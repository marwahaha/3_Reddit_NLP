**match events**

****

**1' [](/whistle)start of first half**

**3'** lucky bounce squirts through for [](/por)valeri, his shot is straight to [](/lag)bingham, though.

**7'** an excellent curling through ball from [](/por)guzman to find [](/por)blanco, but he doesn't get enough power on the shot.

**14'** poor cross is way behind [](/lag)zlatan, but he somehow gets a toe to it and turns it of the upright!

**16'** free kick swung in bounces through to [](/lag)ibrahimovic, but he can't get his header anywhere close.

**21'** curling left-footed shot from [](/por)blanco at the top of the box is punched away by [](/lag)bingham

**22'** touched back to set up [](/lag)steres, but his shot is driven over the crossbar.

**32'** penalty!  [](/por)dielna challenges for the header, but the referee judges that he charged through [](/lag)zlatan to do so!

**33' [](/goal)goal!!!** no mistake as [](/lag)ibrahimovic buries the pk! **[](/lag)los angeles galaxy 1-0 [](/por)portland timbers**

**40'** shot from inside the arch by [](/por)blanco is too high.

**44' [](/goal)goal!!!** excellent passing play from portland sees the ball go from [](/por)guzman to [](/por)valeri and back, then squared across to [](/por)ebobisse for a tap-in! **[](/lag)los angeles galaxy 1-1 [](/por)portland timbers**

**45'+2 [](/whistle)half time [](/lag)los angeles galaxy 1-1 [](/por)portland timbers**

****

**46' [](/whistle)start of second half**

**48'** pitch invader, and ""espno fun zone"" refuses to show them.

**49'** low shot/cross by [](/por)moreira is close to a reaching [](/por)ebobisse, but ends up wide of the net.

**53'** in by [](/lag)alessandrini finds [](/lag)zlatan, but his off-balance header is out for a goal kick.

**59'** yellow card to [](/por)blanco[](/yellow) for a somewhat retaliatory foul on [](/lag)corona.

**60'** low cross in by [](/lag)feltscher is to [](/lag)ibra, but [](/por)cascante blocks and [](/por)attinella covers.

**63'** header off the corner by [](/lag)polenta is not on target.

**64'** penalty!  [](/lag)zlatan takes it into the box, [](/por)attinella off his line, swede goes down, [](/whistle)unkel points to the spot!

**65'** dissent by [](/por)valeri[](/yellow) earns a booking.

**66' [](/goal)goal!!!** a cheeky panenka pk by [](/lag)ibrahimovic puts the galaxy back in front! **[](/lag)los angeles galaxy 2-1 [](/por)portland timbers**

**67'** hard shot by [](/por)valeri is off target.

**68'** the assistant coach for the timbers, [](/por)carlos llamosa, is ejected from the sideline.

**68'** time wasting by [](/lag)dos santos[](/yellow) and he's cautioned for it.

**69'** [](/por)polo[](/sub-on) replaces ebobisse[](/sub-off)

**70'** chance for a hatty for [](/lag)zlatan[](/offside) who is offside, saved by [](/por)attinella anyway.

**74'** [](/lag)alessandrini[](/sub-off) makes way for pontius[](/sub-on)

**75'** another yellow card, this to [](/lag)lletget[](/yellow) for fouling [](/por)blanco.

**76'** [](/lag)antuna[](/sub-off) exits and boateng[](/sub-on) is on.

**80'** after playing the pass, [](/lag)zlatan[](/yellow) intentionally trips [](/por)chara and is booked for it.

**82'** [](/lag)skjelvik thinks he's [](/lag)zlatan, but his heel flick is into the side netting.

**87'** [](/por)melano[](/sub-on) is on for dielna[](/sub-off)

**89'** cross by [](/lag)skjelvik is too high for [](/lag)ibra to turn on frame, and he let's him know it should be [low low low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyh7_gzp4tg).

**90'+2** final portland sub is [](/por)conechny[](/sub-on) for guzman[](/sub-off)

**90'+3** confusion in the la back line leads to a chance for [](/por)melano, but he's to inept to do anything with it.

**90'+5 [](/whistle)full time [](/lag)los angeles galaxy 2-1 [](/por)portland timbers**

###triviality

**[](/cin) fc cincinnati:** which fc cincinnati player has played in the most games against the philadelphia union? *(answered first by /u/slunion_20 - eric alexander has played in 9 games against the union, starting 8 of them.)*

**[](/phi) philadelphia union:** the union have a reputation for not losing to lower-division teams (although fc cincinnati is no longer a lower-division team. who was the last lower-division team that the union played in an official match and failed to win? *(answered first by /u/slunion_20 - the rochester rhinos, who the union needed penalty kicks to advance against in the 2015 us open cup. remember, games that end in a penalty shootout are legally a draw.)*

**[](/mls) neutral:** who's the only player to score four goals in a single half in an mls game? *(answered first by /u/serious_black - patrick mullins, who scored four in the second half of a 2017 game between dc united and the san jose earthquakes.)*

***

###first half

1' - [](/whistle) and we're off in this one! cincinnati in the blue, philadelphia in the white!

1' - vazquez goes to check on mattocks who apparently got hit in the face.

4' - rain seems to be coming down harder; no word yet on whether the animals have started to pair up.

9' - union seem to be content to hold with possession here; keeping cincinnati from counterattacking.

11' - union with the first corner kick of the match; aaronson serves it up but no one can put a head on it to put it in!

12' - picault crosses it in and spencer richey comes up with it!

14' - garza crosses it in and trusty is very lucky not to be called for an illegal backpass there; this redditor doesn't think it was but has seen it called.

16' - lasso with the long ball but blake gathers it in like marty haugen.

19' - will someone at phl17 get rid of the stupid goldbergs commercials.

20' - the weather conditions really starting to wreak havoc on the teams.

24' - aaronson slots it in for accam, and it's knocked away for a corner.

25' - marco fabian with the shot but it's wide right!

27' - lamah slots it into the back of the net but [](/offside) the ar has given offside.

31' - aaronson with the shot but richey parries it aside for the corner!

34' - spencer richey with his best manuel neuer impression to clear it out!

37' - cruz is down and looks like he's in pain.

38' - union keep earning corners, this is going to be their seventh.

39' - elliott gets his head on the corner but he puts it wide!

42' - cincy gets their first corner of the match... but blake able to make the stop.

45'+1 - one minute of stoppage time.

45'+1 - fabian's shot is deflected by lasso but spencer richey with the save!

45'+2 - and that's the half, and we are scoreless. forty-five minutes down, forty-five to go!

###second half

46' - as okgo might note, here it goes again!

50' - picault fouls lasso in an advanced position.

51' - lamah with the point blank shot but blake makes the save!

52' - cincinnati with a few corner kicks in a row here... and now blake is down. this is not good.

56' - deplagne takes down fabian and out comes the spray can. free kick for the union.

58' - **[](/goal) goal, philadelphia!** accam around lasso and pokes it in a la arsenal! union up 2-0!

59' - [](/sub) saief in for manneh for cincy's first sub.

62' - accam stumbles in the box but that didn't appear to be a foul.

65' - [](/sub) accam comes out, burke comes in, for philly's first sub.

68' - union win another corner.

71' - [](/sub) fabian out, monteiro in for philly's second sub; stanko in for ulloa for cincy's second.

73' - aaronson's shot is blocked!

75' - deplagne crosses it in but gaddis able to deal with it.

76' - [](/sub) cruz off, amaya in as cincy makes their last sub.

78' - lamah down briefly.

83' - wagner gets called for the foul on deplagne; that probably should be a yellow but this referee seems to have left his cards in the boot room.

84' - aaronson's shot is bobbled but richey eventually gets there!

89' - fc cincinnati with a late corner here...

90' - [](/sub) aaronson off for creavalle for the union's last sub.

90'+1 - three minutes of stoppage time.

90'+2 - burke with the shot just wide!

90'+4 - and that's the game! union take all three points tonight with a 2-0 victory!",WJMorris3,mls

i asked again if it could be changed since, you know, there was no basketball game and there was the local soccer team actually playing. they changed it. 5 minutes later i saw a guy talk to the bartender and 2 seconds later, the channel was changed to what i assume was the post game to the miami open tennis. personally i hate how it is so easy to just change away from mls but not other sports.

**1' [](/whistle)start of first half**

**7'** good pass for [](/tfc)jozy, his shot forces a great save by [](/nyc)johnson, rebound is put into the stands by [](/tfc)morrow.

~~**9' [](/goal)goal!!!**  nice ball by [](/tfc)bradley, deflected header comes back to [](/tfc)morrow, he rips a shot and it's deflected by [](/nyc)sweat into the net!~~

**10'** after var steps in, offside is called on [](/tfc)delgado[](/offside) on the build-up to the goal.

**25'** it's in the net off the foot of [](/tfc)pozuelo[](/offside), but he is clearly in an offside position.

**26'** long ball over the top to a sliding [](/nyc)ring, but it's a simple save for [](/tfc)bono.

**29' [](/goal)goal!!!** finally toronto gets it in without the flag coming up!  [](/tfc)pozuelo with some slick moves to get into the box, a precise square pass finds [](/tfc)altidore, and he finishes! **[](/tfc)toronto fc 1-0 [](/nyc)new york city fc**

**42'** a hard, rising shot by [](/tfc)pozuelo near the top of the box forces a save from [](/nyc)johnson.

****

**46' [](/whistle)start of second half**

**50'** free kick by [](/tfc)pozeulo skips just wide of the post.

**51'** it's off the post!  [](/nyc)medina sends it in and off the upright!  follow-up by [](/nyc)mitrita is saved by [](/tfc)bono.

**54'** what a block from [](/nyc)callens to deny the spinning shot by [](/tfc)jozy at point-blank range!

**55'** corner finds [](/tfc)altidore, but his header is saved by [](/nyc)johnson.

**57'** we're headed to var after [](/tfc)altidore goes down in the box.

**58'** after review, it's clear [](/nyc)callens pulled [](/tfc)altidore down by the shirt.  penalty!

**58' [](/goal)goal!!!** the cheekiest of pk's is converted by [](/tfc)pozuelo! **[](/tfc)toronto fc 2-0 [](/nyc)new york city fc**

**60'** [](/nyc)castellanos[](/sub-on) replaces ofori[](/sub-off)

**66'** yellow card issued to [](/nyc)castellanos[](/yellow) for a reckless tackle on [](/tfc)moor.

**71'** cut back to [](/tfc)delgado, he curls a shot, tipped over the bar by [](/nyc)johnson.

**72'** [](/nyc)lewis[](/sub-on) comes on for tajouri-shradi[](/sub-off)

**77'** great chance for [](/tfc)altidore to get the brace, but [](/nyc)johnson gets a palm to the shot.

**78'[](/goal)golazo!!!** holy shit, what a goal.  [](/tfc)osorio feeds [](/tfc)pozuelo, who chips it in and completely embarrasses [](/nyc)johnson with a looping shot for the second time tonight! **[](/tfc)toronto fc 3-0 [](/nyc)new york city fc**

**79'** end of the night for [](/tfc)pozuelo[](/sub-off) who is replaced by chapman[](/sub-on)

**82'** [](/tfc)delgado[](/sub-off) makes way for akinola[](/sub-on)

**83' [](/goal)goal!!!** nycfc just opens their defense up, lets the pass from [](/tfc)auro straight into the box, and [](/tfc)chapman slots it home past a helpless [](/nyc)johnson.  **[](/tfc)toronto fc 4-0 [](/nyc)new york city fc**

**89'** final tfc sub sees [](/tfc)jozy[](/sub-off) take a seat and boyd[](/sub-on) enter.

**90'+3 [](/whistle)full time [](/tfc)toronto fc 4-0 [](/nyc)new york city fc**

i also got to do a 30-minute interview with bobby warshaw that starts at the 37-minute mark. we talked about these games but also a about coaching,  judging coaching, the patience of fans in mls, and other topics that i think would be interesting to any fan of the league.

135,/r/mls survivor: round twelve results,"deep in the heart of texas, neither team is particularly well attended, but one was the focus of a lot of attention in round twelve. /r/mls survivor has reached a middle point, with half the league now eliminated from competition, and just nine rounds to go until our three-team finale.

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the twelfth team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 346 votes is...

**houston dynamo**

a few calls in the comments for the dynamo's head were heeded:

* houston dynamo - 98 votes (28.3%)
* portland timbers - 88 votes (25.4%)
* toronto fc - 72 votes (20.8%)
* columbus crew - 19 votes (5.5%)
* fc cincinnati - 15 (4.3%)

[here's a look at the full voting results](https://imgur.com/a/lygdogu)

check back in tomorrow morning for round thirteen's voting thread! 12 clubs remain!

per request, [here's a link to the cumulative vote totals table.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xgzrja06laqmzfgmjanh-hhoswwano9pdg6_b2i7pe/edit?usp=sharing)

142,mls expansion ranking update pre-april 2019 meetings,"mls has stated that sacramento and st. louis are far ahead of every other bid. even with that said there has been activity with other bids and interesting comments from mls. the upcoming meetings will be important not only in moving closer to the awarding of team 28 that was declared to be the final number at the outset of the formalized expansion process, but also to the decision regarding beyond 28. most, if not all, believe it will move beyond. more debate centers on what that final number might be and what markets mls may move into. personally, i think there is a cap, but that it will be determined by what the market can bear, and with more moneyed investment lining up in big metro centers that may mean several more teams. the new tv/media contract and the 2026 world cup loom large in the decision making. i say mls pushes hard to bring in great markets by '26, and those expansion dollars are a steady source of revenue that i do not see the owners and league passing on if everything else lines up. as you will see in the rankings, i believe mls will announce st louis and sacramento this year, and figure out the beyond and how the entry timing looks as it plays out. links to previous rankings, then on to the rankings!

&amp;#x200b;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mls/comments/6omhoz/mls\_expansion\_ranking\_teams\_242526/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mls/comments/6omhoz/mls_expansion_ranking_teams_242526/)

&amp;#x200b;

1t\\. sacramento- this bid has everything the mls has required and more- a very needed western footprint. calling this 28 or 29 is probably fluid, but as their stadium plan is further along than st. louis' call this 28.

&amp;#x200b;

1t\\. st louis- i think mls continues to be enamored with this market- loss or the rams, soccer history, and new great ownership team, and instant rivals. as per above, call this 29 due to stadium catch-up.

&amp;#x200b;

3\\. phx- still a strong bid, but mls' clear statement that the first two are above the others significantly seems to indicate that there are some things to sort out still in phoenix. the stadium plan seems to be the big one. though they have land, there has been mention that they still need to nail down a site. the weather question will persist, even with what rising believed was some engineering solutions. perhaps mls is not convinced? then there is the saturated sports market. phoenix has a lot going for it- desirable geographical location, market size, good ownership group, i expect it to be a top contender for 30 and beyond but with some serious competition arising. 

&amp;#x200b;

4\\. charlotte- this bid moves up as another- detroit- moves down. the charlotte group held a focus group about mls recently and has kept mention of mls on their lips while discussing future stadium plans. tepper has big money and the market would make sense geographically. mls was very excited about the previous charlotte bid, that then quickly fizzled. i see this as a serious bid to push the league towards the 30/31/32 count.

&amp;#x200b;

5\\. las vegas- another bid that moves up. is this a bid? well garber has mentioned lv several times. with the success of the golden knights, the legalization of sports gambling, upcoming arrival of the raiders and the success of the lights fc it seems that the league is now very keen on this market. i believe more is brewing ownership-wise than has been said. this fits the pattern of austin, where garber mentioned it often, though it wasn't a bidder. will vegas be leverage on an existing market or is there money lined up there? my guess is they are working with a new group. this city will threaten phoenix more than any other market for the 30/31/32 spot. 

&amp;#x200b;

6\\. detroit- this bid has officially fallen off. once a final 4 in a race for 4, it is now deemed by mls to be deficient due to the lack of a sss- plan. ford field seems to have been considered by mls, and detroit was announced as final 4 after announcing that they were dropping their sss plan for ff. but now the league has stated clearly that it is a non-starter. if this ownership groups re-ups on a dt sss this bid is back in the game as a favorite. 

&amp;#x200b;

7\\. san diego- this market of a failed bid makes a jump up due to its attractiveness to mls and nothing more than possibilities. sd state did reach out to mls but it is hard to say what, if anything, will come from that. however, if a strong bid were to materialize, sd would make the jump back to favorites in the 30/31/32 spots. 

&amp;#x200b;

8\\. raleigh- this jumps over indy in this ranking for 2 reasons- they have stated that their newest stadium plan is not contingent on getting mls, which means it can get done, and charlotte may stir the waters enough in this geographical area that if it were to go away the triangle just may benefit.

&amp;#x200b;

9\\. indy- there is a new stadium plan, there has been a favorable vote, and new ownership partners- however, government support contingent on receiving an mls bid first makes this unrealistic as mls requires the ducks in a row first. it does seem that this bid will keep working on it though.

&amp;#x200b;

10\\. louisville- not a bidder, but has a new sss being built, has solid success in usl and could push its way in due to the stadium and fan activity. 

&amp;#x200b;

11\\. tampa bay- no longer a bidder, but mlb ownership and what were the workings of a strong stadium plan could still turn this into a contender if minds are changed. the rowdies have solid support, and mls tried once before. 2 other markets got a second shot at it. 

&amp;#x200b;

12\\. san antonio- independently strong support for austin fc (drawing from the austin core) and continued strong support of safc and involvement by the spurs could put this back on the map. san antonio is the 7th most populous city in the us and has a favorable demographic. 

&amp;#x200b;

13\\. okc- this jumps pitt, slightly. not really much here, but a stadium proposal has popped up. 

&amp;#x200b;

14\\. pittsburgh- drops because of stadium talk- by the usl commissioner talking up pittsburgh for that league. there seems to be some lead being taken by usl by the sound of the article. it has been said that their previous venue is expandable and the previous ownership spoke about mls aspirations, those seem to have gone quiet.

8|[](/dal) fc dallas|2-1-1|+2|the brightest showing so far this season for fc dallas and that was with two of our best players missing for international duty. the youth starters and substitutes all shined bright which makes fcd one of the deepest teams in the league. a wrinkle in the front 3 with ferreira up top and badji on the wing showed promise along with aranguiz starting at the 10 and pomykal excelling as the linking 8. i haven't even mentioned hollingshead motm performance.. this team is trending up - how high can they go?|
9|[](/hou) houston dynamo|2-0-1|-1|*no ranking submitted*|
10|[](/min) minnesota united fc|2-1-0|0|like the majority of the league, the loons didn't play this week, so i'm instead going to use this blurb space to congratulate philly and cincy on their performances this past weekend. i look forward to your match this saturday.|
11|[](/nyc) new york fc|0-0-3|-2|no action this week. oh, except we got a striker on the books...|
12|[](/mtl) montreal impact|2-1-0|0|no game this week for the impact, but some bad news as piatti might miss the game against kc as he hasn't trained once since the game against orlando.|
13|[](/atl) atlanta united fc|0-1-2|+1|atlanta united did not play this week, but pity martinez started for argentina, making him the first mls player ever to play for the argentina national team. pity has not had a good season for atlanta so far, but that is likely to change with sufficient time, however, he suffered a hamstring injury during the match josef martinez played for the venezuela national team and scored on a pk. franco escobar started for atlutd 2 and is back in training, this is a very good thing for the team.|
14|[](/tfc) toronto fc|2-0-0|-1|*no ranking submitted*|
15|[](/cin) fc cincinnati|2-1-1|+1|*no ranking submitted*|
16|[](/phi) philadelphia union|1-2-1|+1|the union won a massive match against a shorthanded columbus crew side over the international break. their win was sparked by the impressive 2 goal effort of david accam, who bagged an emotional brace following the death of his father. furthermore, strong performances from brendan aaronson, fafa picault, and the much maligned haris medjunanin helped get the win for the boys in blue. credit should also go to jim curtin for having bedoya and ilsinho move back to support medjunanin more. however, beating columbus without arguably their two top players (steffen and trapp) and their starting striker (gyasi zardes) is nothing to write home about, and all that this win did for me is prove that the union can win a game if it is against an undermanned opponent at home. i'm more relieved that we avoided dropping points to a weaker side at home than excited that we won an actual soccer match.|
17|[](/por) portland timbers|0-2-1|-2|will an international window break or bolster the timber's chances in carson this weekend? almost feels like a win if we don't allow three points on a loss at this point, april is knocking on the door. |
18|[](/rsl) real salt lake|1-2-1|0|a new mls record set with 7 homegrown players in a single game.  i think most everyone would have expected this game to be very lopsided, but rsl's youth stepped up and took the game down to the last minute. there's a lot of positives to take away from the game.|
19|[](/orl) orlando city sc|1-1-2|+1|the purple lions pull an upset over the red bulls, an evenly matched game that seemed to be a “whoever puts it in the back of the net first is sure to win it” type match from the early goings, and it ended that way as kljestan slid one into the corner past his former teammates. it was a physical match, with both teams pressing aggressively both defenses were demanded to make high quality stops highlighted by some solid blocks from former lion amro tarek for ny, an early stop by rowe, and a bicycle kick denial on the line from ascues to lock down the win.  the players really emphasized high energy as there was a players-only meeting before the match. the team will surely look to capitalize on that performance as they return home to face red hot dc united sunday, march 31st.|
20|[](/col) colorado rapids|0-2-2|-1|the old saying is draw at home and lose on the road right? it was a pretty standard rapids road performance in dallas, which is to say we took an l. went down 1-0, then managed to not get screwed by var on a richochet equalizer which barely crossed the line. oh, then dallas won the game with a nice rebound goal. still looking for that sweet sweet win. |
21|[](/chi) chicago fire|0-2-1|0|still no defense|
22|[](/van)vancouver whitecaps fc|0-3-0|+1|international break, no games played.|
23|[](/ner) new england revolution|0-3-1|-1|the revs just lost to an expansion team missing half their starting lineup. to quote the smiths, ""that joke isn't funny anymore.""|
24|[](/sje) san jose earthquakes|0-3-0|0|almeyda has been dissappointed by the wrectched start, all jobs are up for grabs.|

170,/r/mls survivor: round twelve vote,"sporting kansas city got simply obliterated in a surprisingly high-voted round, jumping several other targeted teams in recent votes. we're down to 13 teams, and we'll knock it down to just half the league remaining with today's vote!

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

188,what would it take to win ccl next year? discussion.,"first off,  please be civil/not completely dismissive about this in the comment section. i know this is a loooong post. i've seen threads like this for over a decade and things can get sideways fast. usually the person proposing this is hellbent on having it happen. i'm not, so that should help. moving on.

after tfc, atlanta, nyrb, and houston got eliminated their was a very vocal and sizable minority who think ""mls needs to take the training wheels off"" to regularly challenge for ccl titles and win. i personally don't think we are in the training wheel stage anymore and are improving leaps and bounds. in some of my downtime i decided had a mini project of ""what would mls need to do to have a good chance of winning ccl?"".

i've read over roster rules, salaries from the players unions, got facts and figures from team blogs, ""ambition rankings"", poured over transfermarkt about teams from mexico, argentina, brazil and here. here's what i came up with.

to beat liga mx's best, teams need to have better players and be two deep in every position. not exactly earth-shattering analysis. in order to do that those things the salary budget needs to be raised significantly and it would be necessary for mls to add international slots to get so many higher quality players in the short-term.

so i used the september 15th, 2018 mls players salary guide to figure out what teams could get with their dollar. i determined rough tiers of player by salary and position. i created a two-deep team with players who i thought were good enough to win ccl and who were fairly paid for there caliber of play. i added the salaries up and determined that would be a good salary budget. 

a couple things worth noting. i tried to not use a lot of domestic players as examples because they are typically underpaid and the league would have to get a lot more foreign players to fill a roster up of this level of talent. if international slots and salary cap open up i could see goalkeepers being easily upgraded. cb's at the top end of salaries have really underperformed, the league needs to do better. there are almost no tam level outside backs and that that should change, the best outside backs are basically all underpaid. it was hard to find many high level box to box midfielders in the league. they are largely attacking or hold midfielders, it seems.

so here is what i came up with: twenty-six players players are non-minimum salary players on the senior roster with six are all on a minimum salary salary of 100k for simplicity sake. the if you make more than 12.5 percent of the senior team budget you are a dp. you have 3 dp slots. in this hypothetical roster the player listed means that caliber of player, not that specific player. since i don't mean the exact player i am listing rough salary level of a ""player x type"". in this team no player listed no player would qualify as a dp on salary alone. in order to have mls rosters be a lot better by next year i think their should be 14 tradable international player slots per team to acquire all these players. i also think the league would need to loosen up and allow players to spend more on transfer fees. i would propose that teams can spend half of the senior team salary budget on transfer fees per year before it counts against the salary budget. don't know how much of the ""war chest"" should come from the league and how much would come from the franchise. if franchise owners wanted chartered flights that is another 2 million per team, per year.

per player average: 548,437.50

player minimum: 100,000

per team transfer fee budget off cap: 8.475 million

transfer fee budget off cap for league available: 203.4 million

player average not on player minimum: 651,923.08

2018 total player compensation was 261.1 million with average of $376,258 and increase of 18.6 percent compared to 2017

with the same 18.6 percent increase to 2019 player salary would be $309,664,600 and then $367,262,215.60 in 2020 before transfer fees and dp money.

difference my hypothetical salary budget for 2020 and 2 years of 18.6 percent increase from 2018 would be $53,937,784.40 or 7.81 percent. i'm admittedly comparing 2018 total player salary to pre-dp player salary but only 13 2018 players from 2018 would qualify as dp's in this hypothetical 2020 mls. also the increase for 2019 won't be 18.6 percent. but that gap was surprising small. 

there is no way mls in 2020 would/could afford to have a pool of 421.2 million dollars a year on pre-dp player salaries alone. seventy percent of that is doable. that would be 294.84 million dollars, just 33.74 million more than mls spent on players overall last year. easily done with improved tv contracts, jersey sponsorship, partnerships, signage, stadium naming rights, etc. so i would propose seventy percent of the salary budget is pooled together and each team is able to spend an extra thirty percent out of pocket in addition to dp's over salary threshold. basically teams at seventy percent budget would be at atlanta/seattle level of spending for salary.

this might cut down parity further and push some owners to the limit financially. liga mx already has a higher percentage of domestic players than mls. having a league this talented and deep would also push many non-star domestic players out of the league. many domestic starters would be pushed to the bench. having a big jump in salary budget would lead to inflation but increasing foreign player slots would help mitigate that somewhat. having more talented players would make it harder for academy players to break through in the short and medium term. ticket prices would also be raised considerably to pay for this increase in spending. this would probably necessary to challenge for ccl starting next year.

let's all some fees up if a team wanted to max out this hypothetical. 17.55 million for salary budget + 8.475 million for transfer fees + 2 million for chartered flights + 5 million to run academy + up to 5 million for a reserve team. that's 38.325 million before dp spending, staff, running costs, etc. this level of investment would put the bigger mls teams with the elite of mexico, argentina and brazil when it comes to yearly team spending. a top mls team could put in a respectable showing against top teams in the western hemisphere.

211,/r/mls survivor: round eleven results,"for some reason this round, the total number of votes boosted way back up, and one specific team seemed to be the target of everyone's ire. this club only made their top five debut last round, but that seems to have been enough to remind everyone that, ""hey, we really don't like those guys, let's get them out of here"", and this group of wizards didn't have a trick up their sleeves.

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the eleventh team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 842 votes is...

**sporting kansas city**

sorry sporting kc fans, at least you'll make it further in the usoc like you do every year, that must be nice...:

* sporting kansas city - 352 votes (41.8%)
* houston dynamo - 214 votes (25.4%)
* toronto fc - 105 votes (12.5%)
* portland timbers - 57 votes (6.8%)
* columbus crew - 39 (4.6%)

notes: 

- row numbers are *home games*, not *week numbers*. only mls league games are tracked.
- numbers aren't people passing through the gates. attendance numbers are reported by teams, and most teams report tickets sold.
- capacities are defined by teams, not by the number of seats in venues. (this helps account for teams in nfl-compatible stadiums, while applying a consistent standard.)
- ***hicap***: games played in larger-than-normal venues. (once played, displayed as ***[attendance]***.)
- **bold**: sellout (of regular capacity)
- 'attendance\*': mid-week match
- '\####': current week's matches

week 4 saw clshoaf win the first division for the first time, while the second division's roqxwalker had the best overall score, winning promotion to the first division in the process.

usl league one debuts this week, however based on the lukewarm reception to the league in last week's survey and the fact that, unlike mls and usl championship, it is not tracked by fivethirtyeight, i have not included it in this week's game. i added a survey question to the end of this week's google form with an eye towards including it in the future. your input would be greatly appreciated!

good luck to everyone with week 5!

243,/r/mls survivor: round eleven vote,"first minnesota united fc, now real salt lake, the teams that previously slipped quietly under the radar seem to have become the focus of concerted efforts to root them out. it's a toss-up every round now between the frequently hated and the frequently ignored, who will draw the most attention this time?

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

polls will close at 9 a.m. et tomorrow and results will be posted shortly afterwards.

270,comments on mediapro's debut production of canmnt (10-year contract to produce canpl),"(crosspost from r/canadianpl)

today was a bright day for canadian soccer. beyond the 4-1 performance that left them tied with haiti atop the nations' league qualifying, today's broadcast was a trial run for mediapro's production of canadian soccer. mediapro, a global company with lots of experience but unknown to most of us in canada, has signed on for a 10-year production of canadian premier league broadcasting. they announced very recently that they would produce today's match against french guiana, delivered to tsn to provide commentary over and to broadcast. they certainly delivered. mediapro and tsn together did a very professional job. mediapro produced the broadcast, so was responsible for most of the video, and tsn provided kristian jack, steven caldwell, terry dunfield, and the halftime show.

for the last decade, i've been watching choppy youtube, facebook, and concacaf feeds of canmnt matches, with the occasional tsn broadcast (of varying quality) thrown in. today, the video (which i believe was mediapro's primary responsibility, per their press release, and from the feel of the broadcast today) was 4k, ultra slow motion, multiple camera angles, well-paced feeds, and just overall very professional. a few hiccups here and there, but if this is what the cpl video is like, we'll be in very good hands.

considering the short-notice announcement of mediapro's coverage of this game, they pulled off an extremely well-rounded, ""it-aint-our-first-rodeo"" sort of performance. i left this game feeling very good about the future of cpl broadcasts, if mediapro is in charge of production.

separately, a few pieces outside out mediapro shone today. the cpl advertisements (one for the centre circle app, and a general one for the league flipping through the seven clubs/markets) were really slick and professional, and certainly not an embarrassment to the league. appealing to a young generation. whatever you think of jack, caldwell, dunfield, etc., they are a seasoned professional crew that were better than many previous canmnt broadcast crews (some non-existent, like for the new zealand match). finally, the nike ad with alphonso davies and christine sinclair was pretty dope. on a personal note, thumbs up to rogers for getting tsn2 up and running in 3 minutes after i ordered it specifically for this match.

all-in-all, i had a great experience with canadian media, and specifically canadian soccer media, today. mediapro will do a great job with cpl and did a great job today, tsn has clearly done soccer for long enough that they can pull off a broadcast that does the team justice, and the country is clearly getting hyped for soccer here, rather than soccer abroad.

###triviality

**[](/phi) philadelphia:** the union have defeated the crew 8 times in their history, which is the fourth-most for philadelphia. who has philadelphia defeated most often in mls play? *(first answered correctly by /u/dietcola26 - new england revolution, who the union have defeated 13 times.)*

**[](/clb) columbus:** federico higuain is inching towards crew sc's all-time record for assists with the team. who currently holds that record? *(first answered correctly by /u/magicmangregory - robert warzycha, who has 61 to higuain's 59.)*

**[](/mls) neutral:** in what very nice country does the current leading scorer of concacaf nations league qualifying (as of this writing) play his club football? *(first answered correctly by /u/twh1297 - rangelo janga of curacao plays for astana, in kazakhstan.)*

297,"for montserrat to qualify for the 2019 gold cup, this is what needs to happen:","as it currently stands, montserrat (9 pts) sits at no. 7 in the concacaf nations league qualifying table - meaning they can't qualify for league a, will qualify for league b, and may make the 2019 gold cup if they remain in the top 10.

this is what needs to happen:

march 23rd

- no. 18 suriname (4 pts) v. no. 11 saint kitts and nevis (6 pts) (optimal outcome: suriname wins or draw, otherwise sk&amp;n overtakes mon on goal differential.)
- no. 10 guyana (6 pts) v. no. 15 belize (6 pts) (optimal outcome: draw)
- no. 16 el salvador (6 pts) v. no. 5 jamaica (9 pts) (optimal outcome: jamaica wins or draw to keep el salvador out of the gold cup and below mon)

march 24th

- no. 12 dominican republic (6 pts) v. no. 9 bermuda (6 pts) (optimal outcome: draw)
- no. 3 canada (9 pts) v. no. 14 french guiana (6 pts) (optimal outcome: canada wins or draw)
- no. 24 barbados (3 pts) v. no. 13 nicaragua (6 pts) (optimal outcome: barbados wins or draw)

if montserrat is going to qualify, at most only three of these teams can win their games over the next two days (saint kitts and nevis, guyana, belize, el salvador, dominican republic, bermuda, french guiana, nicaragua). if three win, mon will be no. 10 and be the final team into the gold cup. anymore than three and mon finds itself under the 10th spot and outside the competition.

first we have **dallas** and **colorado** on unimas at 5:45 (what kind of a kick off is that?!?) featuring in the only nationally televised mls game this week, i dont know what will be worse, the ratings or dallas's attendance.

moving right along, we have a game of groups of people, **union people** and **crew people**. neat.

my personal biasis for this week is **orlando** visiting **nyrb** which will surely bring back my machinistsic tendencies from getting pleasure of watching my team get destroyed. both teams can almost field a decent starting lineup with their absentee lists, and rb will surely get a win today.

**salt lake fc** visit **real los angeles** for the first time since getting pushed out of the playoffs they weren't even supposed to be in.

303,/r/mls survivor: round ten vote,"after some of the bigger teams got voted off single entity island, it felt as if /r/mls survivor had reached a new stage, where the number of teams in danger each round rose to three or four. now, with the elimination of the first under-the-radar candidate, minnesota united fc, it feels as if we've again reached a new point in the game. if the loons and their polite inoffensiveness aren't safe, who is?

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

[**vote to eliminate a team here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlscvdtyfhvtilxmmtrhvm3e6cbn8-ifihlrwpgsybaszv4qlzw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

*google account required to participate, one response per user*

polls will close at 9 a.m. et tomorrow and results will be posted shortly afterwards.

up top we have a battle between larin, david and cavallini which is the best depth we've seen in a 20 years. 4 years ago larin was the undisputed starter, while today the question is usually cavallini vs david. i wouldn't count larin out though, the last coach didn't like him and besiktas are actively searching for a replacement now. he's arguably the best pure finisher of the bunch, although that seems to have been missing on the cmnt. at the moment though, cavallini is the starter for me. he's big, strong and can use both his head and feet effectively. david works well as the ""super sub"" as his speed will change up the game whether that's behind cavallini as a secondary striker or as a winger or a like for like switch.

the winger group has to be the most exciting group in canadian history. davies, hoilet, millar, tabla, david, arfield can all play a winger role, and play it with ease. arfield and david will likely start elsewhere but it should be noted they are available for depth. i actually think this is the biggest conundrum from team canada fans: davies and hoilet are both at their best on the left side of the pitch. personally i believe hoilet is garbage on the right side of the pitch as he is without a doubt, an inside forward who is most effective cutting in onto his right foot. davies is a better winger, driving wide using his speed and strength to either force himself into the center of the pitch or delivering a cross from the outside, but i see him being the player moved to play on the right.

central midfield is intriguing as well osorio, arfield, tiebert, hutchinson, piette, kaye. i reckon it's osorio/kaye, hutchinson, arfield. depending on whether they are looking for a more offensive or defensive midfield.

the achilles heel is definitely going to be our backline, short of our lord and saviour lord borjan may he keep us safe as the hex is dark and full of scorers. personally i think cb is a bigger question then our fullbacks. teams in modern soccer can't operate without decent fullbacks and i actually think we have two in adekugbe(lb) and godinho(rb). fun fact: they are the only choices imo as they are really the only fullbacks playing decent, quality minutes. centerback is more up for debate and i don't think the quality of the top choices improves much. do you go with henry and cornelius, ignoring their average form for the whitecaps? maybe call vitoria back into the fold from poland as he was starting quite regularly.

who do you think is the strongest line-up we can field against good competition?

326,/r/mls survivor: round nine results,"sorry for the delay on the post, a few doc appointments today and that takes precedence! i did freeze the vote at 10 a.m. et this morning, so the voting duration was the same as other rounds. at its core, survivor is a game of strategy, and sometimes the best strategy isn't to target the obvious candidates for expulsion from the island. sometimes the optimal strategy is to find those hiding in the background, lurking, hoping to avoid notice and outlast those that do. unfortunately for one team this week, their strategy of polite non-offensiveness proved to be their downfall.

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the ninth team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 412 votes is...

**minnesota united fc**

the poor loons. one of the lowest vote-getters of the entire competition to this point found themselves targeted for exactly that reason:

* minnesota united fc - 84 votes (20.4%)
* toronto fc - 82 votes (19.9%)
* fc dallas - 56 votes (13.6%)
* portland timbers - 48 votes (11.7%)
* columbus crew - 30 (7.3%)

[here's a look at the full voting results](https://imgur.com/a/iachu92)

check back in tomorrow morning for round ten's voting thread! 15 clubs remain!

377,"don't believe the spin: mas' complaint is about miami-dade county, not politicians","i've seen a few people defending mas' tweet, they're trying to claim that he's angry about corruption in miami and that it's the commissioners and bureaucracy forcing him and beckham to build training facilities in broward county.


this isn't true at all. he's whining because he wasn't able to use the backroom deals developers usually use to force their way onto public lands and escape scrutiny by moving quickly. if he wanted to build on a public park in miami they would have had to wait until 2020 for a ballot amendment, giving journalists plenty of time to look into the deal and whether or not it was actually good for the people of miami.


 [the miami herald article about his tweet](https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/mls/article228181589.html) explained the real barrier at the beginning and end.

&gt; while the team is slated to play home games at a 25,000-seat miami stadium, **mas abandoned miami-dade as a training site over complications tied to a county charter amendment requiring voter approval to build on a county park.**


&gt; he[mayor carlos gimenez] and mas were in talks for building the mls training complex at amelia earhart park outside hialeah, but **gimenez said the soccer group did not want to wait for approval by voters**. a charter provision in miami-dade bars special elections for approving park construction, so mas and partners would have to wait until 2020 for a potential green light.


[the charter section this all refers to is 7.02](https://www.miamidade.gov/charter/library/charter.pdf)(that's a direct link to the pdf of the charter): which says that parks should be used for the public and protected from commercial exploitation. here's the section in detail:

&gt; **in furtherance of this policy parks shall be used for public park purposes only,** and subject to the limited exceptions set forth in this article, **there shall be no permanent structures** or private commercial advertising erected in a public park **or private commercial use of a public park **or renewals, expansions, or extensions of existing leases, licenses, or concessions to private parties of public park property, **unless** each such structure, lease, license, renewal, expansion, extension, concession or use shall be **approved by a majority vote of the voters in a county-wide referendum.** nothing in this article shall prevent any contract with federally tax-exempt not-for-profit youth, adult, and senior cultural, conservation and parks and recreation program providers.


of course, if he's really so concerned about the state of fields in miami-dade county he could create a non-profit to fund upkeep and the creation of new fields, that wouldn't even require voter approval.",RunShootDrink,mls

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

minnesota united is the only non-new expansion team to have over 100% growth, and second overall behind lafc. 

orlando city is the slowest growing subreddit, probably because their fans have nothing to live for. 

atlanta is the largest subreddit, by a lot, but i'm not sure all those subs aren't just the same person voting over and over again.

fccincy has had quite a growth this year, probably because there's nothing else to do in cincinatti.

i'm surprised houston is still growing, you wouldn't know it with the way their attendance looks.

edit: forgot to mention, these data points were taken at 3/20/19 and the ones from last year were taken from 3/20/18, except for like two who didn't have recorded numbers on that date and i took it from 3/21/18 instead.",Epicallytossed,mls

| rank | team  | record | movement| blurb |
|:-----------|:------------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
1|[](/sea) seattle sounders fc|3-0-0|+1|normally, 2 goals at home is enough to pull out a win, but not against this deadly offense that the sounders have. 4 goals by 4 different players, including morris and ruidiaz, who are tied forthe league lead in goals with 3. even with chicago putting a solid 12 shots on goal, frei was able to prove that he still is his old self, saving 10 of them. next week, the sounders have a bye due to internanational play, where the sounders will be well reprsented, including jordan morris and christian roldan both being called up for the usa squad.|
2|[](/lafc) los angeles fc|2-0-1|-1|lafc showed true grit to come from behind twice to escape with 1 pt in their firs away match of the season vs. nyfc.  adama diomande could have made it 9 points from 3 games but it wasn't to be as his shot from 5 meters out sailed past the near post - if only he could have that opportunity back again!  nyfc leveraged their small field to force lafc to often play on the counter, resulting in a match with many fouls to slow down the black and gold offense.  blessing was electric and vela proved the hero yet again with a brace.  lafc played without 2 starters, nguyen and lee, and its a fair result that they took at least 1 point from this match.  i predict 3 points in the upcoming fixture against rsl.  i hope it rains on saturday.  revenge is a dish best served cold.|
3|[](/dcu) d.c. united|2-0-1|+1|well that was just fun. we just scored five goals in one game, led by a wayne rooney hat trick. this dc team is clicking in every phase of the game and it is just so much fun. the most surprising part to me, though, is how solid we've been defensively, allowing zero goals in 270 minutes of play so far. after a week off during the international break, dc heads down to orlando for the chance to start the season with 10 points in 4 games (which, for reference, was dc's total points at the beginning of july last year).|
4|[](/nyrb) new york red bulls|1-0-1|+1|*no ranking submitted*|
5|[](/clb) columbus crew sc|2-0-1|+1|big news out of the weekend was robinho starting over justin meram as caleb porter declared this for ""tactical reasons""..take that as you would like but robinho did seem to add a little more juice to the attack and simply not turning the bal over as much as meram has. he'll get another opportunity with meram on internatioanl duty. speaking of which, 5 starters are projected to be out this week in philly. if they can get 3 points out of this week that will be huge for this group heading into a home game vs atlanta.|
6|[](/skc) sporting kansas city|1-1-1|-3|dead. dead to us, rubio.  you took what we gave you, a platform to your name, and shoved it in our faces.  i'm not going to credit him so much as tim taking a touch across goal without looking first.  why didn't anyone say ""man on?""  johnny, the super sub goal scorer, russell is in prime form.  also, monterrey were just beaten by tijuana this past weekend so everyone writing off skc should know that a ccl title is still in the picture.  shoutout to the montreal folks as i will be traveling to the match against nycfc in may.  w/e the result ends up being this next match, just know i will be paying a visit and plan to root for the impact.  #fuckracism|
7|[](/lag) la galaxy|2-1-0|**+5**|this team looked nothing like the team from the previous weeks.  the passing and pressing looked like nothing seen in la in years.  movement off the ball left huge holes for the galaxy to pass through.  at one point the galaxy connected 25 consecutive passes before scoring their second goal.  however as good as the team looked, there were still some questions.  bingham looked shaky in goal once again and the d gave up a late goal to make it closer than it should have been.  it remains to be seen what the team will look like as the injuried players beging to return.|
8|[](/hou) houston dynamo|2-0-1|**+5**|the dynabros bow out of ccl after losing 1-0 (3-0 on aggregate) in monterrey against tigres uanl, they played very well defensively considering the circumstances aside from that silly goal but overall the mexican side just had a truckton of talent and depth to neutralize my dear team. moving on to much more *important* business, they still managed to hold on and beat vancouver whitecaps thanks to a brace by memo rodriguez and a debatable penalty shout. i feel like houston is slowly improving defensively but they have got to figure out a consistent defensive rotation. we are not playing this week so i am going back to watching rgvfc while i wait for animal crossing for the switch.|
9|[](/nyc) new york fc|0-0-3|+1|i'm a broken record, but as the weeks pass it isn't any less true. we need a striker. if we had a smart number 9 with a nose for goal, i'd actually feel pretty good about our squad. but we don't. so i don't. it's not as doom-and-gloom as i had sort of feared, and lafc is quality competition, but there's a glaring hole in our team and i won't feel optimistic until we get an answer. shouts to lafc's excellent cross-country away support.|
10|[](/min) minnesota united fc|2-1-0|-3|the loons lost. it was bound to happen. the comeback at the end of the game was somewhat encouraging and it'll be interesting to see how the team adapts now that adrian heath is back at the helm.|
10|[](/dal) fc dallas|1-1-1|-1|*no ranking submitted*|
12|[](/mtl) montreal impact|2-1-0|+4|while the score looks good and the impact did play well, orlando made it easy by giving us 2 goals with very poor defensive mistakes and by dom dwyer missing 3 very solid chances. one thing i really liked about this game is piette's play. he was just as key as usual on recovery but he also made some key passes forward where he usually just plays back or to the side. this ended up quite a frustrating victory however as the inexperienced ref totally lost control of the game, which resulted in very poor sportsmanship by orlando near the end of the game (they played the ball forward instead of giving it back to the impact who had possession prior to novillo's injury) that led to the death of dwyer and a deserved red card for diallo who fell for the trap. this could hurt for our game in kc as diallo has been very solid so far this season.|
13|[](/tfc) toronto fc|2-0-0|+1|new contract, same jozy! after being injured, jozy altadore makes his season debut late in the game to get the game winning goal for tfc. despite a weak goal allowed by bono early on in the second half, tfc played well and got goals when they needed them. that, however, is not the only piece of good news for tfc and the fans. after another off-week, tfc will be receiving alejandro pozuelo just in time for their match against nycfc. although he may not be an important part of the lineup for that match, the abilities he'll bring to the table in weeks to come should be well worth the wait.|
14|[](/atl) atlanta united fc|0-1-2|**-6**|atlanta united had a huge win vs monterey, becoming the first us team to beat them in 10 years and the handed monterey thier first loss in 2019.  however, the team is still having trouble creating chances, and we do not know how much of that is fatigue and how much of that is needing time to gel under the new coach and new lineups.  the next few matches will be very telling.|
15|[](/por) portland timbers|0-2-1|-4|it’s way to early to say portland is one of the league’s worst teams, but the timbers are certainly playing like they want to add a wooden spoon to the trophy case this year. it’s all a long-con so the league looks less rigged when gio gets portland back to another mls cup final.|
16|[](/cin) fc cincinnati|1-1-1|**+6**|*no ranking submitted*|
17|[](/phi) philadelphia union|0-2-1|+3|the union's usual lack of finishing cost them 2 points in their 1-1 draw in atlanta on sunday. 18 year old brendan aaronson attacking mid, who started in replacement of the suspended marco fabian, was the union's man of the match with 1 goal and 2 should be assists (kai wagner deserves an honorable mention here, as he has been a bright spot thus far this season, and he really shone on sunday). unfortunately, fafa picault couldn't capitalize on two golden chances to score, and haris medjunanin yet again failed to track his man into the box, leading to barco's equalizer for atlanta. while there were a lot of good things to come out of this result, the game left me with two questions. firstly, how many more minutes will aaronson get this season with fabian blocking his path into the starting xi (questions 1a and 1b are how much time will anthony fontana and derrick jones get, but i think we all know at this point that curtin won't play them much if at all)? secondly, how long will jim curtin be able to keep his job if the union keep dropping points. while a 1-1 draw with atlanta is not a bad result, the union have not won yet this season. even though the lack of finishing was not due to curtin, the decision to start medjunanin (and the decision to start ilsinho vs. toronto) is up to him, and it has cost us dearly on the defensive end. things are not looking bright in chester right now.|
18|[](/rsl) real salt lake|1-1-1|-3|let dcu celebrate.  rsl was bound to have at least one game where they collapse, hopefully this will be the only one.|
19|[](/col) colorado rapids|0-1-2|0|this game featured and absolute howler of a misplay by a goalie named tim that resulted in a 1-1 draw. and no, that goalie's last name was meila, not howard. diego rubio cashed in on his own team when meila was caught napping retreving a ball. can the rapids hold for a 1-0 win? you know they can't. blomberg gets red carded six minutes after coming on as a sub, but that didn't actually change the result as the resulting free kick was a gorgeous strike to level things. disappointing result, but kansas city is a good team. this team is improved, but they're just not playoff ready.|
20|[](/orl) orlando city sc|0-1-2|-3|montreal continued to be a nightmare opposition against the lions. once again scoring two goals within seconds of each other, (anyone remember june 17, 2017? i certainly do.) and piatti now has 11 out of his 66 mls goals against orlando. it was definitely a boring match, as after conceding two goals, orlando couldn’t get on the ball the following 20 minutes. hijinks ran amuck in the second half, as there were two mass confrontations, the second occurred after higuita restarted on a dropped ball forward into an attack, that saw montreal players rush higuita arguing it was poor sportsmanship. the second confrontation added an ugly ending to the match that saw a red card to montreal’s diallo, for grabbing dwyer by the neck and pushed him. regardless if people say dwyer baited him and milked it. there’s no room for the kind of behavior. orlando city stadium hosts the usa v ecuador match on thursday, while the team travels to harrison to face the red bulls that will be sure to see some rotation in the squad as some players are leaving for their national teams.|
21|[](/chi) chicago fire|0-2-1|-3|can khalil mack play futbol? because holy crap we have no defense. look, there are some gems in the offense, that coupled with gaitan coming may help give pauno a chance to fix the hell hole that is that backline. gaitan opens up a chance to play basti or dax back. yes i know that's not going to be a permanent fix but that could be a decent band aid to stop the bleeding|
22|[](/ner) new england revolution|0-2-1|-1|flag goes up, flag goes down...you can't explain that: https://youtu.be/nueybwtmewo|
23|[](/van)vancouver whitecaps fc|0-3-0|0|at 0-3, the whitecaps are officially off to their worst start in ever in mls. while the offense doesn't seem problematic, the team is third last in the league in goals against. the defense needs to tighen up significantly. there remains hope that the team simply hasn't developed enough chemistry to be effective yet and will pull it together eventually, but if that doesn't happen there will be renewed calls for lenarduzzi to step down.|
24|[](/sje) san jose earthquakes|0-3-0|0|a coach can change a team's ability in possession, defensive structure, and pressing habits in a preseason, but a winning mentality cannot. sj is not the most talented team, but talent is not why this team loses in the manner it does. blown leads and late game collapses have been the theme of sj's losing habit, and at this point you just have to chalk it up to a broken mentality and a lack of desire.|

in an alternate universe, the mls board that meets next month decides that, in a groundbreaking moment for sports across the world, not the owners, nor the players, will decide who joins the league, but those who are most important get to make the most important decisions: the people.

in order for this to work, those who wish to present a case for their city may do so in the comment section below. i will include a link with a poll where you can go vote, but by all means, read the comments first and see if anybody can sway you to their side. i'll also include my thoughts in a comment below. here's the link to the poll, with the cities that have any chance:

[vote here](https://goo.gl/forms/dshiod6wa1qnrra93)

the league will be expanding beyond 28 in these here polls, so if your team doesn't make it in this time, check back tomorrow, and make sure to present your case again. because the expansion committee is now the people, the league will also stop growing when the people say it stops growing. after 28, we'll be doing two at a time. 

to get everything kicked off, i'll include some recent expansion news article, which obviously focus mostly on sacramento and st. louis.

469,/r/mls survivor: round eight vote,"well, my team is out so i don't even care anymore this whole thing is stupid anyway. i mean, who even cares about stupid made up internet polls except /r/atlantaunited? not me, that's for sure. whatever. round eight, blah blah blah, 17 teams remaining, blah blah blah, vote now.

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

[**vote to eliminate a team here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlscjuivsemiimwb_-4yqoa39olyal7uxw_5aelqyee2whzyroq/viewform?usp=sf_link)

*google account required to participate, one response per user*

polls will close at 9 a.m. et tomorrow and results will be posted shortly afterwards.

notes: 

- row numbers are *home games*, not *week numbers*. only mls league games are tracked.
- numbers aren't people passing through the gates. attendance numbers are reported by teams, and most teams report tickets sold.
- capacities are defined by teams, not by the number of seats in venues. (this helps account for teams in nfl-compatible stadiums, while applying a consistent standard.)
- ***hicap***: games played in larger-than-normal venues. (once played, displayed as ***[attendance]***.)
- **bold**: sellout (of regular capacity)
- 'attendance\*': mid-week match
- '\####': current week's matches

in the first week of divisional play, **grape_rape** topped the first division while **hewhoamareismyself** put up the best overall score. check the results link above to see the effects of promotion and relegation!

due to the large number of participants this week, a new sixth division was formed with those relegated from the fifth division and the best open division players who were not promoted. as always, new players are welcome to join. they will start in the open division and need to work their way up the divisions!

as a reminder, if you did not participate last week or if you are in the first division, then you must participate this week or you will be automatically relegated! if you haven't participated in either of the last two weeks then you must participate this week or you will be completely removed from the league! all others will receive one grace week if they do not participate.

good luck with week 4!",Yalay,mls

at yesterday’s match during the first half the quakes were up 1-0 and about 10-15 gsu in their black windbreakers ambushed our away supporters section and stole one of flags someone had brought from san jose. they all split up and obviously sprinted back to the other side of the stadium. during the half time as i left the bathroom the same group of gsu were sprinting down the stairs with my 7 foot banner that i had spent over six hours painting overnight. the fact that i only get to see the quakes play twice every other year in nyc means that i had been looking forward to watching them play for a long time. after fighting with a gsu member on the concourse to get my banner back and deal with police i couldn’t believe how pathetic it was for a supporters shield new york red bull’s garden state ultra to think it’s cool to steal banners from a team that is in no way threatening to them. i got the sense that these guys are just wanna be tough hardcore kids who are the laughing stock of red bull’s fans and mls supporters groups. 
also, we didn’t have security at all during the first half with our 20 supporters. it took this incident to have security which is disappoint for a group of people who simply wanted to watch their team hopefully play a good game. i think stadiums should have more security and either strictly watch or ban groups who do things like this. this kind of hooligan support adds nothing positive to soccer and seems simply pathetic. anyone else experience something like this?",QuakesNYC,mls

535,/r/mls survivor: round seven results,"another fairly-split round, though the loser this time established themselves fairly early on and held out comfortably against other contenders for the ""get the hell off my island"" award. the top four appear to be fairly consistent vote-getters, who i'd expect to remain there for the foreseeable future, but who knows!

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the second team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 300 votes is...

**new york city fc**

that was a close one, look at this top five!:

* new york city fc - 85 votes (28.3%)
* seattle sounders fc - 57 votes (19.0%)
* columbus crew - 47 votes (15.7%)
* portland timbers - 36 votes (12.0%)
* toronto fc - 15 (5.0%)

[here's a look at the full voting results](https://imgur.com/a/pqjcooh)

check back in tomorrow morning for round seven's voting thread! 18 clubs remain!

###triviality

**[](/atl) atlanta united:** josef martinez has scored 5 of the 10 goals that atlanta has scored against philadelphia... but who scored united's first goal against the union? *(first answered correct by /u/jbainatl - yamil asad, who did so in 2017 in chester; atlanta and philly would draw that game 2-2 - the only game of the four that atlanta hasn't won.)*

**[](/phi) philadelphia union:** when borek dockal broke the union's record for assists in a season, whose record did he break? *(first answered correct by /u/gautam0826 - cristian maidana held the record with 14 assists in 2015.)*

**[](/mls) neutral:** who holds the mls record for most assists in a season? *(first answered correct by /u/gautam0826 - carlos valderrama, in 2000 with the tampa bay mutiny, had an amazing 26 assists.)*
***

###first half

1' - [](/whistle) and this one's underway!

2' - early corners for each team but neither is particularly threatening.

4' - creavalle all alone in the box for a second there but can't get the shot off!

7' - the union attack is looking like a night fury, which is to say, toothless.

9' - trusty and wagner seem to get confused a bit and atlanta can't make them pay for it.

11' - creavalle is down after trying to head the ball over gressel; fortunately the microphones aren't in a position to pick up what bedoya had to say there.

14' - bedoya takes down pirez, giving atlanta a free kick in an advanced position; but then a bedoya header keeps the ensuing free kick away from the net.

16' - bedoya in on goal but the linesman has given him offside.

18' - jp dellacamera just had to apologize for the ""rather detailed audio"" from the atlanta supporters section.

19' - villalba sends it into the box but blake gets his hands on it!

21' - aaronson almost had his first mls goal there; then burke's boot catches guzan and the 'keeper is down.

25' - martinez almost got a gift there from wagner, but elliott is able to clear!

26' - this op wants to give a yellow card to phl17's production crew for that goldbergs ad. at least we don't have to hear about sitting down in one's underwear anymore.

30' - atlanta with a corner kick, but it goes nowhere.

32' - tommy smyth claiming the union need to take more shots. i fail to see how jameson's is going to help here.

34' - beautiful cross in to burke, but he shows he's taken lessons from the roberto baggio school of finishing and skies it over the crossbar.

36' - villalba's shot is low and wide!

37' - woodwork as josef martinez rattles the crossbar; and now martinez is down.

40' - picault rounds the keeper and puts it on net but miles robinson clears it away!

45'+1 - somehow we have only three minutes of stoppage time.

45'+2 - burke's down again after clattering with gonzalez pirez.

45'+5 - and that's the end of the first half; we're scoreless in atlanta.

###second half

ht: [](/sub) jones in for creavalle to start the half as philly makes their first sub.

46' - and here we go with the second half!

47' - **[](/goal) goal, philadelphia!** brenden aaronson bulges the auld onion bag from about 25 yards out to score in his debut!

49' - medunjanin takes the free kick in an advanced position but bedoya can't do anything with it.

51' - gressel sends it in but blake is ready for it!

53' - [](/yellow) haris medunjanin takes down nagbe and earns himself a booking. hopefully he's quieter than the last time he was here.

54' - ensuing free kick is dealt well by blake.

56' - wagner takes a shot but it's wide of the net!

58' - josef martinez slips in on goal but he puts the shot wide!

59' - [](/sub) shea on, giving parkhurst a brek-sit for atlanta's first sub.

63' - aaronson flicks it on but guzan gets to it before picault can!

64' - josef martinez wants to ride his bicycle but blake makes the save!

65' - pity martinez down after what looks like a head to head collision.

68' - burke down again; i fear they may have to substitute for him. meanwhile, [](/sub) barco comes on for villalba for atlanta's second sub.

70' - **[](/goal) goal, atlanta!** gressel crosses it in and barco heads it past blake to level the match!

85' - wagner is down on the foul, but the union will have a free kick...

87' - picault with the shot but saved by guzan! the ensuing shot by ilsinho is high!

89' - [](/sub) accam in for picault as the union make their last sub.

90'+1 - four minutes to go!

90'+2 - atlanta looking for a stoppage-time winner but just can't find one.

90'+3 - [](/yellow) gonzalez pirez takes down burke and got booked for it. free kick upcoming for the union.

90'+4 - medunjanin just puts it high of net!

**1' [](/whistle)start of fist half**

**5'** free kick drops in the box, bounces around, but [](/ner)knighton drops on it.

**6'** wide for [](/tfc)morrow, his cross in finds [](/tfc)deleon, his header is over the crossbar.

**8'** penalty!  hard tackle from behind by [](/tfc)mavinga to take down [](/ner)bunbury, and it's obvious for a spot kick.

**9' [](/goal)goal!!!**  the new man, [](/ner)gil, buries the pk! **[](/tfc)toronto fc 0-1 [](/ner)new england revolution**

**14' [](/goal)goal!!!** the ball gets to the feet of [](/tfc)akinola, he beats three revs defenders, cuts it into the middle of the penalty area, and puts a curler out of the reach of [](/tfc)knighton! **[](/tfc)toronto fc 1-1 [](/ner)new england revolution**

**19'** another chance for a cross by [](/tfc)morrow, but [](/tfc)deleon scuffs the shot wide.

**21'** toward the right side of the box, [](/ner)teal rips a shot, but it curls over the crossbar.

**28'** good ball in to [](/tfc)hamilton[](/offside), but [](/ner)knighton off his line quickly to grab it.  offside flag is up anyway.

**36'** curler by [](/ner)gil from outside the corner of the box is batted down by [](/tfc)bono and cleared.

**40'** center of the box, shot by [](/tfc)deleon is blocked by [](/ner)mancienne.

**45' [](/goal)goal!!!** goal?  flag goes up, comes back down, cross is sent in by [](/tfc)chapman, comes right to [](/tfc)hamilton, wide open, and he has a really easy finish.  **[](/tfc)toronto fc 2-1 [](/ner)new england revolution**

**45'+2** yellow card to [](/ner)gil[](/yellow) for dissent after the goal.

**45'+2 [](/whistle)half time [](/tfc)toronto fc 2-1 [](/ner)new england revolution**

****

brad friedel is gonna get fined.

****

**46' [](/whistle)start of second half**

**49'** persistent infringement yellow card to [](/ner)delamea[](/yellow)

**50'** star of the show, [](/whistle)ted unkel, brings the play back and books [](/tfc)bradley[](/yellow) for taking the free kick too soon.  they get a second chance at a free kick that was wasted.  it's wasted again.

**53' [](/goal)goal!!!**  ball across the box is poorly defended, falls for [](/ner)carles gil, his low, slow shot is deflected and leaves everyone frozen as it rolls into the net! **[](/tfc)toronto fc 2-2 [](/ner)new england revolution**

**58'** [](/tfc)ciman[](/sub-on) replaces chapman[](/sub-off) and brad feldman has a worse accent than all of monty python.

**59'** cross in to [](/tfc)auro, his header is on frame but blocked by [](/ner)castillo.

**60'** now [](/ner)zahibo[](/yellow) picks up a booking for a foul near the touch line.

**62'** play is stopped as [](/ner)mancienne[](/injury) is down after catching the punch away by [](/ner)knighton.

**64'** [](/ner)mancienne is back on the field.

**65'** shot by [](/tfc)deleon is not particularly threatening and is off target.

**68'** [](/tfc)altidore[](/sub-on) returns from injury as hamilton[](/sub-off) takes a seat.

**70'** first revs sub as [](/ner)fagundez[](/sub-off) is replaced by agudelo[](/sub-on)

**72'** header from [](/tfc)morrow is well off target.

**75'** free kick touched wide to [](/tfc)osorio, he rips a shot, but [](/ner)caldwell throws his body in front of it!

**79'** booking for [](/tfc)akinola[](/yellow) for delaying the restart.

**80' [](/goal)goal!!!** a nice ball by [](/tfc)bradley to get [](/tfc)morrow out wide, the revs decide not to defend [](/tfc)altidore, which is where the cross goes, and it's an easy finish. **[](/tfc)toronto fc 3-2 [](/ner)new england revolution**

**84'** two revs subs as [](/ner)caldwell[](/sub-off) and caicedo[](/sub-off) make way for penilla[](/sub-on) and caicedo[](/sub-on)

**86'** free kick by [](/ner)penilla finds the head of [](/ner)bye, but it's completely mishit.

**86'** final sub of the evening is [](/tfc)boyd[](/sub-on) for akindola[](/sub-off) who got that gordie howe hat trick.

**90'+6 full time [](/tfc)toronto fc 3-2 [](/ner)new england revolution**

570,/r/mls survivor: round seven vote,"after lafc was eliminated in round six, hopefully they'll face the same fate in today's match against nycfc. meanwhile, in the *real* competition, there are 18 teams remaining in /r/mls survivor and today's vote will drop that number by one more. it's become a bit of a free for all, so let's see who's out of luck today!

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

[**vote to eliminate a team here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlscprsokma1okw-z1ar8euqrbw0msabwqk887wok0stun_wszq/viewform?usp=sf_link)

*google account required to participate, one response per user*

polls will close at 9 a.m. et tomorrow and results will be posted shortly afterwards.

626,/r/mls survivor: round six results,"okay so i was home sick from work yesterday and i've been swamped catching up today, but here we is! this was really one of the first true interesting rounds of the whole mls survivor event, with no clear cut villain to vote out and no true target of ire for the general public. as a result, we had the most widely contested round, with several teams in the vicinity of being eliminated. ultimately though, only one team leaves the island today!

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the second team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 630 votes is...

**los angeles fc**

that was a close one, look at this top five!:

* los angeles fc - 125 votes (19.8%)
* seattle sounders fc - 117 votes (18.6%)
* columbus crew - 116 votes (18.4%)
* new york city fc - 95 votes (15.1%)
* fc cincinnati - 45 (7.1%)

[here's a look at the full voting results](https://imgur.com/a/9jaupva)

check back in tomorrow morning for round seven's voting thread! 18 clubs remain!

per request, [here's a link to the cumulative vote totals table.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xgzrja06laqmzfgmjanh-hhoswwano9pdg6_b2i7pe/edit?usp=sharing)

surprisingly, tim weah missed the cut, but i suspect many people chose not to vote for him because they’d prefer him to play with the senior team. the same thing limited the number of votes adam received. sargent and amon seemed unaffected by their senior team experience, however.

703,ebobisse future in usmnt? [oc],"hey r/mls,

i’ve recently taken an interest in american youth players in the league, especially because i believe they are still underappreciated on a global and even national level (see most recent us roster). i’m trying my hand on writing summaries on players that i think have great potential, and would love feedback on my analysis, writing technique or my player selections. i like to throw in links between my writing to back up what i’m writing and add a visual aspect. would love to continue learning and start building the hype that these guys deserve. 

thanks! i appreciate any feedback. 

check out my first try below: 


already on gregg berhalter’s radar after earning a call up to january camp, jeremy ebobisse finished nicely with a diving header this week, scoring the only goal in portland’s 4-1 loss to lafc. although his performance might not have saved the timbers, ebobisse possesses excellent finishing technique, usually using his speed and finesse to put the ball in the net. he has a classic striker’s instinct by finding himself in good attacking positions to finish off crosses as well. jeremy can score with his left, right and head. 

see jeremy’s diving header here: 
https://twitter.com/mls/status/1104900709944709120

ebobisse currently plays as a central striker for the timbers, feeding off of balls from star playmaker diego valeri. the two link up quite well, notably during the timbers knockout round victory against fc dallas last season. ebobisse out sprinted his marking center back, drew the keeper out and turned to play the ball back for valeri to finish. a controlled move from a young player, as portland was away from home and down to 10 men in this playoff match. 

ebobisse also seems to have a level head on his shoulders. he mentions that he recognizes the privilege that he has to play professionally and highlights his personal drive to perform. if he continues to get minutes and finds consistency - jeremy can become a real alternative for the usmnt’s front line. 

a fun fact about ebobisse, before playing for duke, he played alongside sporting kansas city’s new signing gedion zelalem while in high school.

| rank | team  | record | movement| blurb |
|:-----------|:------------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
1|[](/lafc) los angeles fc|2-0-0|0|lafc overwhelmed mls cup runners-up, the portland timbers, after a shaky opening 20 minutes where the match looked evenly split.  lafc grabbed a vital 2-1 lead on the stroke of half-time to go into the locker room up 2-1.  an inspired performance from the black and gold saw adama diomande tap in a carlos vela cross, before setting up vela for a scintillating trademark finesse finish from his left foot.  portland's frustration grew at 4-1 and chara's second yellow put lafc into the driver's seat for the last 20 minutes.  vela, dio, rossi, atuesta, nguyen, kaye and zimmerman were superb on the day.  blessing filled in admirably for beita at rb following a cautionary concussion substitution - blessed with pace and an eye to get forward.  segura, partnering zimmerman at cb, looked 1/2 step behind and benefiited from being a player up after 70 minutes.  vassell subbed into midfield for kaya, but made little impression.    lafc head to nyfc in good spirits and should be aiming for a positive result on the narrow field of yankee stadium.  this team will be tested with 3 away games over the course of 4 upcoming matches to see just how good they are after dispatching both skc and portland timbers at home.|
2|[](/sea) seattle sounders fc|2-0-0|+2|2 very early goals were enough to secure a 2-0 victory in a very chippy match against colorado, with frei getting the clean sheet despite colorado's effort. with the offensive weapons, the solid defensive play, and excellent goaltending from frei, the sounders have already made a strong statement to start off this season. if all continues to go well, the sounders are poised to make an excellent run at the mls cup. next up, the sounders face the chicago fire in their first away match of the campagin.|
3|[](/skc) sporting kansas city|1-1-0|+2|*no ranking submitted*|
4|[](/dcu) d.c. united|1-0-1|0|game review presented by flosports: ...|
5|[](/nyrb) new york red bulls|0-0-1|-3|quite a week for the red bulls, dropping no points on a bye.  the team is salivating at the chance to host san jose in the home opener this week.  with the joining of mathis jorgenesen and the hopeful return of kemar lawrence, the team is set to be at full strength.|
6|[](/clb) columbus crew sc|1-0-1|+3|ugly win on the road in new england. zach steffen shows once again how much of a beast he is between the pipes. get freaking stuffed! still not playing super connected as a team but getting the ball to zardes in front of the goal seems like a good option for the time being. very winnable stretch coming up for the crew and they need to take advantage of this before the summer transfer window.|
7|[](/min) minnesota united fc|2-0-0|**+7**|who is this team and what did they do with the loons we know? now, granted, the two teams minnesota beat are currently bottom dwellers in the league, but road wins are not exactly something united are known for, let alone away game shutouts. if they can keep this going and keep everyone healthy, this team could be quite good this year. but minnesota fans would be wise to temper their excitement and see how the rest of this roadtrip shakes out before dreaming of playoffs.|
8|[](/atl) atlanta united fc|0-1-1|-2|atlanta united is off to a rough start, with only 1 goal scored and 3 goals allowed in it’s first 2 mls games.  how much of the performance is related to a new system, new coach and a busy schedule with champions league is still to be seen.  however, the team has played 5 games in 17 days and it is hard to believe that has not taken a toll.|
9|[](/dal) fc dallas|1-0-1|+3|start pomykal. good things happen. the kid was all over place in a man of the match performance. in fact the entire midfield looked stellar. the only thing keeping fcd from top tier status is the front 3 now.|
10|[](/nyc) new york fc|0-0-2|0|johnson and hamid both came up big. sands got the start again and looked great. mitri showed flashes of brilliance. still need a striker.|
11|[](/por) portland timbers|0-1-1|-4|up against one of the west's finest, the timbers looked like they'd be embarrassing even in the eastern conference. defensive issues abound, and it's still unclear how this squad is supposed to play any kind of formation that doesn't look like the christmas tree. it's still early in the season, but giving up seven goals in two games doesn't inspire a ton of confidence. |
12|[](/lag) la galaxy|1-1-0|-4|week 2 was a case of everything that could go wrong, did.  going into the season with a new coach and a thin roster, the galaxy neededd the breaks to go thier way if they were to contend.  buyt that did not happen in week 2. losing 2 of their 3 dps (maybe they should have kept all 4) and not having signed a scorer to replace kamara left the team with no real scoring threat.  the team also looks like they are still unsure about the new systems put in this year.  add to that giving up 2 gifted goals in 2 games by their new defensive signing, and this team looks to be in real trouble.  however zlatan could return next week, score 5 goals and all will be well.|
13|[](/hou) houston dynamo|1-0-1|+2|the dynabros earned their first league win of the season after beating montreal impact 2-1. memo scored a goddamn thunderbastard while manotas recorded his 50th goal for the club in all competitions in the process. memo has been flourishing over time at the direction of wilmer cabrera and i hope that the homegrown keeps earning good minutes and provides more of that clutch. but the anus clench rolls in once again as we visit monterrey for judgement day and host vancouver this weekend.|
14|[](/tfc) toronto fc|1-0-0|-2|toronto fc had the week off and it's been uneventful for tfc fans. however, the home opener at bmo field is next sunday and tfc look foward to taking on the new england revolution.|
15|[](/rsl) real salt lake|1-0-1|+1|a win is a win, no matter how it comes about.  refs will make mistakes, some will inevitably go against rsl in future games so fans aren't going to care much about this one.  (plus, it kind of makes up for the terrible handball / pk call against borchers back in '13 - karma baby!).|
16|[](/mtl) montreal impact|1-1-0|**-5**|*no ranking submitted*|
17|[](/orl) orlando city sc|0-0-2|+2|a boring first half of soccer for both teams was followed by a quick start to the second half with dwyer chipping chicago’s keeper with an over-the-top ball from nani. from there, things started to open up for orlando as they looked to double their lead and solidify their defense for a clean sheet. the purple lions looked on their way to an away victory and a clean-sheet as they went up a man in the 64th minute. of course in what almost seems like typical orlando city fashion, they conceded an equalizer as stoppage time expired to only walk away with a single point. fans were in debate over whether mueller should have dribbled to the corner instead of crossing to dwyer which allowed for the final attack from the fire, the poor defense that let that final header in on goal, and rowe’s goalkeeping. orlando city continued to reinforce its backline with the signing of swedish center back, robin jansson, and will return home to face the impact de montréal this saturday. |
18|[](/chi) chicago fire|0-1-1|+3|lol for anyone that turned off their tv too early. while only getting one point out of the game, the whole game felt like we deserved all 3 with one blaring exception: the damn defense. seriously something has to change, clearly. with cj being that good that quick, along with katai and niko, this team will score goals but it won't matter if we let trash goals get through like what happened this week. also shout out to the new supporters section, it looked and sounded awesome|
19|[](/col) colorado rapids|0-1-1|-2|i watched eighty minutes of soccer, and saw the rapids get a shutout! unfortunately, in the previous ten minutes that started the game, the sounders bagged two goals. nobody was expecting a road win in seattle, but can the rapids lose like a normal team for once on a 55th minute goal 1-0? things don't get any easier with kansas city arriving in denver, maybe we can get a point or something because they're wrapped up in ccl fever.|
20|[](/phi) philadelphia union|0-2-0|-2|the good: the union brought in jamiro monteiro, who should function as a shuttler opposite bedoya in the diamond. i'm cautiously optimistic that he will help, but i don't think he's going to be anywhere near a game changer. also, new signing kai wagner looked good on sunday. the bad: the union lost 2-0 to an a- sporting kc team. this wasn't quite skc's top lineup, as teenager gianluca busio came in for roger espinoza and hungarian international botond barath was in for the injured andreu fontas, but it was pretty darn close. while ideally, we could've gotten a point, losing to them on the road was not shocking. jack elliot scored with a nice sliding finish on a dangerous cross, but unfortunately it was on the wrong net. the ugly: marco fabian's 1 saved pk and 1 red card performance. dishonorable mentions go to the union's finishing, which was better on defense than on offense, and whatever is left of ray gaddis after he got eaten alive by johnny russell|
21|[](/ner) new england revolution|0-1-1|-1|outpossessed and outplayed at home.  going on the road to a well rested toronto team.  i'm going to attempt to reserve judgement over our whole season until after the cincinnati game, but so far....it ain't good.  hopefully tfc players go to a real rager next saturday night.  the revs need all the help they can get.|
22|[](/cin) fc cincinnati|0-1-1|+2|*no ranking submitted*|
23|[](/van)vancouver whitecaps fc|0-2-0|-1|well whaddya know, the whitecaps once again get victimized by bad officiating. this time it only took 2 games into the season instead of 3. it's just infuriating when the ref calls a penalty on a dive and even more so when the var does jack to contest that poor decision. other than that, the game was fine. the defense held on to what should have been a clean sheet and in-beom was clinical. on the downside, montero was so ineffective that the whitecaps might as well have been playing a man down. that is not what you want from your dp striker. hopefully he's just in a funk and breaks out soon. additionally, the whitecaps have solved their lb woes by signing one... to a 3 month loan. weird flex but okay.|

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

735,unmasking flosports: mls's new mysterious streaming partner,"**the flosports problem**

i’m as surprised as many of you of how quickly flosports has taken over the north american soccer circle. first, it began as the exclusive local partner of d.c. united, which was surprising given that [the far more accessible nbc sports washington was offering to broadcast d.c. united games](https://awfulannouncing.com/soccer/d-c-united-shucking-traditional-local-tv-deal-will-instead-stream-games-through-flosports.html)(though probably with a less lucrative deal, given that d.c. united are not as popular as say, the nfl team in washington, the capitals, nationals, and probably on par with the wizards). then, flosports managed to win the bidding rights to broadcast all non-usmnt/mexico concacaf nations league games in the united states in english. finally, after their botched debut with d.c. united, they managed to win *yet another* contract, this time fc cincinnati, acquiring the rights to broadcast fc cincinnati games outside the immediate cincinnati area. as bad as a reputation flosports may have already, there’s no sign they are losing momentum. who knows what they might get their hands on next; concacaf champions league, the nwsl, youth concacaf tournaments, other mls contracts, and perhaps the holy grail of being part of the 2022 mls tv deal, which mls has stressed teams to *not* extend their local tv deals past 2022.

**what’s the big issue?**

as the weekend has already shown us, flosports did not have a stellar debut to mls, [with their first broadcast suffering from numerous problems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/10/dc-uniteds-new-streaming-partnership-gets-off-rough-start/?utm_term=.82ee22d60a38). from what i can gauge, flosports does not have the greatest reputation with its usual clients of softball, cheerleading, and rodeo. from my first impression, flosports does not look like they would be in the business of broadcasting high-level professional soccer.

however, we must look at the greater implications. flosports charges ridiculous fees compared to other broadcasting services; espn+ is only 5 dollars a month with far better content, and while youtube tv costs 40 dollars a month, it provides far more content and is a better service. it’s not even worth the value; while i don’t want to make accusations, from the outside it seems flo’s business model is overcharging for marquee events that otherwise wouldn’t have a broadcast partner, and catering to niche markets. of course, they’re able to get away with providing subpar service to these markets because those fallen trees will not make much noise. this time, they may have gone too far; they’re messing with fans of the highest level of soccer in the united states, and those shortcomings will be under a bigger spotlight.

this should concern any mls fan. while the mls has stabilized and has become profitable, perhaps entrenching itself as america’s fifth league, it still isn’t at the point where it can challenge the nhl or mlb, and its growth is rather precious. the idea of the league switching away from conventional broadcasts to paid streaming will make games less accessible and have far less outreach. this could alienate casual and new fans, and create a “gatekeeper” mentality that mls is *not* like the other american leagues.

anyway, that was quite a lot i had to say. but let’s get to the meat: *what the hell is flosports?*

**finding out flosports**

flosports is obscure enough to not even have a wikipedia page, but i was able to get a good amount of information, giving a lot more needed context into this rather mysterious company.

flosports was [founded in 2006](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201710/tom-foster/flosports.html)in ***austin, texas*** by martin floerani in 2006. to put it lightly, the concept of the company came when floerani thought that niche sports deserved coverage akin to world’s most popular sports, and what flosports wants to become (at some point) is the espn of sports streaming. i even managed to get some hard numbers; flosports is adding roughly ***30,000 subscribers each month at a rate of $150 a year***. for a start-up, that’s quite impressive. some financial numbers show that in 2016, investors poured ***$21 million***, when in 2012, the company only brought in a revenue of ***$1 million***. again, that’s impressive, especially in four years. i’m not going to regurgitate every factoid from this article, i suggest you read it yourself and form your own opinions, because the things said in it are *interesting*, and give a lot of insight onto the company and its mentality.

judging from those numbers, flosports is growing and will probably continue to increase its subscriber base. the mls seems to fetishize streaming, and flosports *appears* to be a potential ideal partner. in another 3 more years, flosports might be groomed and ready to take exclusive online streaming rights from say, espn+. flosports is going for a big move in bringing soccer onto its programming, which will only accelerate its growth.

**shoddy service**

here comes another big question: what about the service? well, unfortunately, it does *not* look good.

flosports has a [whopping 135 complaints from the better business bureau (bbb)](https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/austin/profile/digital-media/flosports-inc-0825-1000108975/complaints). that is not a good look. most complaints concern misleading statements about charges; many customers thought they’d only pay $12 per month for a specific sport, but were instead immediately charged $150.00, and even being charged before reading the terms and conditions.

i wanted to get a look on the inside, [viewing the company’s reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/reviews/flosports-reviews-e814301.htm)on **glassdoor**. while glassdoor is user-reviewed and certainly not all the gossip can be true, flosports holds a 3.2 out of 5 stars, with some rather unflattering things said about them by former and current employees. this includes statements about business practices, company culture, and work load. perhaps the most damning review said this:

&gt;*my advice will fall on deaf ears, and its definitely not useful now that you let go, or have lost your best talent.... you should never have given up on creating great content. i think going all-in on live events is a mistake, and you are going to hit a major road block when you actually go up against the big boys…*

another review stated:

&gt;*forget about scale. you already failed miserably trying that. you're not espn. never going to be even a pimple on their butt. return the cash to the vc's. concentrate on sports you can win at. you'll have a nice little profitable company without vc's who want scale above all interfering. meanwhile these vcs don't know the marketplace*

i don’t work at flosports, so i cannot comment on their internal politics, but this is pretty damning, and this is publicly available for free.

there is more reason to believe that internal strife is occurring in the company. [the head honcho himself was forced out of the company](https://intermatwrestle.com/articles/19697)in february 2018 over a lawsuit with the world wrestling network. the whole thing is quite surreal and reads almost like a satire of start-ups.

finally, what about the service itself? [from the apple app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flosports-watch-live-sports/id1149210891?mt=8)store, flosports holds a **3.2 rating out of 5**. compare this to espn+ on the same site which holds a 4.5 rating out of 5. the nfl app holds a 4.7 rating out of 5. by sports streaming standards, flosports is a lousy service compared to the alternatives and judging from some of the nasty stuff read on glassdoor, it can be easy to infer that the issues with the service may be in part due to internal strife. one review states:

&gt;*i purchased a subscription for this app to be able to view videos and other content. my money was immediately taken out of my account but every time i try to view anything it says that i need to purchase a subscription. i have contacted their customer service several times now and they tell me that they can’t find any information or my subscription and did i maybe use another email. i have sent them screenshots of the purchase and my account information with them showing them that they information is in fact correct, then i receive no further communication. trying to receive information or a refund through apple is proving to be just as difficult and unsuccessful. do yourself a favor and don’t bother wasting your money. cause you’ll get nothing for it but silence and a headache.*

using pirate streams from shady sites is likely to provide you better service than flosports, which is supposed to be a licensed vendor.

from what i have been able to uncover, flosports does not have the best reputation with its customers, has some unflattering reviews about it on the web, and its service is inferior to that of its competitors. for a company that is trying to challenge espn, this doesn’t paint a great picture.

**the austin connection?**

i apologize, but there is one thing i find incredibly suspicious about flosports becoming an mls broadcast partner: it’s located in austin, texas. mls’s love for the city of austin is well documented, doing everything it could in its power to move the columbus crew to that city under the order of anthony precourt. it did not work out exactly as expected, but mls got its team in austin, and precourt will be the owner.

i can’t help but think that perhaps flosports played a role in that soap opera, but that is all speculation. i could not find any link between anthony precourt, precourt sports ventures, and flosports, so i’m not going to dive down that rabbit hole too deeply. however, i do expect flosports to be favorites to land a broadcasting deal with austin fc if their momentum continues, since they are an austin-based company. i also speculate whether flosports have had private conversations of carrying austin fc games perhaps as early as 2017. their sudden momentum makes this all suspicious. however, the earliest soccer broadcast flosports had [dates to august 2018](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2018/08/14/flosports-lands-lands-u-s-streaming-rights-to-soccer-legend-bastian-schweinsteigers-final-match/)in an exhibition match between the chicago fire and bayern munich.

**conclusion**

there has been a lot of skepticism with flosports on the mls community, and i believe that the community should be alarmed.

flosports has a history of questionable business practices that border on anti-consumer, internal strife, poor quality, and making its broadcasts difficult to access, with their acquisitions often being described as ‘holding sports hostage’. in an ideal world, mls gets its games broadcasted on the best possible service that reaches the most people, and i do not see that with flosports.

soccer has come a long way in the united states, and as an outsider, i want to see the sport continue to grow in the us because it is a great sport. it should be for everyone, and every fan should have a right to watch their team. to me, this stinks of gatekeeping; it’s the broadcast equivalent of pay-to-play. what about fans who cannot spend on the service? sports teams have a history of uniting cities regardless of class, race, ethnicity, etc. and this could damage the mls’s credibility and give it the image of an ‘elitist league’.

if mls teams are really struggling to the point where they must turn to flosports, they really need to look at themselves in terms of bringing in more fans and viewers. however, all i see are a ton of red flags with flosports, and the mls fandom should act on it before this becomes the norm.",Return_Of_BG_97,mls

774,/r/mls survivor: round five results,"atlanta united may be dead and gone, but their cold, zombie corpse continues to vote and they spent their first round on the sidelines seeking revenge. the vote tally dropped this round, which we'll chalk it up to a busy monday, the skipped day on sunday, and the silence of thousands of atl fans still reeling from the tactical masterclass that was fdb leading his defending champions to a draw with fc cincy at home. let's get down to business:

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the second team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 394 votes is...

**d.c. united**

i mean, it came after they themselves were eliminated, but atl finally got their self-declared justice on dcu:

* d.c. united - 164 votes (41.6%)
* los angeles fc - 54 votes (13.7%)
* portland timbers - 38 votes (9.6%)
* seattle sounders fc - 37 votes (9.4%)
* new york city fc - 20 (5.1%)

[here's a look at the full voting results](https://imgur.com/a/p232w9i)

check back in tomorrow morning for round four's voting thread! 19 clubs remain!

**edit**:

for all of you armchair english-majors taking issue with ""variable cornucopia,"" let me give you a basic lesson in semantics. the *only* way that a phrase can be semantically incorrect is if the given adjective **cannot** logically describe the given noun. beyond this extremely narrow definition, there is no such thing as a semantically incorrect phrase. it does not have to be orthodox, and it does not have to be colloquially common. it only needs to be logical. ""variable"" is an adjective describing something without discernable or predictable pattern. ""cornucopia"" is a vast abundance. thus, a ""variable cornucopia"" is an abundance of something, the contents of which cannot be described by a single pattern. this was *precisely* what i was trying to communicate: i saw an abundance of soccer jerseys, from an unpredictable degree and breadth of sources. jesus, you guys can be such dicks sometimes.",JakefromHell,mls

huge congratulations to **extramen1066** who had the top score overall for the second consecutive week!

based on the aggregate results of the first two weeks, players have been seeded into five divisions for week 3. joining extramen1066 in the first division are the other nine players who had the best aggregate scores. the 11th-20th best will make up the second division, and so on. check out the results link to see how you did! starting this week, the best two players in each division will be promoted while the worst two will be relegated.

the 51st-56th aggregate scorers will make up the open division where they will be joined by any new players. the best open division players will be promoted to the fifth division and, if there are enough players, then the top 10 will form a new sixth division.

as a reminder, if you did not participate in week 2 or if you are in the first division, then you must participate this week or you will automatically be relegated! all others will receive one grace week if they do not participate.

best of luck to all in week 3!",Yalay,mls

825,weekly match rating thread,"hi all,

hoping to get a general feel if people would be interested in weekly match ratings threads, where users can rate and comments on each match (with no score/event spoilers) from the previous week. this would help users who are looking to watch replays midweek and don’t want to spend time watching uninteresting games. 

i’m thinking i would post the thread monday mornings starting next week and give each game a comment, where people could then leave their match ratings (1-10, comment about the game). 

if people are interested in participating, i’m open to give it a try! also open to any suggestions to make the threads better.

notes: 

- row numbers are *home games*, not *week numbers*. only mls league games are tracked.
- numbers aren't people passing through the gates. attendance numbers are reported by teams, and most teams report tickets sold.
- capacities are defined by teams, not by the number of seats in venues. (this helps account for teams in nfl-compatible stadiums, while applying a consistent standard.)
- ***hicap***: games played in larger-than-normal venues. (once played, displayed as [***attendance***].)
- **bold**: sellout (of regular capacity)
- 'attendance\*': mid-week match
- '\####': current week's matches

832,2019 nor'easter gauntlet (3/11/19 update)," sunday's match between nycfc and dc united was one of those games where both teams' goalkeepers made a case that they are underpaid (particularly hamid, though i am admittedly biased) and both offenses failed to capitalize on opportunities. each teams next game, however, is the one rematch they'll have this season, only dc will host. hopefully everyone will have a chip on their shoulder. 

 but that will be over 40 days from now, and right before that the revs and red bulls will get a shot at adding points to the table. 

see you all in april!

  this competition only exists on r/mls, and is something i do purely for fun. it is completely unrelated to any other competition run anywhere else. it is also unrelated to the atlantic cup (nyrb vs dc) or the hudson river derby (nyrb vs nycfc), though all those games count towards the gauntlet table. 

  **regarding public input**: when i update the tables after games, i am quite capable of making mistakes, so letting me know something should be corrected is welcome. one thing i'm not open to is changing the name of the competition. that was dealt with ages ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mls/comments/3o4g59/hypothetical_i95_series_naming_suggestions_welcome/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mls/comments/3pam7m/updated_table_for_dc_philly_nyrb_nycfc_and_revs/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)). there were too many proprietary issues around calling it the acela cup and i-95 cup isn't specific enough. also, and more importantly, i do all the danged work so i get to decide what it's called. done.

835,/r/mls survivor: round five vote,"yes, i know, a day late again. but listen, it's hard driving three hours to do wedding planning and back in a day, so cut me a break. fact. atlanta united got eliminated last round. fact. i have no idea what's going to happen from here on out. fact. i'm super excited to vote watch today. bears. beets. battlestar galactica. let's get it on.

for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll or results thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

[**vote to eliminate a team here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1faipqlseaxuljiymfnrhksga3w1fty2bp2dkzlwzyb6pxtqc-m4_9wa/viewform?usp=sf_link)

*google account required to participate, one response per user*

polls will close at 9 a.m. et tomorrow and results will be posted shortly afterwards.

843,"polls for us u-20, u-23, and women's national team depth charts"," 

hey again, everyone! i took the advice of many people on this sub and edited the polls i’ve been working on. i trimmed down the player pools, gave users the option to select by position or without position restrictions, and created polls for the u-23, u-20, and women’s national teams. i’m posting those polls here to get a baseline and i’ll repeat the polls as the major competitions get closer. i used a 4-3-3 formation for each team to keep things simple but i am aware that the u-20 team often plays in a 4-4-2 so i’m willing to tweak that going forward. 

&amp;#x200b;

u-20 men’s national team:

* the 2019 fifa u-20 world cup will be hosted by poland between **may 23 and june 15**, 2019. after winning the 2018 concacaf u-20 championship, team usa finds themselves in group d alongside qatar, nigeria, and ukraine.
* poll: [https://goo.gl/forms/cyv9vtkxcehlrggz1](https://goo.gl/forms/cyv9vtkxcehlrggz1) 

&amp;#x200b;

women’s national team:

* the 2019 fifa women's world cup will take place in france from **june 7 - july 7**. the defending world cup champions, defending concacaf champions, and #1 ranked uswmt have been drawn in group f with thailand, chile, and sweden, who eliminated team usa in the quarterfinals of the 2016 olympics. the women's national team also qualified for the 2019 pan american games, which will take place in july and august in peru, by winning last year's concacaf championship. unlike on the men's side, the women's pan american games and olympics do not have age restrictions. 
* poll: [https://goo.gl/forms/fobpotmlslcqcfux2](https://goo.gl/forms/fobpotmlslcqcfux2) 

&amp;#x200b;

u-23 (olympic) men’s national team: 

* football at the 2020 olympics will run from july 24 - august 9 in tokyo, japan. qualification for the olympics will begin on **october 3, 2019** during the fifa international window. the 2019 pan american games, a u-22 competition that follows the same age and roster restrictions as the olympics, will run from **july 25 - august 9**, serving as a tune-up tournament exactly one year before the olympics. the concacaf gold cup ends on july 7, 2019, two and a half weeks before the pan american games begin.
* poll: [https://goo.gl/forms/t2kh9rnico2fcbaf2](https://goo.gl/forms/t2kh9rnico2fcbaf2)

###triviality

**[](/skc) sporting kansas city:** who is the only goalkeeper to record a clean sheet for skc against the union in an official match? *(answered first by /u/ravegreener - jimmy nielsen, who actually did it three times - in 2010 and 2011 regular season matches, and in the 2012 open cup semifinal.)*

**[](/phi) philadelphia union:** jay simpson is one of two union players who recorded a brace against skc. who is the other? *(answered first by /u/saltiestmanindaworld - jack mcinerney, who recorded a first half brace in a 4-0 thrashing of sporting in 2012.)*

**[](/mls) neutral:** who holds the mls record for being sent off in their career, having earned ten career red cards? *(answered first by /u/highonramen - jámison olave, who earned 10 sendings-off in his career with rsl and the red bulls.)*

###first half

1' - we've reached the point of know return, it's kickoff in kansas!

2' - burke and zusi get their legs tangled up.

5' - fabian's shot is just a shade wide! goal kick, sporting.

9' - penso has pointed to the spot; looks like trusty pushing his man out of the way. penalty to sporting!

11' - [](/goal) **goal, sporting!** blake guesses correctly, but ilie buries the spot kick to give sporting the 1-0 lead!

14' - union with the first corner of the match with besler's clearance...

15' - fabián gets it in to elliott but he just couldn't get enough of the ball to put it home!

18' - stoppage as burke and gutierrez clatter together; no foul given.

22' - zusi takes down his man just outside the box and earns a [](/yellow) caution for his troubles!

37' - busio gets [](/yellow) booked for kicking the ball away.

39' - union are appealing for a handball off the corner, but penso hasn't given it yet; he's gone off to var-land.

40' - after further review, it's going to be a spot kick after all for the union!

41' - save by melia on the fabian pk to keep the match 1-0! i think this qualifies as a case of ""ball don't lie""...

43' - busio calls for the longshot but blake able to make the save! whew!

45'+1 - two minutes of stoppage time...

45'+1 - a good handful of attempts on the sporting corner but none find the back of the net!

49' - big save by melia there on the burke shot!

56' - gutierrez sends it in and forces a blake save over the crossbar! corner upcoming.

59' - fabian accidentallyonpurpose steps on russell just outside the box; free kick for kc but penso just headed over for var.

62' - off the woodwork by zusi! oh, that was close to 2-0!

65' - union look content to dump the ball out and let kc possess; have they given up?

68' - curtin asking for a second yellow on zusi there and earning himself a one-credit fine for a violation of the verbal morality statute.

71' - nemeth skies it over the bar on the shot; goal kick, philadelphia.

72' - picault to burke in the area but besler sends it out for a corner!  ...medunjanin probably using a few too many moves trying to dribble in.

73' - [](/sub) santos in for picault for philly's first sub.

77' - busio all in on goal but trusty sends it out for a corner!

78' - [](/sub) rowe in for busio for kc's first sub; jones for creavalle for philly's second.

79' - [](/sub) ilsinho in for burke as the last philly sub.

910,"i noticed historical game-by-game data was hard to come by for mls, so i compiled the data","[here is the data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qv9eaqeqtad65osbmxhkmp5ajgmc5myotboja-ox0ge/edit?usp=sharing)

it contains the team, whether the game is home or away (at/ vs.), the opponent, the result, the day of the week, the date, the home score, away score, points, what game of the season it was and in what season it occurs. the data runs from 2011-2018

for how and why i did it, keep reading

i wanted to see if there was a performance penalty for mls teams competing in the ccl, but i couldn't find good weekly results by team in a usable format. 

so using power query in excel, i was able to grab the form table from [mlssoccer.com](https://www.mlssoccer.com/results/2019) for each year going back to 2011 (the first year with 34 games). however, that data needed a ton of work to be presentable and workable.

i then used python to clean and organize the data, which i then copied to the google sheet i linked.

hopefully this will help fellow stat nerds like me prove whatever hairbrained point we're trying to make.

edit: code and tables can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k5lvamupqkuo2xh1yf-lmdndt5iruj-g/view?usp=sharing)

926,/r/mls survivor: round four results,"hey gang! yeah i know it isn't quite 9-10 a.m. et, but it's saturday and i'm sleepy so what are ya gonna do? i did freeze the vote, but went back to sleep, so you get your results now and you'll like it! it finally happened this round, after two narrow survivals and a shellacking of orlando city, atlanta united's zombie horde couldn't quite keep up with the rallying band of fans from other clubs recognizing the rising threat in front of them.

before we get started, for those unfamiliar:

&gt;**how it will work**

&gt;the /r/mls edition of survivor will be functionally identical to the /r/nfl version. each morning a poll thread will be posted between 9-10 a.m. et, asking users to vote out a team. polling will close the following day at the same time and a results thread will be posted indicating which team has been voted out and who remains. it will utilize a blind vote each day to avoid playing based on the current vote totals to add an element of strategy and surprise! **teams will now also be in randomized order to eliminate any potential bias**

&gt;this sequence will continue for 21 rounds until there are three teams remaining, at which point a final round will be held with the winner decided from the three remaining teams.

&gt;**rules**

&gt;it is just a game. keep things civil and respectful and follow all subreddit and reddit-wide rules. this game is not run by the mods and has nothing to do with them, so don't harass them about any of it. i'll accept all suggestions/complaints myself and will run the game. much like survivor, any and all collusion and conspiracies are allowed and encouraged. make and break alliances, form powerful voting blocs, betray your friends. your objective isn't anything other than being the last team standing!

and now your results: the second team eliminated from /r/mls survivor after 1,350 votes (up 100 from round three) is...

**atlanta united fc**

despite a desperate effort mounted by /r/atlantaunited to rally together and finally beat d.c. united in something, it was not to be as the counter-movement overcame the nation's largest vote-botting campaign:

* atlanta united fc - 626 votes (46.4%)
* d.c. united - 561 votes (41.6%)
* seattle sounders fc - 40 votes (3.0%)
* new york city fc - 20 votes (1.5%)
* fc cincinnati - 16 (1.2%)

[here's a look at the full voting results](https://imgur.com/a/glzflia)

check back in tomorrow morning for round four's voting thread! 20 clubs remain!

per request, [here's a link to the cumulative vote totals table.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xgzrja06laqmzfgmjanh-hhoswwano9pdg6_b2i7pe/edit?usp=sharing)
