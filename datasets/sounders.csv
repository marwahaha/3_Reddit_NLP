0,flairs flairs and more flairs,"as part of getting the subreddit cleaned up a bit on the back end i brought in /u/bleakmidwinter to help us in the short term because he has done such a great job running the /r/mls css and flairs. so you will notice some changes have occurred in our flair list and that you'll need to re-select your flair due to this. 

you will see that some of our former flairs are no longer available. i understand that some of you may not be thrilled with that happening, but we weren't able to save all of them because the original files weren't available to us. but all of the kits were made by hand by /u/bleakmidwinter as he was generous enough to spend his free time helping us out. 

these changes will put us in a good position moving forward to then be able to add more flairs to the template. we may even be able to get some of the old ones back, but that will be something we will have to work towards. please make sure if you get a chance to thank /u/bleakmidwinter because these things take plenty of time and he didn't have to do this. 

anyways enjoy you friday/weekend everyone and lets get another win =d

i'm new to the seattle area and was wondering how people felt about going to matches alone. my friends here aren't into soccer so much, but i figured it might be a good way to meet some sounders folk. are there common do's or don't's? what side of the pitch is best for tickets?

1/ where’s the best place to sit to get the best atmosphere? i don’t want to go to a game and sit in silence, i wanna get drunk and sing. 

2/ what are the two teams looking like heading into the new season? will it be a competitive game?

3/ this one is a long shot but any epl fan out there might know that across the uk we have a chant about a moment in a liverpool/chelsea game a few years ago. it’s based on a moment when then liverpool captain steven gerrard gave the ball away to then chelsea striker named demba ba, who then scored and effectively ended liverpool’s title hopes. it’s hugely significant as liverpool haven’t won a league title since the 80s and gerrard was their talisman back then. 

anyway the whole thing was hilarious and the chant still breaks out randomly in stadiums across the country even in games when liverpool aren’t playing. my question is, for anyone familiar with the moment or willing to learn, is there any chance i will be able to get this chant going? it would literally make my year.

160,timbers fan coming in peace for the mls survivor game - alliance talks,"as you might have seen, there's a team-based ""survivor"" game going on in the /r/mls subreddit right now, where one team is voted out every day. i'm not going to link to it because then this strategy talk will show up as a crosspost, but it's not hard to find at all. 

anyway, part of the game is not becoming the biggest threat, since that almost certainly means instant death, and the main crowd would then vote one of us out.

here's what i'm proposing: both the sounders and the timbers have large fanbases and are top-tier mls franchises, and not everyone likes us. that means we are at risk of being voted out. 

so, how about a cease-fire between cascadia teams? we don't push for you, and you don't push for us, and we can work together on booting whoever is the target that day so it's not us.

yes, it seems counter-intuitive at first. but this is for the greater good, and if we don't stick together they could pick us off easily.

can you guys tell me some things about this team (and about the league as it stands) that will help me dip my toes in the water this season? a 4-1 win is a pretty good place for me to start!

i’ve tried purchasing “single match tickets” from the website but when it comes to payment it’s limited to cards registered in us, canada and mexico. are citizens outside of these counties not eligible to buy tickets? can’t see anything on the website, this thread or google so any help appreciated.

so, i figured i’d ask y’all if you had any questions, topics, etc you’d like to see me touch upon?

and because this is a quakes broadcast being used for both teams, yes, it’ll be more “pro quakes” than “pro sounders” but i definitely want to make it a great broadcast for everyone. just don’t be too shocked if i don’t lose my mind when a goal is scored in a preseason game (unless it’s so spectacular that it warrants me going nuts. then i’m all for it). 

i’m also going to try and get my dad, hal ramey,  to stop by the booth to talk a little nasl era. he broadcast the quakes in the 70s and early 80s (and the clash later in mls), and a little history is always fun as well. 

i have always had a great time coming to your hometown and stadium. i love craft beer, coffee and good food, so seattle is an easy sell for me. if any of you are coming down, hit me up, i’d love to say “hello” before or after the match!",TedRamey,ssfc

&amp;#x200b;

before arriving to seattle halfway through the 2018 mls season, the 28-year-old peruvian forward raul ruidiaz was one of the most prolific strikers in mexico’s liga mx for two full seasons. playing for monarcas morelia, ruidiaz scored a staggering 20 goals in the 2016-2017 liga mx campaign and was crowned best striker, top scorer, and mvp during that season. in the 2017-2018 campaign, ruidiaz netted another 20 goals, which cemented him as one of the most consistent strikers in mexico at the time. during those two seasons, only tigres’ andre-pierre gignac had a higher goal production than ruidiaz. due to his natural goal-scoring ability and dynamic style of play on offense, seattle sounders eagerly snatched the peruvian forward during the 2018 summer transfer window. after almost six months in seattle, it seems ruidiaz is on track to conquering the mls in the same way he conquered mexico.

&amp;#x200b;

due to his short stature, ruidiaz does not play as a traditional number 9, and his unique style of play has seen him become successful across teams in south america, mexico, and now the united states. ruidiaz typically drifts away from the penalty area and starts incisive runs from deep. the attacking midfielder on his team then fills the gap left in behind, which causes disarray in the opposition’s back line. ruidiaz’s quick, intelligent runs, coupled with his lethal finishing, allow possession-based teams to capitalize on well-orchestrated team moves, and these qualities have certainly helped the seattle sounders remain as one of the most dominant teams in the mls.

&amp;#x200b;

although there was some concern regarding ruidiaz’s small size for a number 9, the peruvian international was quick to silence any doubters by scoring a goal in his first official start for the sounders. from then on, ruidiaz was key in helping the sounders win nine straight games and finish second in the western conference. throughout the regular season, ruidiaz managed to score 10 goals in 14 appearances for the club, and he finished the season with a .82 ‘goal per 90 min’ ratio. for players featured in 10 games or more during the 2018 season, only zlatan ibrahimovic, josef martinez and adama diomande had a higher goal ratio than ruidiaz. although the peruvian forward has only been in seattle for a few months, his 2018 stats show that he has the ability to lead a dominant mls franchise to great heights.

&amp;#x200b;

in the 2018 postseason, ruidiaz also showed flashes of how instrumental he can be for seattle in critical situations. during seattle’s run in the 2018 playoffs, ruidiaz scored all but one of their goals, showcasing a fantastic ability to finish team moves and lift his team in adverse situations. in the western conference semifinals, ruidiaz scored a brace in the 2nd leg of the tie to force extra time against the portland timbers. his second goal came in stoppage time after hitting a sensational volley from the edge of the box, and although his team failed to advance in penalties, ruidiaz showed players and fans alike that he will be a dangerous weapon for seattle next season.

451,a quick note about the subreddit over the past few days,"hey everyone,

so after seeing the response to the new sponsor i thought it might be a good idea to review a few things about /r/soundersfc. this is obviously a place where we all come to talk about all things sounders fc and myself and the other mods totally understand that. however, with that though we do need to keep to a certain decorum while we're here.

posts have gotten relatively heated, which is fine, but what isn't fine is when that becomes hateful and disrespectful. i'll refer you all do our subreddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/soundersfc/about/rules/) specifically these two parts. 
&gt; -  flame, troll, or attack fans of other teams using cruel or abusive language.

&gt; - use racist, homophobic, misogynistic/misandric, or other hateful speech, even if you're quoting someone else.

choosing to make comments that break these rules will obviously be removed and you will be given a warning but please remember when you're talking here that there's another person on the receiving end of your posts. and just because you won't see how it impacts the person on the other end doesn't make it alright to act in such a way. 
______________________________________________

i would also like to address the ""shitposts"" that have been overwhelming the front page since the announcement of our new sponsor. first i'll point to a specific part in the bad submissions section of the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/soundersfc/about/rules/).

&gt;**duplicates** of items already posted, or links that do not add any new information or perspective on a topic already being discussed. **beating a dead horse.**

i completely understand that there are various opinions on how the sounders choose to operate this team. furthermore i understand that this is reddit and people want to post memes that are funny and topical to what's currently going on. but, it comes to a point where the entire subreddit is filled with memes and that prevents other content from being seen. 

due to this the mod team has been removing many of the ""shitposts"" because they are falling into the category of the rules that i mentioned previously.

moving forward we will try to ensure that there is a balance between content that is substantive versus memes and the like. and if that proves unsuccessful at that point we can look to revisit the rules and see if we can come up with a better way of dealing with what content is appropriate on this sub.

_______________________________________

thanks everyone for being fantastic and a big reason as to why i'm here on this subreddit. let's look forward to another successful year in soundersland and hopefully we finish silly season with some new friends to cheer on from the stands.

[did you know there was a council specific website?](http://soundersalliance.org/)  \- (there is!)  not only can you read things like bylaws and charters you can see who's currently on the council.  you can also nominate yourself if you'd like to join.

(ex: sounders 2.0, sounders 2.5, 3.0, etc.) 

how else would you all divide up our time within mls (clearly we were born in '74)? i figured after sigi (rip) departed that must've signalled sounders 2.0 (or roughly when we went on our streak and won the cup). would today's signing of ozzie be considered sounders 3.0? 

side note: i'm searching for work (it field) right now so i have plenty of free time, so feel free to strike up a conversation or just write down some feelings or memories that we've created over these wonderful years within mls. is there anything you want to see specifically in the near future? any predictions for the 2019 season?

kim kee-hee is nowhere to be spotted on the roster. 

i was somewhat monitoring korean news sources to see any mentions of kim for the past couple of days after the sounders announced he got a call up but, i found it odd that his name was not mentioned at all from various sources. 

and then earlier this morning kfa (korean football association) posted a tweet with the roster for the upcoming friendlies.

additionally, the team seems to already be in australia where their two friendly matches will take place as well.

so it looks like the sounders might've messed up this announcement....?

cheney stadium played host to s2 this year. average attendance of 3,370, up more than doubles last year’s average of 1,097 at starfire. i went to three s2 games this season and the entire experience is much better than prior seasons. bringing the rainiers into the team’s marketing and business strategy seems to be huge success. a soccer specific stadium is in the cards for year 2020.

&amp;#x200b;

**the coach**

john hutchinson was simply spectacular imo. clear improvement from most players on the roster, interesting tactical approaches to each game, integrating the youth into the usl side better than any other mls team, i can not say enough about him. lock him up long-term!

&amp;#x200b;

**the players**

shandon hopeau:

age: 19 years old

stats: 30 gp, 2 goals, 0 assist, led team in chances created: 27

story: the most dangerous player on s2 with ball at his feet. improved physique allowed him to keep the ball and become a better two-way player this year. two footed, and a powerful shot. i see him starting in usl next year, again.

&amp;#x200b;

azriel gonzalez:

age: 17 years old

stats: 18 gp,3 goals(bangers only), 3 assists

story: the most exciting player on s2 for my money. made an adjustment to the physicality of the league and was able to demonstrate great 1v1 attacking skills. combination play and keeping possession were two areas that still need to developed.

&amp;#x200b;

denso ulysse

age: 19

stats: 28 gp, 2 assists, duels won 53%

story: biggest surprise of the year for me. he went from struggling in usl, to collecting second team alll-usl. i think he will compete with jordan mccrary for second-choice rb next year. his defending, timing of runs, and keeping possession made improvements.

&amp;#x200b;

jesse daley

age: 21

stats: 22 gp, 80% pass rate, 3 assists

story: another surprise, the most dependable player in the team for most of the year. played the 6, 8, and 10 effectively, and would be helpful to keep on the s2 roster due to how sporadically available the roster is.

&amp;#x200b;

david estrada

age: 30 (lol)

stats: 33 gp, 11 goals, 2 assists

story: great success story, sounders drafted estrada in 2009 and, while a fan favorite, was traded in 2014, and came back this season to both coach the sounders u-15s and play for s2. the group seemed to look up to him as a role model and if any of the guys can take a quarter of his work ethic, they will be better for it.

&amp;#x200b;

**misfortune w/injuries**

sam rogers: hard season to read, dealt with many injuries and playing with the u-20s, i think he still has a good chance to make the first team next year.

ray saari: released in the middle of the season while dealing with a long-term injury, strange one from both sides. hasn’t signed with a new club yet.

francisco narbon: season ending horror challenge saw his season end early. can’t see him making the first team, not sure if he’ll be back on s2 next year as he’s aging out.

felix chenkam: as soon as he got signed to the first team, consecutive injuries ended his season. let’s see how he recovers.

715,[shitpost] so when fredy montero moves back home during the summer...,"unpopular opinion, but hear me out...

i believe he still wants to continue playing the sport he loves. with the unfortunate events that have happened with his family, he is finishing up over in portugal and supposedly moving back to the pacific northwest and will continue operating his coffee shop and live life with his family. 

*now..*

if he still wants to play soccer, would it be crazy if the sounders reunite with him on a tam contract? i know it's still pretty early to speculate, but if we end up losing a striker (hopefully not bruin, but maybe neagle?) maybe we could benefit from him. just depends on the situation of the team at the time (which would more than likely be summer since the portuguese league doesn't finish until may).

i know this is in other threads to, but who do you guys think is being cut/contracts not renewed? who do you guys want to be signed? (clearly i am still following fredy, so i wouldn't mind him back...for the right price.. but i do hope that his family is doing well.)

742,the sounders have made me love seattle.,"i wasn’t born in seattle, or the us for that matter, and having to hear about the mls get bashed for years on end set such a false perception about seattle.

from watching the mls cup final 2 years ago, and remarking it as one of the worst games i’ve ever seen, then seeing the one last year and laughing it off, i found a spark with the sounders when me and a friend decided to go to the chicago game at home. we even doubled down and went into the ga section because we love a bit of atmosphere. it was a boring 1-1 draw, but i feel in love. instead of watching liverpool on the tv every other week, a club that i only ever supported because my older brother did, i tried my very hardest to go to as many games as possible because i loved how tangible everything was.

i brought irish lads i knew who were over for a few weeks to our 3-1 win over nycfc, the goose was indeed loose for that game, and then when we played dallas. i was in sea-tac, getting ready to board a flight to ireland, and some guy was streaming the seattle game. the flight got delayed and i was able to watch all of the game and chat all things sounders. turned out he was an editor for seattle at heart.  love that.

and now, being at the match tonight, i was able to see how much the team had grown.  i loved every minute of it. scoring in the 93rd minute, only to suffer heartbreak through penalties made me realize how much i’m looking forward to the next season.

however, for now, i’m ready to grab my shovel, and fuel as much transfer rumors and shitposting into this sub. i love each and every player on that field and person in the subreddit.

814,random thoughts: sounders to target glad this winter?,"i have no inside information (from the sounders side, at least), but there are some easy dots to connect here.

&amp;#x200b;

glad has been on the verge of leaving rsl for a couple seasons now. i think the player and club were expecting him to have a big season in 2018 and sell him to a european club this winter/next summer. rsl has already signed his replacement (nedum onuoha). however, glad has had a disappointing 3028 with rsl and has even lost his starting spot. rsl seem ""willing"", at the very least, to the idea of not having glad as the center-piece of their defense.

&amp;#x200b;

sounders/garth knows that he'll need to sign a younger, but capable, cb this offseason to bridge the gap between the aging marshall (who still is rock solid, but at his age is susceptible to a long-term injury at any moment) and torres (who seems to be on his way out) and the younger generation of u17 and s2 players. i've heard that the fo doesn't feel that sam rogers is quiet ready yet to fill in as a first-team starter.

&amp;#x200b;

rsl seems open to moving him, sounders seem to be in the market for someone of glad's pedigree, and glad himself is a seattle-native. who knows, but i think it's worth garth making a phone call.

happy monday to you all. i hope everyone is waking up this morning with a fresh perspective.

yesterday afternoon wasn't the result we wanted, but its far from where it could have been given the nature of the playoffs and playing in a minor league ball park. that being said, the result of 2 - 1.5 should have everyone feeling jolly this morning.

you can bet the players are waking up this morning ready to ditch some payback come thursday (remember the santa tecla series?)

here's the truth folks, the sounders need to score first, if they do the tie flips and were the ones going through. this forces portland out of their defensive shell and opens them up. i'm aware of the injuries to roldan and marshall, but lets be honest about something. if that were nico and raul coming out with the scoreline we have now, i think we call know its basically over, but thats not the case. we are still the favorites to win this series, even with sliding in torres and shipp,  so do me and the rest of the fans a favor.

   ruidiaz

now i think we keep shipp and nouhou on for 60 or until shipp is gassed. then we put bwana on. however if we score first we should keep shipp on as long as possible then replace with jordy delem (even though he's been suspect in the past). brad can go in for nouhou if he's not producing crosses. if we need the offensive boost, we need bwana.

867,help finding dataset for analysis,"hello you lovely people,

i'm fascinated by the sounders this season. specifically, how much our beloved team managed to overperform their expected goals allowed. i also work with data, and i want to find out if the sounders actually broke the xg algorithm with their talents and tactics, or if they just got really really lucky (or a bit of both). in order to do this, i'm hoping to find a dataset that logs each shot taken in mls. the fields i need for what i'm planning to do:

* team taking the shot
* team defending the shot
* xg of shot
* actual outcome of shot (ideally including miss, block, save, or goal instead of just goal/no goal.)

the fields that would be nice to have:

* distance of shot
* which keeper was in net
* date of match (or any way of identifying which match it occurred in)
* minute of match (so i can watch it and maybe do analysis of what contributed to the outcome)
* anything else, really

i know this is a long shot, since most data sets i've been looking at for this cost a hell of a lot of money, but i'm hoping someone can help me out. i'm sick of national outlets saying the sounders' success is a mystery and due for regression with no real evidence. let's get some cold hard facts up in here.

&amp;#x200b;

with the last week's games in the books, the fallout is that the sounders are probably going to end up in 3rd, with the final standings being skc, dal, sea, lafc, pdx, lag. rsl craps the bed to finish the season and can start prepping for ski season, or whatever it is mls players do in the off season.

&amp;#x200b;

thoughts:

&amp;#x200b;

\- lag have played themselves back in and have an easily winnable home match against a bad houston team to get in.

\- vancouver has not helped the sounders, or themselves, at all. it turns out they are bad. they can start scheduling their winter vacations.

\- with the red bulls hosting an nasl team, the supporter's shield will be determined by atlanta visiting last year's ss and current 9th place team, tfc. not something most people would have thought going into the season (myself included).

&amp;#x200b;

some scenarios to watch for:

&amp;#x200b;

\- sea wins; dal loses (seattle best case scenario): seattle jumps to 2nd and gets a week off! (edit: skc/lafc match has no impact on this)

\- skc, dal, lag win; sea loss; pdx loss/tie (mls' wet dream scenario): skc &amp; dal getting byes, lafc and lag have another el trafico, and sea hosts portland. i fully expect san jose to get, like, 7 pks this week.

\- sea win; random other things happen (most likely scenario): sounders end up 3rd and host lag on 11/1. what would have been unthinkable in june is something of a letdown in october.

\- lag loses: zlatan's nuclear reactor brain explodes and we all die",WestSideBilly,ssfc
962,"our bye scenario: if we win next week and fc dallas does not win, we get a bye.","simple as that.

given lafc and skc play each other, they're taking points off each other.

here are the standings:

skc: 59 pts, 17 w

lafc: 57 pts, 16 w

fcd: 57 pts, 16 w

sounders: 56 pts, 17 w

if fcd wins they're at 60 points, and one of skc/lafc will have at least 60 so we're out.

if fcd ties or loses, they have 58, and we have 59 (assuming we win).

if skc wins, we have more points than lafc. if lafc wins, we'll have the wins tiebreaker over skc. if they tie, we'll have more points than lafc.

if we win and dallas (they're at colorado) does not win, we get the 2nd seed.",RamseyIsTheGOAT,ssfc

i’d love to watch the san jose game tomorrow, but i don’t know if i should expect to find any bar with an actual espn+ subscription. i tried calling a couple of sounders bars, but it seems like the games they play are just through local broadcast which makes sense.

984,sounders will finish the season &gt;2ppg since end of june,"so, i've been posting whether we've been 2ppg or greater since the dark days of early summer.  there was a lot of chatter at the time that we needed to go at least 2ppg in july and august to stay competitive after the hole we dug in the first 15 games of the season.  we did that.  and handily.  we only dipped below 2ppg once (after the draw at atlanta, euch was 3 games in).  some quick facts:

* we're 2.4pgg since july 1st
* playoff berth clinched
* if we lose the next two, mathematically we still cannot fall below 2ppg since july 1st
* if we lose the next two, we will finish the season with the same ppg as last season
* if we win the next two, we will still fall short of ppg from the 2014 supporters shield season
* 2 losses, 2 draws in the last 17 games
* 9 wins in a row (league record)
* 10 consecutive playoff berths (ties league record)

985,"first round bye is still possible, here's how the sounders get to 2nd place.","it's doable, but not without help. 

&amp;#x200b;

above us are, fc dallas, skc, and lafc. everyone has two games left. fcd has 57 points, while lafc and skc have 56.

&amp;#x200b;

fcd is essentially out of reach. they have home vs skc, and then away vs colorado (almost a sure win)

lafc has a home game to vancouver, and then away to skc.  vwc on short rest, and missing a ton of folk (sure win)

&amp;#x200b;

skc has, you guessed it, away at fcd, and home to lafc. 

&amp;#x200b;

what we need is for fcd to win against skc (who are on short rest, and away). and then for skc to win against lafc. 

&amp;#x200b;

this leaves the skc with 59 points, lafc with 59 points, and both with 17 wins. if the sounders win their remaining two games, we'll have 59 points, but have the tie breaker with 18 wins, putting us in second place. 

&amp;#x200b;

if skc wins one and draws, we're out. if lafc wins one, and draws, we're out. we need exactly one win, and one loss. if we fail to win vs houston and sj, we're out.
