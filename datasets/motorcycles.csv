0,new bike/gear advice superthread!,"##new bike superthread! - a thread for questions and advice about gear and bike purchases and questions relating to your newly purchased bike/gear.

feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is. the point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for.

hopefully with the help of all the riders no question will go unanswered. everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all.

please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are.

another great place to try is /r/suggestamotorcycle. 

as always please remember to read the faq. who knows - if your question is deemed to be helpful it may be added to the [faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_a_good_starter_bike.3f) (which you should read)!

1,showoff superthread!,"##bike/gear image megathread! - a thread for you to show off your bike or gear purchases and any associated images.


everyone loves showing off their bike and gear, so here is a dedicated thread just for that.

if you've just bought a new bike, new gear or have a collection of images related to that, post them below for other rideitors to enjoy! did you ride your brand-new bike 60 miles back from the dealership and took some pics on the way? did you see an interesting custom bike in the mall parking lot? was it just a really nice sunny day and you wanted to play with your new dslr? show it off here!

of course, if you have a great story to tell and an album with good captions to go along with it, you are still welcome to post it in the main subreddit. you can also make a selfpost with a discussion starter and any photographs you like linked in the text post area.

if you're not sure if your pics tell enough of a story, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2fr%2fmotorcycles&amp;subject=&amp;message=https%3a%2f%2fwww.reddit.com%2fr%2fmotorcycles) and we will let you know where to post them.

meta content will be removed.

8,rented a bike in orange county this week,"had to go to oc, ca for work this week and ended up having a good bit of downtime so, on tuesday afternoon, i traded my rental car for a triumph t120 bonnie for the rest of the week.  
it was the best bad decision i think i've ever made.  
rode up the pch to santa barbara (3 hours each way) to have dinner with a friend thursday night and spent almost every waking moment that i wasn't working exploring the area.  
not my first time in ca but it was my first time being able to ride there.
1. legal splitting was awesome. seeing people actively move over a bit to let me through was incredible.  
2. the 405 is terrible. not the traffic; i'm from a high traffic area and splitting made it a lot more tolerable. i mean the road itself. the grooved pavement, the uneven lanes, the bumps and holes; fucking terrible.  
3. the pch is the most beautiful ride. especially at sunset. just epic in every way.  
4. it is not cheap to rent a bike. $120+ per day for the bonnie and it was one of the cheaper options. but it was definitely one of the better ways i've chosen to waste my money.  
11/10 will definitely do that shit again!

28,"chain rattling, but tension is ok?","hi guys,

&amp;#x200b;

i feel like i'm making a rookie mistake. this is the first time i've adjusted my chain slack, and i've been noticing a rattling noise coming from the chain for a while even before i checked today. i tensioned the chain to 1 3/8 inches as spec, but i have some questions.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/i0czq5a](https://imgur.com/gallery/i0czq5a)

1: is that noise normal? my bike is pretty new and i noticed it pretty soon after i bought it. unless the dealership set it up wrong, is the noise ok?

2: when i was adjusting the chain slack, the chain would touch this rubber ""chain guard"" or whatever honda calls it when pushing the chain up to measure it. the problem is that when the chain is loosened this screws up my measurement but the only range of tightness that the chain doesn't touch the top of the guard is almost under spec.

i've created this account and the gmail account using a vpn whilst using tor on a vm.

&amp;#x200b;

we have spoken to personal friends who are in law enforcement to find out what is legal and what is not. we will do our best to not encroach on the illegal side of things.

&amp;#x200b;

\*\*i will be referring to my friend who unfortunately had his bike stolen as ""x"" . i will be referring to myself as ""y"". friend ""z"" is our friend who will be helping us remotely from his house. (he has a family and isn't able to join us during our recon).\*\*

&amp;#x200b;

six months ago my best friend's motorcycle was stolen from his garage. the motorcycle is a smaller dirt bike that he had built to be street legal over the past 15 months or so. my friend being the paranoid fellow that he is mounted a bluetooth tracking device under the seat just in case something happened to it down the road. (i know gps would've been better.)

&amp;#x200b;

my friend filed a police report immediately after it happened, the police said that they will do what they can and that he should contact them if he is able the get a ping from the tracking device (not a gps device). six months pass without any sort of correspondence from the device that had been place on the bike.

&amp;#x200b;

last week my friend received a ping from the motorcycle. he spoke with the authorities but was told that they would need more evidence in order to retrieve the bike.

i will be posting a follow up to this post showing the picture of the inside. we were using a bluetooth tracker to narrow down the apartment that it could be in. unfortunately there are 3 levels and the signal strength is the highest on level 2 and level 3. we may go onto the roof at night to see if the signal strength gets weaker to narrow down which floor it's truly on.

[friend z didn't believe that we were able to get in so easily.](https://i.redd.it/rzuc3arbkcp21.jpg)

after we got in we started walking though the building pretending to be on the phone, no issues with any of the tenants. we were able to rule out the first floor due to beacon strength of the tracking device. floor 2 and floor 3 had the strongest signals, the bike or tracker is somewhere in the middle of the building.

&amp;#x200b;

we are going to rig the drone to hold the cellphone that has the tracking app on it. while the drone is flying above the building we will be recording the cellphone's screen to see if the beacon strengthens or diminishes.

i'll be back tomorrow to update everyone.

now i realize, when the bike on 1st - 3rd gear, rpm below 3k, wot is not picking up any more power like how it used to be. 
it used to have a mini wheelie when i wot on 2nd gear below 3-4k rpm, and now i can feel that the power are coming in for a split second and, nothing,just feeling the power are gradually increasing, not like how it is anymore.

he pulled away near my neighborhood so i'm nervous he lives in the area and may pester me further.

his gf was in the passenger seat and she didn't look up from her phone during his entire fiasco, so i think it's safe to assume he does this shit often.

so i took the pads out and the callipers off. i cleaned the pistons quite thoroughly with thin strips of cloth soaked in brake cleaner. once the pistons were clean i started pushing them back in one by one thinking somehow both inner pistons of both callipers were jammed. all four pistons on each calliper moved easily and freely in and out without any catching or grinding.

80,huge oil leak from filter after changing oil and starting bike? (triumph bonneville),"i have a 2015 triumph bonneville t-100. i changed the oil this morning. i put a new k&amp;n 204 oil filter on, and tightened it to 10 ft lbs. i lubricated the o-ring prior to installation. 

i filled the engine with about 3.5 quarts of 10w/40 and started it up. it ran for a few seconds. i gave a quick blip on the throttle and at least a quart of oil sprayed out from where the filter meets the engine. 

i'm kind of at a loss, and left the garage in frustration. any idea what could have caused this? 

edit: it was the old o-ring. i forgot to take it off. don‚Äôt be like me, check for old o-rings.

81,"as a rider, i have a special kind of hatred for those who ""roll coal.""","i live in idaho, arguably one of the more ""redneck"" states in the us. as a result, we have a disproportionately high population of people with massive, overly lifted, straight piped trucks. or ""compensation machines"" as i like to call them. 

while i personally don't see the appeal of a vehicle that unwieldy and unbalanced, i'm also a firm believer in the philosophy of ""to each their own."" 

however, i draw the line at those who modify their exhausts to belch massive clouds of black smoke every time they pull away from a stoplight. 

if you do this, you are an asshole. i don't care for your justification. 

my motorcycle is not my only vehicle. i also have a car. oftentimes, the reason i choose my bike over my car is when it's a nice day, and i want to get out and enjoy it. i want to feel the fresh air, the sunlight. when i'm on my bike, i don't have a nice air filtration system like i do in my car, but the vast majority of the time, i actually prefer it that way. 

so when i'm at a stoplight behind a huge, spray painted matte black truck with offensive and hateful bumper stickers plastered all over the rear window, i know my ride is about to be ruined. 

sure enough, the inevitable gaseous abomination that billows my way invariably causes me to start coughing, my eyes to start watering, my mood to start souring. as someone very susceptible to poor air quality, i know i'll be feeling the effects of this smog for the next hour or longer. 

so, as a motorcycle rider who enjoys the outdoors, fuck you to all the coal rollers out there. fuck your compensation machines. fuck your fragile masculinity. fuck your disdain for the environment and other people around you. 

i hope your truck gets totaled and you get given a prius as a loaner. ",AMagnificentBiscuit,mc

&amp;#x200b;

i stopped riding my 2014 cbr125 november 2018 for winter but didn't winterize it because i didn't know i had to. took it out last month for a 10mn ride around the block and it seemed to do fine. now i'm going back to get it (i live 2 highway rides away from where the bike is stored) and am pretty nervous about taking it out right away onto the highway, or even after a few warm ups around the city. battery seems fine but i feel scared into having to add fuel stabilizer and charging the battery before. my biggest problem is this: **how fucking much felt stabilizer do i add ????** should i go up to the station on what's left in the tank, fill it and then put \_\_\_\_\_ oz in? and do you think it's worth investing in a battery charger and then going through the hassle of doing it? i saw this post on here and makes me feel like i can do these three things but at the same time maybe i don't need to because my bikes pretty new and up to date. i don't want it shitting itself on the highway. it's a 125, can barely take it anyways.

i have not been able to get the front up while sitting down. i feel like i don't have good enough grip on the handlebars while using the clutch to pull up. i also can't seem to compress the front suspension very well while sitting. 

my only working method so far has been; in 1st or 2nd gear, while standing up i sort of hop forward to compress the front suspension, then when it springs back give it throttle and pull up with my body. i've been able to get decent height this way, like 1.5 feet maybe (hard to tell exactly) and ride it out for a second or two. 

it just feels more natural standing up for me, but i would like to learn them sitting down, and i would also like ot learn wheelies with using the clutch since i feel it'd make it a lot easier.. but i am worried dumping the clutch like that puts a lot of strain on the transmission, clutch, sprockets etc and this bike that i'm riding is an '83 so i am a little careful with it.

my thought was to put all the disparate peices back together, and to do something like the old cb750s, have four mufflers. that way you conserve volume flow and you maximize sound dampening (which as far as i know are the secondary purpose and primary purpose of mufflers, respectively).

153,need advice on how to deal with friend wanting to ride my motorcycle,"hey everyone! i was hoping for some advice here.

long story short, i can't keep my motorcycle at home. my mom doesn't support me riding, and even if i wanted to, i live in an apartment complex where there isn't space for an extra vehicle.

a good friend of mine has it in his garage right now, but his mom only wants it there for a month. so, i needed to figure out something else.

another friend is down to keep it at his place long term, but he mentioned that he wanted to ride it. this guy's only exposure to bikes has been an msf course he took 3 years ago. i laughed it off and told him that he could ride it when i'm around and he said we'll see. i think he was joking but i'm not entirely sure.

i'm in a pickle here. i get that him keeping my bike for free is a huge favor, but i'm not comfortable with someone else who's so inexperienced learn on the bike that i worked really hard to get. if i cut him off, i might not have a place to put the bike. i'm starting to even second guess letting him ride it. if i let him ride it, i'm putting extra wear on the bike coming from a beginner, running the risk of him crashing it or worse, hurting himself.

i'm thinking my choices are

a) talk to the good friend's mom and try to work something out like paying a little to keep it in their garage

b) try and explain to the long term friend that i can't have him riding my bike and hope he's cool with it

c) looking harder for a different friend who's down altogether.

anyone have any thoughts?",idkvro,mc

178,advice needed about insurance claim,"longer time lurker, first time poster. running into an insurance dilemma so was hoping to leverage collective reddit wisdom on how to deal with it. 

my parked bike (2013 triumph speed triple r w/abs, in pretty good condition with 5000 miles on it) got tipped over by some careless driver trying to park next to it. she was kind enough to leave a note on the bike so i am filing a claim with her insurance (geico). the bike has mostly cosmetic damage (fairing pieces scratched up, broken foot pegs, slight scratches on fuel tank etc), and i would have just collected the money from gieco and replaced the broken parts myself but the problem is that there is a big noticeable scratch on the engine as well. i am meeting geico's appraiser next week, and i am guessing given the big scratch on the engine they will want to total the bike altogether. given that:  

1. will it be better to let them total the bike and just accept the lump-sum payment? 

2. or should i let them total it and then buy it back with a salvage title since the bike itself is in pretty good condition (frame isn't bent etc), in fact i rode it to work right after this without any issues. 

3. or i should just pass off the scratch on the engine as prior damage and have geico pay for the rest of the damages only. if i do so, will the scratch on the engine seriously compromise its resale value? 

to me, #2 sounds like the best option, especially if they offer to sell it back to me at a good price, but wanted to know if there are any potential pitfalls i am missing. related to this, once i disclose the scratch on the engine to geico as caused by this accident, will they insist on totaling it, or will they still let me remove that item from the damage estimate and not total the bike?

179,"problem after problem, fckin frustratedsjfjjejand. forks are misaligned, one sits way higher than the other, how? cbr 600rr","edit: if you don't give a shit about backstory you can just skip to the * part below lol... i realized i wrote a lot. i'm just really fuckin frustrated with my bike rn lol

hey guys, so i'd been in the middle of doing a bunch of things on my bike since after my accident and there was a decent amount to do. but one thing after another some smaller bullshit would come up like a stripped screw or a wiring issue. so to get to the issue now at hand... today i was trying to replace my throttle tube in my cbr with an r6 tube because those have larger diameters, so less wrist action for throttle response... while that's an easy ass job to do at the throttle housing, it isn't if the damn screws were tightened into oblivion by a previous owner. so i tried and tried and eventually bought an ez-out bit set to use a drill on them. drill was too big, so i had to loosen the handlebar clip ons, which i needed to pull off the upper triple tree in order to move it around for leverage. 

now these are a few things that i may have done wrong prior to have affected the forks rising. 

*did not put bike on a lower triple tree stand when removing upper triple tree, really didn't think it'd make a difference. 

*lower triple tree bolts were a little loose from forgetting to fully tighten them last time i worked on them(mind you bike has just been sitting and getting worked on, wasnt riding).

currently, after trying to put the triple tree back on, i realized the right fork(looking at bike from in front of it). was way higher than the left one. i could not get the triple tree back on. now at the upper triple tree, the handlebar clip ons are at the right height (where there is a silver clip to set the height). but the lower triple tree on both sides are not at the line they're supposed to be at. the right one literally wasn't even at the correct section, it's sitting low at an area where there's a gap between the triple tree and fork, like if you were to tighten the triple tree it would make no difference. 

i'll upload some pics in a second so you can see. 

i really have no idea logically how one fork would rise above the other. by such a margin too. i think the fork definitely rose when i was trying to pull the upper triple tree off initially cause it took a good strong pull, and i noticed the fork lifted a bit too, but i figured it would've sank back in, it didn't. 

anyone know where to go from here..? how to set preload or something? that's all i can think of, but how the fck would that have even been affected for me to need to change it..? 

thanks guys.

mainly when i have my phone plugged in to charge the volt meter goes from like 12.8 or so down to like .83 volts. 

now is this going to ruin my battery? when the volts surge that much due to charging is it going to mess anything up or is that totally normal? or will it put unnecessary strain on the battery?

my bike is pretty old (1983 (the battery itself is &gt;1yr old)) and will run without a battery at all (spark's powered by magneto) and basically just the head &amp; tail light, blinkers and horn operate off the battery. 

also, are volts measuring the the remaining juice available? i haven't tried having my phone plugged in while the bike's on so maybe the numbers will be a little different. just interested in learning a little about this all, thanks.",RockstarPR,mc

188,injector cleaner after 8months storage?,"hi guys  


i've had my bike for 3 years now and i always store it for around 8 months during the winter.  


i always fill up the tank to the max and use fuel stabilizer before putting it in storage. i never had any particular problem, beside a low battery (but that's taken care of now). it's actually kind of amazing how it starts almost right up after a period of 8 months without moving or starting.  


but i was wondering if injector cleaner might be needed after a few years of storage like this, or after every storage period.  


i don't think i noticed anything that would indicate that the injectors are in bad shape. but i don't want to get injectors issue all a sudden because they got clogged up little by little during every storage period. not sure if that makes sense.

191,2000 cbr 600f4 - hoses from fuel tank,"so i bought this bike about two years ago and i rode it heavily the first summer i owned it. this past summer, it sat quite a bit due to some issues with the electrical system (stator was bad) that caused the bike to stall often. 

this spring i've been doing some maintenance (oil &amp; filter, air filter, carb cleaning, stator change, new chain, blah blah) and was in the process of taking my carbs out to give them a good cleaning when i noticed there was:

&amp;#x200b;

(1) a loose hose that had rotted and detached from the underside of my tank. in addition to that, it wasn't connected anywhere on the far end. 

&amp;#x200b;

[mystery hose - both ends, pretty loosely tangled in the interior of my bike](https://i.redd.it/f72xp3rr55p21.jpg)

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

(2) the small hose that connects my tank to my fuel pump split. that one's easy, i just need a hand finding the part no. or some advice as to whether or not i can use a normal hose (the shape concerns me, i don't want to screw something up if i use a straight hose, ya know?

&amp;#x200b;

[note the shape. i can't find this online anywhere](https://i.redd.it/dqlez02x55p21.jpg)

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

(3) a mystery hose that is connected to my tank, but not on the other side ( i'm guessing this goes to my reserve tank and i knocked it loose when i was messing with my stator cover, but i don't know).

&amp;#x200b;

[the origin of this hose.](https://i.redd.it/rhi2tbhz55p21.jpg)

&amp;#x200b;

[where i found the end of this hose. left side of bike, near stator.](https://i.redd.it/snz8cvd165p21.jpg)

&amp;#x200b;

can anyone help my pinpoint where each of these will go, and where i can find replacements? the two mystery hoses will be easy to replace once i know where they lead. i'm a bit more concerned about finding the exact shape for the fuel pump feed, unless i'm overthinking it.

199,first time riding a bike in nearly 20 years.,"i'm 49 and i've just been on my first ride with my 1987 kawasaki gpz900.

back in the late 80s and early 90s i used to ride a 1983 [honda vt250](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honda_vt250f). back then i mainly rode around [sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sydney) with a few forays into the countryside. i always found the vt250 to be great in cities but as soon as you got onto a freeway it was pretty onerous and gutless. i did enjoy the odd fang around the [old pacific highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_highway_\(australia\)) north of sydney though.

there are some great pictures of a younger me on my bike, where i have a thin body and a mullet.

well kids and responsibility meant i had to give up the bike. but my dream back then was always to get a [gpz900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kawasaki_gpz900r).

so today i went for a decent ride for the first time on my gpz since i had it restored (i bought it 7-8 years ago but didn't have the money to restore it, but now i do). i did a 50km round trip between my home in [launceston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/launceston,_tasmania) and a place called [longford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/longford,_tasmania).

it was mainly country roads, speed between 80-100kph on sealed roads with a few curves, sheep, roadkill, hedgerows, tree tunnels, distant mountains, 200 year old stone bridges... you know, the sort of thing motorcyclists experience every day when they ride /s.

so here are my initial impressions after a 20 year gap.

* well, there's no rear view mirror. okay. looks like i have to keep looking in the side mirrors. that's a great reflection of my elbow.
* my legs are cold.
* ouch. cramping at my hip/leg join.
* okay, going around a corner for the first time. easy. eeeasssssyyyyy.
* *splotch*. ah. the first insect hits my visor.
* **bang**, the first insect hits my helmet.
* **bang** the second insect hits my helmet.
* oh look another motorcyclist going in the opposite direction. *nods*. we did the nod! i forgot that we do that.
* my brain says that cornering is safe and easy, but another part of me is just waiting to hit that gravel or oil.
* what is it like if i close my visor fully? oh. that's okay. slightly less noise. now how do i get it back up again (fumbles around visor)
* there's a car behind me! it looks like one of those ricers. i better make sure i go round corners a bit faster while maintaining the speed limit on the straights.
* (continues to fumble around visor)
* **bang** the third insect hits my helmet.
* okay, back in suburbia. check my speed. ooops.",OneSalientOversight,mc

206,impound damaged my bike,"i commute into san francisco by motorcycle most days.  there's metered motorcycle parking on the street and usually it works pretty well... except lately the metered parking has been getting filled up by rental scooters.  as a result, this morning i parked on the street ... and got towed.  suckage.

setting aside the rant about how the whole thing is a racket and the fees are fucking ridiculous ($587 just to get it out of impound + a tbd traffic ticket!), they managed to damage my bike in the process of towing it.

basically, my steering column is designed to lock in lace at an angle to make it harder to steal the bike.  they seem to have actually bent the column to the point where the bolt can no longer engage, effectively breaking the lock.  i filed a claim on the spot with them and also with my insurance and was able to ride it home, but i'm not sure what if anything i can do from here.

so far i've connected wp and wg, b and g and i got the small daytime lights to come on, but regardless of what i rearrange, i can't get my high beams to come on. the other two wires coming out of the bike are for the turn signals so far as i can tell but i can't get my high beams to come on.

 i'm currently sitting in a different bar than i planned on visiting after i got my fill of embarrassment for the day. 

 i've been building a 2005 r6 i bought for $800 as salvage over the winter. the bike is fast, loud, and eye catching. (thanks to the cheap chinese injection fairings i bought.) 

 i went for my third ride ever on the bike today. (mind you, i'm coming from a rebel 250 i rode for 3 years.) i pulled up to my favorite biker bar in the middle of wa-9 whatcom county (where the staff know me well.) and dropped the bike while parking. (damn stabilizers.)

 the 2 or 3 seconds i was on the ground felt like minutes as i could see everyone inside staring. (thankfully my gear and bike are different lol.) 

 i picked the ""top-heavy bastard"" back up and rode off defeated. i had to drive another half hour or so to the next place in shame. my paint is scuffed, my pride is non-existent, and i'm mildly intimidated at the thought of going back to visit. 

--what similar situation have you been in?--

tldr: i dropped my bike where everyone i know could see it.

maybe it doesn‚Äôt bother people with bigger bikes, but as someone who just started her journey through this horror, psychological thriller that is motorcycle riding on a lil baby 125, it‚Äôs kind of like a dick measuring contest to me. like, i went to grab dinner at panda express last night, and the entire parking lot was empty, except for the cars of the workers and like one other guest. and i‚Äôm just chillin, minding my own business, when some guy decides to park his r6 right next to mine, literally in the same exact spot. mind you, there were like... five spots open on each side of me, and the rest of the lot was essentially empty. and like, when he came in, it was like he was looking around the restaurant for who owned the 125, spotted me, and then smirked his stupid little smile. lol

anyways, that‚Äôs literally my only qualm about the biker community. after work yesterday, it was a perfect day to ride, so i went on my first ride that wasn‚Äôt only the 15 minute commute i generally do (i rode for about 2.5 hours) and boy, do i love this thing. i guess i never noticed it, but you know how whenever you pass a fellow motorcyclist you give them a little low-wave? yeah. that‚Äôs so dope. idk. it‚Äôs great. like, a non-verbal gesture to signify that this community is unified is so cool to me. alrighty. rant over.

233,learning lessons as a new rider or how i negotiated a decreasing radius turn.,"hey guys,

today i lowsided going about 32mph, i was trying to negotiate a decreasing radius corner and i came in way too hot (for reference i only have 5 months riding experience). i had way too much lean angle for the conditions (mid 50s, road had debris that i couldn't see until it was too late, overconfidence). today i was humbled, never, ever trust local roads, keep it on the track always. if you're coming in hot, slow down to a reasonable speed. i slid into some old car's wheel and there was no noticeable damage thankfully (i was already slowed down from the slide) so the driver (a female teen, bless her soul i must've scared her shitless) opted to just go home.


for the good news, i was atgatt and i got away with a mild knee bruise and scraped up gear. loads of people from a nearby sporting event came to me and helped me out. i was 100% okay and i was able to ride home (some minor damage to the bike and rear brake lever snapped off). cops arrived and i explained that the car left and i shot the shit with them. they were glad i was okay and that i was smart to wear all my gear. i'll have to replace my boots, jacket and jeans but it was worth it to save a pricey trip to the hospital.

236,what makes a real cafe racer?,"**i posted a link to my blog here earlier, so this post was removed. spoke to an admin and was told just text is ok. sorry about that. without the images it's lost something, but i hope you can enjoy the words by themselves.**

that‚Äôs the big question‚Ä¶before you make your own judgements, let‚Äôs look at what makes a genuine caf√© racer?

first let‚Äôs look back into the history of caf√© racers. where did they come from, and why are they called that?

post ww2 britain was a bit of a bleak place. unlike the usa where the average person had a pretty comfortable life, london and the other big cities directly affected by the war struggled and money was short. (my own grandmother told me that food rationing was still in effect in manchester until the early 1950s). in the 1950s cars were not easily afforded by the average young person, but bikes were. bikes became seen as a cheap alternative to cars, and were (to some extent) looked on as a ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs car‚Äù. by the 1960s, living conditions, the economy, and life, in general, had improved, and now the average man could indeed afford a car. 

&gt;the term caf√© racer was developed among british motorcycle enthusiasts of the early 1960s from watford and london

by the early 1960s the caf√© racer‚Äôs significance was that a bike had come to represent speed, status and rebellion, rather than mere inability to afford a car. 

the term caf√© racer was first coined by these watford and london bikers , specifically the rocker or ‚Äúton-up boys‚Äù subculture, where the bikes were used for races between caf√©s in watford at the busy bee caf√© and the ace caf√© on the south circular. the ton-up name comes from the bikes ability to do 100mph. if your bike couldn‚Äôt do a ton‚Ä¶you sucked by 60s london standards.

these dudes back in 1960s england were tuning their bikes for speed rather than style. the epitome of cool for these caf√© racers was the triton. a triumph engine swapped into a norton frame (triumph norton). the idea being that you could take the best parts of both manufacturers, combine them, and make something better. the triton‚Äôs were usually home brewed projects, but certain motorcycle dealers in london, namely dresda motors, actually built and sold them as complete bikes.

so, where was i? oh yeah‚Ä¶we now know where the term came from, and what these chaps were upto in 1960s england. now let‚Äôs skip forward to present day. 

in the past few years there has been an insurgence of old school cool. the ducati scrambler and yamaha xsr to name but a few of the marques using marketing jargon like ‚Äúneo-retro‚Äù. personally, i‚Äôm all for a bit of retro styling. as you can see from my bike, i ditched the factory headlight for a 7‚Ä≥ round headlight. if you ride a naked bike, i see no reason for anything other than a round headlight. it should be the law!

the retro comeback is all well and good, but, and here comes the big buts (i like big butts and i cannot lie)‚Ä¶

* caf√© racers should be built, not bought!
* buying a caf√© racer doesn‚Äôt instantly make you the authority on motorcycles.
* if you don‚Äôt actually ride fast, then it‚Äôs not really a racer is it? maybe ‚Äúcaf√© poser‚Äù would be a more accurate nomenclature. double cream mocha frappucino with cinamon topping anyone?
* hipsters can fuck off. just because!

so i‚Äôm opinionated‚Ä¶apologies in advance. i respect everyone‚Äôs opinions and the right to do whatever they want. dress however they want, grow any kind of beard they want, style their hair however they want, ride whatever bike they want. that‚Äôs freedom baby and i‚Äôm all for freedom. i just don‚Äôt like how some people think that they are better than another person because their bike is a ‚Äúreal‚Äù caf√© racer. don‚Äôt get me wrong. i like all types of bikes. i‚Äôve owned sports bikes, off-road bikes, supermoto‚Äôs, cruisers, and presently my work-in-progress yamaha mt-07. if it has 2-wheels and an engine i generally speaking will like it.

do i think my bike is a caf√© racer? yes i do. 

the reason is simple; it‚Äôs modified (by me) to go faster, i drink a shit-ton of coffee (black), and i like to ride pretty hard on the streets. the only thing that differentiates me from the original london racers is time. in the 60s they worked with what they had available to them and i‚Äôm doing just that in 2019. the aim with my project bike isn‚Äôt to copy some guy with a super-hard-to-understand cockney accent from 60 years ago. my aim is to improve an already decent factory motorcycle both in performance and looks and to enjoy the fuck out of it.

last words

i realise that i‚Äôve screwed up. i hardly ever go to caf√© s. when i ride my bike i tend to buy coffee from the vending machines found on every street corner in japan. my bike isn‚Äôt a caf√© racer after-all. god damn it! from now on my bike will be known as the ‚Äúmt-07 vending machine coffee racer‚Äú.

240,the language of filming motorcycles,"i put burnout (2017) on the tv the other day as something to have in the background while i was drawing and i found myself thinking about the rarity of non-documentary motorcycle movies.  documentaries have a big advantage over fiction in that they don't have to rely on the suspension of disbelief (unless it's dishonest).  the viewer knows that the camera is a camera and a microphone is a microphone, they capture what it capture.  in a fictional film, though, the camera is playing the role of the viewer's eyes and the microphone is playing the role of the viewer's ears.  the director, cinematographer, sound engineer, and editor have to guide the viewer along in a language composed of individual shots to tell a story.

car movies have a clear-cut language for action scenes.  a car movie can visibly illustrate something that most drivers already do: operate a wheel, accelerator, and brakes, and maybe a shifter if the viewer knows how to operate a manual transmission.  five minutes into any of the fast and furious movies and you'll find a common sequence: car moves into trouble, close up of shift, close up of pedal work or wheel work, zoom or close up of driver's intense driving face, followed by an exterior shot of the car getting out of trouble.  

motorcycle movies have problems that they don't share with their automotive counterparts.  safety is one, and i know this subreddit had a lengthy topic when a stunt rider on the set of deadpool 2 was killed.  shooting a motorcycle requires a safe distance from the motorcycle.  if you want an unhelmeted close-up at speed, you're going to end up with a bunch of obvious trailer shots (like torque, 2004).    

faizon love had a funny segment in an episode of *dinner for five* where he talked about the actors on torque dropping the bikes left and right because they kept forgetting about the kickstand and were more interested in working on the soundtrack.

the other problem is technology.  we've got 4k go-pros now, but if you look at biker boyz (2003) it's clear which shots were on film and which were on video.  the smallest camera you could have mounted to a bike in 2003 on their budget would have likely been something akin to a dv handicam, definitely pre-hd.

i saw the chips film two years ago, and while i didn't enjoy it all that much, i do admire dax shepard's attempt at a subject that still doesn't have a clear-cut film language to communicate with the audience.  part of it, honestly, is the audience as well.  most people, especially in the us, don't ride motorcycles.  the experience of working through the levers, pegs, and throttle doesn't have an easy equivalent for someone who only drives a car.

i don't know how i feel about burnout, though.  lots of great footage of ducatis, but i think netflix's translation may have been a bit off.",DavidAtWork17,mc
241,[discussion/rant] how can we get more long-time riders to wear gear?,"to start off: i love the motorcycle community. i've met a lot of interesting people through it, seen a lot of cool stuff like rare bikes, cars, and other motorized vehicles, and it has been a big way for my father and i to bond more as adults. i want to make sure this global community stays strong, supportive, inclusive, and fun. and the only way we can do that with certainty of effect is to get more people to practice safer riding and gear up before they ride so we don't *lose* members, so to speak.

after i took my course and got my first bike, i had joined a riding group in my hometown and i was glad to see that many members wore at the bare minimum helmets, jackets, and boots, but most just put on a helmet and called it good. i have been to a lot of meets for various get-togethers and see that, as well as notice that most solo-riders on the road, *many* riders are wearing nothing but the state-required bare minimum helmet (e.g. half-helmet) or less. and they are usually middle-aged or older.  
as i rode with this group (in the one summertime i was in it before i moved), i went to 4 different fallen rider candle vigils and had to send more regards to hospitalized individuals than i have ever in my life. three of the fatalities (unfortunately the fourth was dead on impact) and most of the hospitalizations could probably have been avoided if they were properly geared up.

look, i'm not usually one to tell people how to live their lives, but i believe that all of us have people that care about and/or rely on us, and while riding comes with inherent risk, wearing proper gear and being properly taught how to ride in traffic can reduce that risk to *much* smaller percentages. i personally experienced this when my gf and i went down at a ~40mph low-slide and we walked away only bruised because we both had gloves, armored jackets, fullface helmets, and boots. i wouldn't let her be my pillion without that gear and i am so glad i stuck to that rule.

whenever i see someone with hardly any or zero gear on riding on the road, i get upset because they are basically saying ""if i go down at any amount of speed, i'm okay with being hospitalized or worse"".  
it wasn't until i said basically this to my father that i got him to wear a ce-armored jacket, because all he would ever gear up with before was a helmet. i care about him and his safety, so i gave him my old jacket and he now wears it even if its a bit too flashy for his style (it is bright red). his birthday is coming up and i plan on getting him more gear.

even with other peoples' concerns about our well-being aside, when it comes down to it, and i've thankfully seen this echoed on this sub a lot: **gear (and lessons) is cheaper than hospital bills and funerals**. so even if a rider *does* go down in a nasty situation that wasn't their fault, the helmet will save their head, the armor pads will reduce damage to their joints, and they'll have *at least* half as much road-rash than if they weren't wearing gear. this message was drilled into me during my riding course and from doing research on this sub before getting my bike, and i truly believe it is the correct stance from both an emotional reaction and a logical analysis.

i was very glad my father listened to me, but that is just one older rider. how can we get more to follow suit? because i see far too many riders with just normal clothes on when riding and i don't want to have to attend any more vigils for fallen riders or go pay hospital visits because they didn't gear up and help avoid damage.

tl;dr: my rant/prompt basically comes to: encouraging new riders to gear up is easy, but getting older riders to start gearing up is not. how can we get those seasoned riders to understand that atgatt is vital? how can we get the message out there and help break those habits?",SirSkidMark,mc

249,uneven tire wear on left side,"so at the end of riding season last fall, i noticed my rear tire was worn out much more on the left side than anywhere else. i just bought myself a new rear tire i noticed the same wearing down on the front tire. the left side of the front tire is much smoother than the rest of it. is this because it always leans on that side on the kickstand? it's consistently smooth all the way around, not just in certain spots. it sucks because i have to buy another tire.

just so everyone is clear, during storage i raise my bike on the stands for both wheels

edit: so enough of you said it's normal for a tire to wear down like this, mainly because of the long left turns at a higher speed than right turns and because of a road's camber that is designed to help drain away water when it rains. hope others with the same concern find this to help them not freakout lol

my question is: is there any way to insure my bike purely for my test? i am aware that i can contact the insurance company and essentially beg for them to insure me, but from what i have heard it's quite unlikely. am i legally required to have insurance for a test? can i hire a bike for a day? will i be insured if i don't have a license? how much does it cost to hire a bike for a day?

274,what should i learn about my motorcycle and how should i go about doing it?,"tl:dr: i want to learn how to do basic things to my motorcycle like oil changes and mods. where/how do i go about doing that?

i am a fairly new rider(little over a year now) and i absolutely love my yamaha r3. had lots of fun on it and still do. i am a good boy and take it for maintenance regularly according to my dealer's advice (every 10k or so kilometers). now thankfully up to this point i have not felt the need to go under the hood myself. however as i watch mechanics check my motorcycle i feel a certain urge to learn to do certain stuff myself. not looking to become a bona fide gear head, but i would appreciate being able to do some basic things on my own(oil changes and such). i am also looking into adding some red leds on my bike for that red aura feel and have no idea how to connect them or mount them. it is small things like these that make me want to get more comfortable tinkering with my own motorcycle. i have noticed that a fair amount of people mod their own bikes and can only assume that they learned by themselves somehow. how do i learn basic stuff like that without blowing up my ride?",AdeptusAstartes40K,mc
275,selling bike last minute or letting it sit for 5 years...?,"sooo, i just decided to move countries and still have my bike here. if i sold it to the store now, they would give me 500 bucks for it. it's not in the best condition, to get it back to standards right now i'd have to put in around $500-700 (new tires, new front fork etc).

i'm pretty sure i'll be back in this country in about 5 years and i would have a place to store the bike for free.

so the two options are store the bike and have it fixed up once i'm back, or sell it now and get a new one for probably around 3k once i'm back in a couple years.

my thinking is that $500 right now doesn't make a difference to me, but 3k (or 2k with the opportunity cost factored in) in a couple years might.

is there a problem with storing a bike for such a long time? i realize i would have to have the tank drained and replace all liquids once i'm back. i think the tank should still be full as it would rust if empty even when storing it that long? someone could turn it on every couple months, but i'm not sure if it would turn into complete shit regardless.

277,had an accident today!,"i know, we see too many of these threads, but i'm not gonna waste an opportunity to post my own. i got rear-ended by an suv. i'm miraculously okay, just a sprained ankle, got checked out with xrays and i'm expected to live.

i was slowing to make an unprotected right turn, and she didn't brake hard enough behind me. luckily she nearly came to a stop before the crash, so she basically just bumped the bike forward and at an angle (i had juuust started to turn) hard enough to throw me off it to the left. ended up in front of the bike. a semi barely stopped in time behind her, props to that dude for paying attention. here's an example of the kind of street (it's not exactly this):

https://imgur.com/9sclvdd

imagine i'm turning right into the lot there. 40mph speed limit, but you'd think it was 80 the way people act like it's a drag strip. i've always been wary of both turns like this and young women driving big suvs. guess it's not paranoia if they're really out to get you. the thing is, in this situation, i really did all i could short of doing a u-turn up ahead and then coming back to make this one a left. i'm always aware of who's behind me and how far back, especially when in this situation, but she threw in a twist. she changed from the middle lane into mine just as i was braking and looking right through the turn. probably trying to get ahead of some other car. morning rush hour, dark, everyone trying not to be late for work. from behind it must've looked like she swerved just to hit me on purpose.

atgatt saved me from worse, especially my boots and armored jeans. everything on the left side hit the ground, and it felt fine. i remember thinking, right after ""i guess i'm not just fucking up the turn"" that ""that was a comfy fall."" it was the entrance to my workplace so lots of people to talk about it, and at least a dozen said they were glad they always see me geared up.

she thankfully did everything decent after the crunch, we exchanged info, got a police report, insurance should be taking care of everything. nice girl who just needs to pay more attention. 

i'm incredibly lucky in a bunch of ways. the bike's not too bad on the surface, but we'll see after they take a look at it. i'm not feeling too shaken either, but we'll see once i hop back on.

304,tipped over my bike now it won‚Äôt start,"a couple months ago i tipped over my ninja 250 going less than 10mph and it ran fine for the rest of that night, tried to start it again today and it won‚Äôt start but here‚Äôs the bigger problem. 
iv changed the gas, tried starter fluid, checked for spark and all that was fine, replaced the oil since it was pretty dark. it wouldn‚Äôt even pop with starter fluid so i pulled off the carb and the spark plugs and found the plugs were covered with oil so i poured a lot of starter fluid in the cylinders to water down the oil then i cranked the bike over a lot to clean out the cylinders and i cleaned up the spark plugs and i still have great spark yet it still won‚Äôt even give me a sputter with starter fluid. i have absolutely no idea what to do now because it‚Äôs got food gas oil spark clean carbs and good vacuum pull so wtf else could it be, an i missing something dumb? kick stand switch is already disconnected too.

turns out this is the way to do. i was reading the classic motorcycle magazine and there is an article about early r1 models. and they write that this is exactly how you have to do it, they said you open the choke and then you  **have to be really quick to close it as soon as possible** as to avoid the bike reaching high revs when cold. so what i learned starting the 250 years ago doesn't apply here apparently.

352,new flasher relay blew the fuse?,"so i'm currently helping my sister with some scooter problems. the scooter is a vmoto milan. the blinkers weren't working (at this point i've forgotten if they weren't going or were going to fast, i think the latter but i can't remember). anyway it has a 3 pin flasher which i've replaced in the past due to similar problems so i checked that. i took the flasher out leaving the 3 pin connector and sure enough if i shorted one pin of the connector to either of the other two pins then each blinker light turns on (but doesn't flash obviously).

i bought a new flasher from aliexpress. this one:  [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/blinker-turn-signal-flasher-relay-round-12v-3wire-scooter-50cc-125cc-150cc-250cc-accessories/32875030700.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.a4374c4dpnr7vg](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/blinker-turn-signal-flasher-relay-round-12v-3wire-scooter-50cc-125cc-150cc-250cc-accessories/32875030700.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.a4374c4dpnr7vg)

but when i connected it up it blew the 10 a fuse.

&amp;#x200b;

this is what i am confused about. why would it blow the fuse? the voltage matches and i thought flasher relays were all pretty interchangeable apart from the 2 pin vs 3 pin thing. is it that maybe the circuit in the new flasher is dodgy (since it was very cheap) and i should just try order another one from a different seller? or is there something i am missing and i've ordered the wrong type?

&amp;#x200b;

edit: after more investigation (i broke the thing open) it seems they wired it up wrong. that, plus the circuit design they used is pretty shoddy. the price of buying cheap components i suppose. i've managed to find a local place and bought one brand new for 20 times the price (ouch!) but hopefully that should work at least.",Indi008,mc

my cruiser doesnt have a windshield, and wind is the single worst part of the ride. i realise that riding a cruiser at high way speeds you act as a sail, and to make matters worse my bike doesnt come stock with a wind shield. the thing i noticed with sport bikes is the different style handlebars (close together v shape and normal bicycle wide). for example the r1 vs the mt10. 

so my question is, if i get the mt10, with its ultra wide handle bars, more upright ride and lack of wind shield wield the same result my current cruiser does? i truly hate windshields, they just look ugly, but i also want to avoid the constant push if possible.",kapaskae,mc

i gave it some thought and i think there are 3 options:  
1.) man up and ride there and back  
2.) ride there and get the bike shipped back somehow (probably expensive af)  
3.) fly there and buy a cheapo bike for the 4-5 months that i'm there

380,front sprocket teeth change,"so i've a small displacement bike (1983 honda xl200r) that i've been considering upsizing the front sprocket from the stock 13 tooth to a 14 tooth sprocket. 

my intention is to give the bike just a little bit longer gears and lower my rpm's when cruising at 45-50mph. it has a really short 1st gear (like 0-~13mph) but has served pretty well for the low speed/steep off road trail bits. 

i'm just wondering, how much of a difference is 1 tooth on the front sprocket going to make? will it make the gears noticeably longer? will it lower the rpm's enough for high speed cruising? is it going to significantly reduce my torque in 1st and 2nd gear?

386,the most surprising thing to me on the road,"i've been driving bikes for a little over a year now and as my daily driver (and only vehicle), i've driven a decent amount overall. in the last few months, i had to get a new bike because my old bikes engine locked up. since about the start of january, i've driven a little over 6k miles, driving roughly 500 miles per week. most of my commutes involve driving to my job, driving my girlfriend to hers as well as working for postmates on our days off. all in all, i drive about 250 miles per week on the highway and about 250-300 per week city riding.

&amp;#x200b;

i'd consider myself an observant rider (i'm sure almost all of us would), so i frequently look around at other cars/drivers to make sure i'm aware of everything going on around me. if i had to take a good guess, i'd say a good 50-60% of the other drivers on the road are using their phone, messing with their gps or something else (mostly the first two, though). just today, i was riding on the highway bringing my girlfriend to work and someone in front of us started drifting out of their lane a little bit. at first, i thought nothing of it, nobody is perfect, just keep a little extra distance, it's fine, but it happened again. when i was able to pass her, she wasn't just on her gps or phone, she was on her tablet. she was messing with her **fucking** tablet while driving about 60mph on a highway (no speed is acceptable, just the faster you go the more absurd the thought is to even try).. and the scariest part about this whole 60 second interaction was that she drifted out of her lane not just once, but twice, and still had her tablet in one of her hands and her head facing it instead of anything in front of her.

&amp;#x200b;

any time someone has started drifting into my lane, it's almost always because they're on their phone or distracted for some other stupid reason. i know it's kind of the ""name of the game"" riding bikes in 2019 and i know riding isn't always all fun and games, but damn, you'd think after a driver catching themselves ""slipping"" and not being as attentive as they know they should be they would stop entirely, especially while cruising at such high speeds.. with other vehicles around (but i guess they probably didn't realize that and, if they did, they didn't care or they just though they were skilled enough to multitask like that).

&amp;#x200b;

it has been a long day and finally felt like i had enough of a rant in me to post about this, even though i'm sure pretty much every rider (and driver who doesn't do this) probably feels the same.

389,best oil viscosity for my riding conditions?

i spoke with a local mechanic whom i knew and he explained that the oil i used was what is recommended in the manual but it is not the ideal oil viscosity in our country since it is quite hot in here and i need a more ‚Äúvicious‚Äù oil. my current oil basically would behave like water under working temps and with the added temperature of my environment resulting to poor lubrication on my engine, he explained. he recommended some oil like motul or lucasoil with sae 20-40/20-50/10-50. should i follow his advice? which of the 3 should i choose? thanks everyone!

my shop guy offered to come pick it up to donate to a veterans organization that refurbishes bikes. my head says this is smart: some guy or gal who served our country can have a cool bike that i have absolutely loved. when the season is right, i can get a new bike, maybe with a bit more power, something a little newer whose mirrors don't get wonky while i'm riding.

418,fi 05 cbr600rr flooded? poor mileage,"19k miles on odo.

i probably shouldn't ask here but i'm a novice rider/journeyman auto tech.

i think my bike has leaking fuel injectors. apparently the damn thing has 8 of them and rebuilt primary injectors are pretty commonly available (common problem?)

my bike has always had questionable mileage and a mild fuel/rich smell. i started it sunday for less than a minute to move it. the bike crank/no started the following thursday.

i got it running again by saturday evening and am certain it had flooded. i certainly didn't change any parts other than siphon out the fuel tank friday night because i suspected bad gas. it effectively started after some time to dry, a little gas and cranking at a mix of full and light throttle (nearly the same procedure to start flooded fuel injected cars).

i've ridden it without fault since but i suspect i'm on pace to get less than 80 miles out of a full tank.

anyone experienced- are y'all changing out all 8 injectors as standard practice?

**tldr part 1:** did a quote for the bike i bought using year and model  but when i plugged in the vin it came up as a different model and doubled the rate. 

**start of part 2:** after paying the doubled rate right before purchasing my motorcycle i called the insurance company to make sure a section i couldn't alter online (not needing to have motorcycle insurance before) so it could be corrected. the agent i spoke with after giving him a run through of what i typed up in part 1 double checked all their sources, repeating what the first agent did, and knew something wasn't right. he sent a couple emails as he knew there was a discrepancy within their system. 

he left me a voice message today stating that they are working to resolve the error in their system (the vin for the 2018 cbr300r coming up as the cb300r), and will honor the proper rate for myself and my motorcycle which is $220 a year. 

coverage

250k/500k/100k bodily injury &amp; property damage liability

25k uninsured motorist 

no medical, income loss, or collision coverage. 

other than collision - $250 deductible 

custom parts and/or equipment value (includes protective gear) up to $3000 insured.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

several insurers quoted me over 1,000 per year with no collision coverage. 

the only two quotes that i got that were reasonable were from dairyland and harley davidson insurance which quoted me 270-290 but less insurance for my gear/bike modifications.

i spent about 3 hours on the phone between two days. i ended up with the best coverage for my motorcycle and protective gear at the cheapest yearly rate out of 7 companies. 

thanks flo!

i've never ridden anything quite that big though (biggest was a 500 before). it's super smooth and i rode it home from the shop after it got inspected. it was terrifying but felt amazing. yesterday, however, i was going to a parking lot nearby to practice some low speed turns, sharp turns, etc and leaving my driveway there's a fairly big bump and onto a busy street. i was a little scared and the bike got wobbly and i ended up choking it off and almost dropping it. i got it upright and restsarted it and no harm done but i'm shaken ever since. i was scared in the parking lot and it affected my ability to practice. i just kept worrying it was going to tip over.

i can flat foot on the bike on level ground. it sits low. it's well balanced. it's heavy but not too heavy i think. i'm just a bit shaken. i want to get out and ride but not till i master the slow speed stuff on this bike.

i am signed up for several motorcycle courses in the next few months starting at basic beginner (with 250 cycles provided by the state) up to intermediate courses with my own bike. i know that will help but how do i get past my nerves and regain my confidence. ",phillysportsfangirl,mc

439,drift or grip motorcycles,"we know that motorcycles has much less grip than cars, thus slower in corners. we also know when there's less grip, drifting becomes more beneficial as it helps point and steer car/motorcycle into the right direction. (rally cars, dirty bikes)

on a race track, pro motorcycle racers like to ""back it in"" so the bike points into the turn. in motogp we also often see riders sliding all over the place, especially marquez. he slides through many turns but doesn't seem to lose out on speed. also...supermoto. 

so my question is, does sliding around turns reduce speed, or have no effect, or maybe possibly be faster? (an efficient drift, not one for show with trails of white smoke)

they are a support mc for a 1% mc; apparently they got a very stern talking-to about not starting a new mc without going through ""proper"" channels, and some ""friendly advice'. the 1% mc **is not** one of the six that are considered criminal enterprises (hell's angels, banditos, vagos, mongols, pagans, outlaws), but... i really don't want to end up on an fbi/dea/batf/nsa watch list.

to elaborate a little more: i have a friend who wanted to get into riding, he ended up buying a dual sport motorcycle like a year ago and rode it maybe 2-3 times. to be honest i don't think he's the type of person who should be riding- he panics easily, has a lot of anxiety, he just doesn't have that mentality to ride.. that sharpness. idk the words to explain it. the last time he rode he dropped the bike twice (on gravel at 0 mph) and he's been too scared to ride ever since.. i tell him he should just sell the bike- but he's stubborn and refuses to sell it by saying ""he'll try learning to ride again after x"" ..which ""x"" is always some far away parameter that he'll change as soon as it arrives.

i want to sit down with him and just tell him flat out he's not the type of person that should be riding to begin with, but i'm not sure how to do it without insulting him because he can't take criticism well. ",RockstarPR,mc

rode today, pulled up for a stop and was sat with my headlights on and the engine running for about 5minutes before the bike conked out. tried to start it, battery obviously flat again (electric starter didn't even whir). had a similar thing at work the other day when i left it for the day and accidentally left the lights switched on, and when i came back to it the battery was flat. 

any idea where the issues are here? the bike starts fine when it is left with the lights off etc, it just seems that the lights are draining the battery, which they shouldn't?

i'll be largely living an all natural, organic, non-gmo, free range, cage-free life and won't need a cage but occasionally (visiting family and friends a few times a month. wife and doggo travel with me.)

i have a 2nd floor apt, so interior storage isn't a great choice.

i am planning on buying a used [cargo style van](https://i.imgur.com/0rj0edn.png) and retrofitting it as a garage.

https://i.imgur.com/snq2eyv.jpg



 it got removed for sorta breaking the rules.  i still wanted to share my project though so i put some more stuff together.  i didn't intend on posting this much originally so i didn't take as many pics of the process as i could have.  i searched through my phone and came up with a handful, enough to make a little bit of a story for y'all.

i never had the intention of creating a ""show bike"" or doing a complete restoration to make it just like it was 40 years ago.  i also didn't want to chop it up and make something totally different.  instead i wanted to clean it up and make it fun, functional, and reliable yet similar to the way it originally was.  it's now smoother, quieter, and less leaky.  with that being said i used many brand new parts along with a bunch of used and or repurposed and some custom made parts.

here's the fun i've been having, i hope you enjoy!

543,i need help. ducati wont start after i tried to start it while charging,"hi all

apologies if this is the wrong forum to ask for help. but kind of desperate

i own a ducati 848 streetfighter '13 thats been sitting in my garage for a year because it wont start and i havent had a chance to get it fixed due to time (and real life baby). i dont know enough to troubleshoot it myself but finally have some time, so am hoping i could get some guidance on how to troubleshoot the problem

problem: my bike has a trickle charger installed which ive used countless times to charge up the battery since i only ride every few months or so.
last year i had to take it to a shop to get it certified for registration (australia) and hurriedly tried to charge it up same day in the morning, hoping id get enough to start it up by afternoon

lunchtime rolls by and i took it off the charger...nothing. so i figured it needed a few more hours, but time was running out

in aus you cant ride your vehicle if the registration runs out and when it does, its more effort than just renewing it to begin with. so in my rush i tried starting the bike a again in the afternoon..except this time, i forgot to unplug the charger and it was still switched on at the mains.

the bike lights up and a horrendous  screech sound followed by buzzing happens. and the dash lights go crazy then black out.

i freak out. unplug everything.

later i tried to start the bike again, the dash/ecu or whatever goes all weird and crazy, displaying nonsensical messages and lights on the screen. i think ive fried it at this point.

after calming down. i disconnect the battery for a bit. put it back. pop the charger back on for a few more hours

next day. i unplug the charger and try starting the bike

dash finally lights up normally. but when i try to start it, the the engine wont turn over. and all sorts of fan noise (prob radiator? or fuel pump even)  start to sound and i can hear it struggling to start.  

no matter what i do at this point, the bike wont start anymore. someone mentioned to me i may have flooded the engine or something and to turn the throttle to release the fuel. done that didnt help  

the only things i havent tried:
- jump starting it with a car battery  
- push start  
- replacing the battery  
- paying a professional to look into it ($$$$)  
- check fuses (i dont know how)  

i literally spend a grand a month prior getting a full service and ecu tune. so was hoping to spend more money so shortly after.

i dont have a trailer or any mechanically savvy friends that might be able to help me take it to a shop either, so the bike is stuck in my garage


given the dash lights up via the battery, im not sure if the battery is the problem. its probably some other electronic component thats damaged but i dont know how to troubleshoot

would anyone be of any assistance so i can at least get it started and taken to a garage? right now its stuck at my house

544,my clutch broke (not cable) and not sure what's happened?!,"hello riders!

i had the unfortunate experience of somehow braking my clutch on my 1997 honda ntv650.

546,is there a trick to installing/adjusting drum brakes?,"i just installed some new drum brake pads on my front wheel.

at first i was having trouble getting the hub back in with the new brake pads (too tight of fit) but then i saw the piece that rotates on the inside to spread the pads (dunno the name of it), so i tried to adjust it the best i could so that the hub would fit back in with as little room as possible. 

so everything's in place and i go to squeeze my brake lever and there's zero grab. i ended up adjusting the cable down by the wheel as far as it could go then the same up at the lever and i finally got it to get a decent brake, but when pushing the bike forward and with the brake lever fully pulled i'm not getting the front wheel to fully lock. 

are there any tricks for this? i believe it's the piece that spreads the brakes that need to be adjusted properly, but i can't seem to adjust it without taking the hub out of the wheel, but then if i spread it anymore than it is, it doesn't want to fit back into the wheel. ",RockstarPR,mc

558,kawasaki ninja 300 2015 - stuttering problems,"so at the end of last riding season i started noticing the bike was stuttering almost like as if the chain was catching or was loose or something. the stuttering isn't loss of power but i did notice that if i pulled in the clutch a little bit the stuttering would completely stop. it happens when driving slow - and faster. it's a little concerning and i'm avoiding riding until i can fix the problem. any suggestions on what this could be or how to fix it? i am not super mechanically inclined but i can do a few things. should i just throw it into the truck and bring it in to the shop or what's the best way to handle this? 

i took a look at the chain and it did seem possible there was something wrong with a link on the chain, and it did feel a little loose but not awful. the chain is greased and mostly clean at the moment. 

the bike is ~ 17000 km and i haven't replaced the chain or sprocket as i bought it second hand last year if that makes any difference. 

if you have any suggestions let me know, 
thanks.

559,carby air/fuel issues,"hey guys,

new er5 / new to motorbikes here. got a er5 for 1600 (bargained from $2000) thought it was a good steal, maybe i'm wrong maybe i just haven't done enough maintenance.

bike was running smooth for about 2 weeks which was great, then it started to run rich. bike would feel like it was running on one cylinder and then when it got hot would jerk into full power. this was quite scary so i gave the carbies a spray with carb cleaner and a few days later it would start up with both carbies running.

started to do it again and at this point cracking the throttle to get it to start was the norm. one day it was very bad and took about 30 minutes until it was working on full power. i'm sure it might be something with the float being too high and its storing too much fuel. i cracked the shits and thought maybe it's because i leave the petcock on. i only have on, pri and res, so i left it on res overnight.

the next night i thought to give it a ride to see if this solved my problem. now after switching the petcock back to on, it's idles fine on start up, but now when i ride it to about 3k rpm the bike cuts out and switches off. so from running super rich it'd now running super lean.

i am aware it's definitely something to do with the carby balancing it out, now it maybe the fuel delivery cos now i've fucked with it. after all this i'm new to bikes and bought this to learn - i feel like this is something i need to learn as well.

575,"i took my bike out for the first ride of the year, crashed, still came home with a smile","yeah, i know, not the best way to start the year. but when you look at the whole picture, i'll take it.

so i got the beast out of winter storage, fired it up, and changed the oil. while i only need to take one side of the fairings off, i took all the plastics off. i bought my vfr secondhand, and i was told it fell over in the first owners garage, and there were some scratches on them. nothing you could see 30 feet away, but i figure as long as it's early in the season, i'll take some fine grit to it and clean them up.

so this afternoon, i spent it with various fine grit paper, rubbing compound, and buff rags getting the fairings as clean as i could. some of the spots went through the paint to the black plastic. i have some red gloss spray paint i got in case i needed it to do this quick fix. i got the paint last fall, i figured i was going to store it without the fairings and do it over the winter. oh well.

go to look for it, and it's nowhere. pull stuff out, still nowhere. finally after looking 98% of the square footage of my room, there is is. about 40 minutes later.

go out, shake it like those actresses in the shake weight infomercials, and go to put the first light coat. top won't budge. fuck with that for a few minutes, then slam it on my knee. top goes flying. no spray tip. didn't come off, trust me, i looked for a half hour.

fuck this. i'm too flamed up from the search for the paint, then the search for the tip that i just say fuck it, i'm going for a ride.

get all my gear together, get my tire guage, get the now naked bike, and go for a ride. spin by the gas station and made sure my tires were full, then went for my route.

last season, i found a route that is a circle and takes you on a 45 minutes jaunt over some fun twisty roads. first ride, in not going balls out, just having fun.

so much so, that after waving at some other bikers, the tears of joy and exhilaration had me thinking, shit i can't see.. this isn't good. but if it happens, i couldn't be happier.

it's been 4 months since i've hit this route. i missed a turn. i came across completely unfamiliar scenery, but a familiar state route. so i figure i'll take the big roads till i get my bearings.

then the fuck up of the day. i saw a rustic route trail sign. rustic roads are just that. wandering wisconsin trails that usually are not straight,  have great scenery and no traffic. as i get on this road, i'm on top of the world. come around a bend, and see the twisty sign next 2 miles. i accelerated a little. come around a bend to a shit ton of sand all over the aggressive corners i now had to get my bike through. brakes, even feathered locked up. i kicked it down a gear, it didn't slow me enough to comfortably take this next left turn coming up. i slowed it as best as i could and decided to go off road. the second there was no pavement, the bike slid out. had i tried to make the turn, i would have tested my armour, helmet and gloves. the bike slid on soft ground, and having no plastics, i scratched the coolant overflow tank and the mirror.

had i been squid riding, i'm pretty confident if have been fine. no scratches on any of my gear, and only the two superficial scratches on the bike. i got the bike up, got it back in the road, and started it up and made my way home.

still got to ride in today. i managed to make a learning mistake that did not hurt me, the bike, it anyone else. i hit my leg on something i found out after the adrenaline started to wear off, i'll probably be sore tomorrow, but we'll call it a learning mistake, and hope that's the last time i go down. i know now (i already knew this but for some reason ignored logic) not to go fast on an unfamiliar road without scouting it out first. i made it down the rest of the sandy road fine at a cautious speed i would have had been going had i followed logic.


tl:dr took my bike out for the inaugural spring ride, rode way too fast into a twisty country road they had dumped a shit load of sand on. layed my bike down, but managed to do so without any major damage to it, since i had the fairings off. also managed not to hurt me, or anyone else. pride was the only loser today.

ride safe guys. believe it or not, i can't wait to riding again. going to make sure my leg is fine and that it can hold up the bike when i'm stopped. we'll see tomorrow. fingers crossed it's nothing.",blodisnut,mc

601,[help] high idle - cbr600rr - 2006,"hi everyone,

&amp;#x200b;

looking for some help with a high idle on my 2006 cbr600rr. not sure when the issue started, but has definitely become apparent in the last month of riding.

&amp;#x200b;

currently, my bike idles at \~2800 rpm and, if kept in first gear, will hover at around \~21 km/h with no throttle input whatsoever. interestingly, rotating the throttle backward (beyond the resting position)  does decrease the idle rpm to about \~2500.

i re-calibrated the throttle set position in the powercommander 3 app...this worked somewhat, reducing idle from 3300 --&gt; 2800 rpm.

maybe also worth mentioning that i recently moved from an area of relatively high elevation to sea level...i've heard of running too lean causing a high idle, but this would have resulted in a more rich fuel mixture, no?

&amp;#x200b;

any and all help is appreciated :)

622,ktm rc 125 (2017) possible steering issue.,"hello,

wondering if anyone might be able to shed some light on an issue i noticed with my bike yesterday. i'm the first owner, 870 miles with the first service done at 630 miles.

i popped into town yesterday and parked the bike for about 15 minutes. upon returning to the bike it felt as if there was some resistance when trying to move the bars to the right (e.g slow right hand turns/swerving/moving around cars in slow city traffic) it felt almost as if there was something between the frame and the bars preventing the bar from physically moving all the way to the right. the knock on effect of this is that once it reaches that point there's some resistance which causes the motorcycle to lean/dip to the right when i don't want it to.

any thoughts on what might cause this kind of issue from previous experience? i've only been riding bikes bout 6 months in total so my mechanical expertise is fairly limited. i did wonder if it was maybe something to do with the steering lock as it did seem problematic to get it to lock at times.

thanks for any input.

anyhow, most tire manufacturers suggest riding 50-100 miles ""conservatively"" to break in tires. as someone who has never had to break in new tires before, this is a bit confusing. as long as i'm not doing burnouts &amp; wheelies, i should be fine? and even if i ride for a hundred miles, wouldn't the edges of my tires still need to be broken in? i mean i can't spin around on the edges of my tires for a hundred miles just to break them in?

tl;dr - how do i break in the *edges* of my new tires? after riding for a hundred miles, should i still be careful when going into corners? when can i start taking corners with more ease?

&amp;#x200b;

i picked up a 1978 honda cd/cm185 a few weeks ago, it's a lovely thing but it's having an engine issue and the question is how far down the rabbit hold do i go as an amateur? basically it was running like shit, nailed down a couple of stupid things - there was a wiring loom stuck in the air intake under the seat which i zip tied to the frame, no problem. this was after taking the carb apart and giving it a good clean, double checking fuel mix etc. changed the sparkies, checked ignition timing etc.

&amp;#x200b;

the real thing is, though, is the right hand cylinder plug is glossy with oil, which eventually fouls up and stops working. smoke from exhaust indicates burning oil; i know that this could be valve stems/seals, piston rings, piston shape or cylinder - i've got the service manual and the haynes manual which together are a good guide for diagnosis and teardown...

&amp;#x200b;

the thing is - i can change rings/a piston by following the guides, but things like grinding valves, boring cylinders etc. are way beyond me as a hack with a spanner. also i wouldn't know what to look for to nail this down, and it could be more than one thing (i used to service macs, *more than one thing* is the worst thing to nail down).

&amp;#x200b;

i've found a mechanic who'll look at it (i said i'd remove the engine and take it over to save a bit of ballache and labour), so i'm gonna do a compression test tonight so he's got those figures. 

&amp;#x200b;

what do you think? should i just let a mech take a look at it and leave it in the hands of experience, or is it potentially gonna be so expensive i should try harder to do it myself? all insights welcome, i'm leaning towards not getting involved with the engine while the cause is unclear, but i do need to learn this stuff eventually :-d",genghis__karl,mc

update: to answer a few questions/suggestions, my apartment garage has a gate (very slow...all you have to do is wait for another vehicle to go through) with the only camera. they had installed ground anchor iron loops bolted to the concrete floor which i had locked the rear wheel to. i saw the footage...two guys, one did all the lock breaking and hotwiring off camera, then hotwired the gate on camera (didn't realize it was motion sensor to leave?) and waved in a car with a lyft sign (i assume so no one would question why he was sitting there), and 5 minutes later both vehicles left, bike behind. for some reason the guy that hotwired it was in the car and the lyft driver was on the bike. talked to the cop, and she said there were 5 other bikes stolen last night around the city and they have leads on a bike theft ring. i'm hopeful but i'd rather just get insurance money and see the guys rot in prison. i'd be happy with that.",Wizardbysmell,mc

tl;dr super worthwhile, not very expensive, gives skills you can use every day, regardless of bike size or experience level.  go to one, if at all feasible.

the marketing seems primarily aimed at riders of heavy cruisers, but the techniques will work with any size bike.  two students were on large indians/harleys, as was the instructor, one of us was on a yamaha naked, and then there i was on my vstrom.

a one-sentence summary of the class could be, ""learn how to ride, turn, and stop under complete control, so you don't look like an asshole duck-walking your shiny cruiser through parking lots, or drop it while trying to make a u-turn.""

the techniques are squarely in ""simple but not easy"" territory.  that is, the actual mechanics are not complicated - the hard part lies in applying them consistently and correctly.

in much the same way that olympic-level archery is as simple as hitting the bullseye as often as possible.

the class amplified and expanded upon several things covered in msf courses.  for example, clutch use, u-turns, looking where you want to go, swerves, and emergency braking.

the primary ""trick"" is use of the clutch friction zone, that magical place where the clutch is neither fully disengaged, nor fully engaged, but rather purposefully slipping.  czf lets you carefully and finely apply power to the rear wheel.  controlling power is the key to riding slowly but steadily, turning as tightly as the motorcycle will mechanically allow without falling over (or zooming off into a parked car!).

mr. rear brake is also your friend.  he is used to stabilize power application, as well as the clutch, although once you get good enough you won't need him much, if at all.

the only somewhat dangerous part of the class was emergency stops from up to 35 mph.  35 is fast enough to be realistic, and can get scary, especially if you don't have abs (i don't, heh).  but, no one dropped their bike, though i did lock the rear wheel on my first attempt, and briefly slid the front wheel on another (yep, found the ""threshhold"" in threshhold braking!"").  still had braking ability left on the table, at the end - more practice needed.

at $150 for 6-7 hours of instruction &amp; riding, i found the cost quite reasonable.

may do it again next year, to see if i really learned anything.

it really gets me when people in cars drive really close behind someone on a bike. especially since my dad broke both of his wrist because he was at a light and the person behind him in a car didnt give him room. the person in the car behind my dad ended up getting rear ended then pushing my dad into a van.

anyhow, after charging it to full based on my battery tender indicator - i could read ~ 13.15v right after unhooking it and if i let it sit for a day, it would go to about 12.85 or so. after hooking it back to tender and measuring charge with voltmeter- it would be around 14.5v.

now, should i consider this battery needs to be replaced or i somehow got lucky ?

698,motorcycle in the city. advice/rant,"my dad gifted me his 2003 moto guzzi california stone, partially because he has two other bikes and doesn't ride it anymore, and partially because it needed $2500 worth of work. i just got the bike back from the shop february, and i've been so happy.   


in the last week i've had to file two police reports. one because someone stole my license plate, and another for a hit and run while it was parked. after the license plate was stolen, the officer told me ""this is the season for it"".

a few days later i notice that my turn signals were smashed up. looked closer, both right turn signals, brake lever, and spark plug was damaged. along with cosmetic damage and spilled oil. luckily, my gf was leaving the house right when some jagoff in a box truck knocked it over trying to pass a school bus. she didn't notice it when it happened, but the rear dash cam caught the truck knocking it over, then driving off.   


the police said that they wouldn't investigate it unless i had the license plate number, which i didnt since the car was moving away from the truck. he also said that having a motorcycle in my neighborhood isn't a great idea. i don't live in the best neighborhood, but thus far i havent had any issues with my car or house. 

&amp;#x200b;

once i get the damaged fixed i'm seriously considering selling the bike. it breaks my heart, i've been wanting to ride this bike since i was 13, and now that i finally can i just feel like it's going to be one headache after another. i fucking love this bike. i love the dry clutch, the heel-toe shifter, the god damn look of the bike, the riding position, and transverse vee! it's an amazing bike, it's not perfect, it's italian.  


to say that the cost of repairs isn't an issue would be a lie, but it's not just the cost, it's the stress of it being parked out front. worried that something will happen to it. then when something does, the frustration of getting it fixed.

the only concern i have is water making it's way in and damaging things, but that's unfounded as far as i can tell. some people even say they uncover it during storms, i guess so the wind doesn't blow it over. to protect against theft i'm getting a disc lock and already have theft insurance.",h1k3rbr0,mc

776,should i keep riding my 250??,"hey y'all

i got my endorsement about 3.5 years ago through a weekend training course, and last summer bought a ninja 250 and rode it for a couple months. i had messed around on my little 125cc dirtbike in my teens but the ninja was my first street bike.

well i picked up a k7 gsx-r600 a couple weeks back, and it's obviously a shitload of fun. now that i've had a few hours on it, the speed isn't so astounding anymore- i'm getting pretty used to the throttle and acceleration. 

that being said, i: (1)haven't fully opened it up, and (2) know that in spur of the moment events, snap-reaction can lead to stupid decisions/actions. those reasons are making me increasingly paranoid to be on my gixxer.

so, i am basically wondering if i should keep the 250 and keep pushing myself on that, or if my season on the 250 is enough to warrant me selling the 250 and continuing with the 600 from here on out. i know i'm a beginner still, but  it's difficult for me to determine *how much* of a beginner i am, given that i do have *some* prior experience riding. i dont want to be that guy who jumps early and gets in over my head, but i don't want to stay on a 250 forever because i don't have any riding buddies as a reference point by which to judge my skill level. 

also, i would like to do some advanced training courses this season. would it be best to do these on a 250?

edit: i didn't mention, but i'm addition to just wanting something a little more fun after a short season on the 250, a major reason i stepped up to the gsx-r was because i wanted something i could commute on the freeway with, that wouldn't require me to be sitting at 8-9k rpm for so long. my ninja tops at about 75-77mph and i always just feel like i'm torturing it at freeway speeds. plus, those wind gusts from passing vehicles or a beezy day are rough on such a light bike.

additionally worth noting, i have never been a *super* competitive or cocky person, but the whole issue with the ""it won't happen to me"" attitude that people get is, well, they really don't think they are making themselves an exception. so i am posting this to get a different perspective as yo whether or not i am being overly cautious or not cautious enough (which i suppose is always the case with motorcycles.. there's no limit to how safe you can be)",sea_milo,mc
777,breaking in the new r6?,"hey everyone! im happy to announce i'm a very  happy owner of a 2017 yamaha r6! and since this is the first time i've bought a bike new, i know i need to break her in, any advice?

so far i've ridden 55(ish) miles around my neighborhood (probably not exceeding 35-40mph)  and this weekend is the first time i took her onto a ""real"" road, and got her up to 55, i won't lie, i didn't launch it but i wasn't necessarily easy on her either, probably got it to 8-9k rpm but shifted and sorta just chilled for a while near 4-5k. yesterday was the second time i took her out onto the 55 and i tried to be more gentle accelerating, and i tried to vary the rpm more, i shifted into 6th and was at 3-4k, downshifted to 5th and even 4th, trying to just vary rpms

i've read multiple things on the internet and have gotten pretty much two answers, ""ride it like you stole it"" or ""baby it, then at 500-600 miles, fuckin brap her to next year""

i absolutely adore this bike and i love it to bits, my goal is to have it for a very very long time and i hope to keep both of us in tip top shape, and i guess i'm looking for advice and reassurance that i haven't fucked her up at all. (as i'm writing this there's 82 miles on her, if that's important)

788,"[2015 versys 650] something is wrong with my lighting on my bike, but not sure where to begin.","hello all, so not sure where to start on this but i am, possibly, having two different lighting issues with my bike. 

last year, my low beam blew out, this was the first time it ever happened, and was about 4 months after i had bought it used at 15k miles. chalking this up to being a used bike and seeing this as a chance to upgrade, i purchased a pair of h7 premium lights for my versys 650, everything was all nice and dandy. and then like 6 months later the low beam blew out again. okay, fine, still under warranty i got it replaced. and then 6 months later and a week out of warranty, it blew out again. a bike low beam shouldn't blow out three times in a duration of a year and three months, especially with it being premium lights on the second and third time. 

however, to complicate this. i added auxiliary flood lights to my bike last year after that first light replacement. this was done by rerouting the auxiliary's positive and negatives into the existing wires, so that they would turn on whenever the high beam also turned on, rather than the typical setup of having them go on with a switch separate from the high beam. 

trying to figure out why it has blown out a third time, i asked my bike shop guy who said it *might* be a faulty ground. i took the head of my bike apart and traced every wire to see if the wires were in contact and not loose. everything *seems* to check out. 

now to complicate this again: my second issue. my pass switch on my versys also doesn't work. not really caring about this issue much i never took any action on it, sometimes when i ride over the past year, i would push it out of boredom a bunch of times just to see if it would do anything, out of the past year i could probably count on my hands the amount of times it came on. but because it did come on at least a couple of times, this indicates to me that the wires were okay. 

after spending the past hour taking the head of my bike off and checking those wires and then googling the issue, i think the issue is that the contact on the switch just needs to be cleaned. i purchased some contact cleaner, and am going to do that later. i also plan to use the contact cleaner on all the wires lighting the high, low, and auxiliary lights as well. 

my concern is that the low beam light is going to keep blowing out twice a year, and that i'll be doomed to an existence of replacing my low beam. so my question is, other than doing contact cleaning, what could possibly be damaging my low beam and what can i do to fix this?

my fianc√©e isn‚Äôt the most graceful, so i just pat her leg, asked if she was ok and just assumed she tapped my helmet as she was adjusting in the seat. it wasn‚Äôt until we got home that she admitted to me she had dozed off for a second and tipped forward and hit my helmet, which of course woke her up.  

i have never in my life been so scared of something that had already happened. i tried to explain how bad that could have been if she dozed off and tipped any other direction. she kind of laughed it off, but it definitely seemed like it scared her and she knew it would upset me.

after parking my car (i do ride a bike, just not to get shopping) i walk towards the entrance where i see the rider of the moped exiting. as expected he didn't appear to have a disability to warrant taking the space. maybe he was mentally disabled as he wasn't wearing gear, he was wearing trainers, cargo pants and a t-shirt. uk law enforces the use of a helmet so at least he had one of those.

after hopping onto his moped and starting it up they accelerated as fast as possible (only a 50cc so not that quick but fast enough for a carpark with lots of pedestrians). they proceeded to pull up to turn right on the complete wrong side of the road. they were treating the junction as though he was on a one way street, a car had to wait for him to pull out of the carpark as they sat in their way.

one guy in front of me was shouting about it to his girlfriend. he was making a point about how riders like that make the rest of us look bad. many car drivers have a lack of respect for motorbikes due to the actions of the few terrible bikers. they see us as speed driven nutjobs that have no care in the world about ours or their safety.

please people ride safe and respect other road users. motorcyclists have a bad rep as it is, please don't make things worse. respect our fellow road users and they'll respect you.

whenever i read youtube comments, it's mostly just arguments between bikers and ..drivers?.. about who was more in the wrong. 

question: how does the motorcycle community feel about this situation? 100% for lane splitting? split 50/50? 95/5? 

is the biker at fault or the car? situational?

852,losing power while riding,"bike info:

2009 yamaha v star 1100 custom

less than 1000 miles on it

new battery, recent maintenance at a shop. 

running premium, carburetor. old owner said carb was recently cleaned.

&amp;#x200b;

background:

so i bought this bike from a guy in the military, that's why it's so low on miles. he got it and ended up overseas. put it in storage. he gets back and decided to move to alaska for work and is selling pretty much everything he owns here in texas. before he sold it to me he took it to a local powersports store where they supposedly did basic maintenance on it and rode it in and out of the shop for a month before i contacted the guy directly, he picked it up and we bought it. i am a new rider to my stepdad rode it around for me for a few miles and it all seemed fine to him. 

&amp;#x200b;

we trailered it home because it was 30 degrees and wet outside that day and neither of us wanted to ride it 70 miles in that crap. a week after i got it home the weather cleared up and it was comfortable enough that i decided to take it out and ride for a bit. i got 10 miles from home and she died on me. ended up being the battery. okay, fine. it's been sitting. replaced that, filled her up and drove a 30 mile round trip to the dmv to get my endorsement paperwork finished up. she ran beautifully. 

&amp;#x200b;

yesterday i decided finally i would take her to work, a 100 mile round trip, which is why i bought a bike to begin with. i made it there with no issues. smooth ride, ran like a champ, all good. i get off work at 11pm and head home. i make it 10 miles and am cruising along about 70 when all of a sudden i start losing power. the lights aren't dimming, she's not dead, i'm just decelerating no matter how much throttle i give her. i drop to 40 and all of a sudden i am good to go. i get back up to speed, cruise for 5 minutes and she does it again. i fight this off and on for a few more miles before she just completely dies and will not restart. i am on a hill in a 70 at night with a curve at the top. the ditch on both sides is very steep and there is almost no shoulder. i whip it around and coast back down the hill to a driveway. 

&amp;#x200b;

now in my stressed out state of mind i feel like when it died and i was trying to restart it that the headlight was slowly dimming. that would mean the battery was dying which would indicate to me that it was probably the stator right? well here is where it gets weird to me. i called my stepdad to come trailer me home and while waiting the 30 minutes or so for him to get there i decide to try the bike again. starts right up, no issues and no hesitation. i kill it, restart, no problems. i hope on and do a little loop around the street. no problems. i park it, kill it, restart it. i let it idle for a bit. no problems. 

&amp;#x200b;

i decided to still trailer it home because i was about to be in a cellphone dead zone but it's weird. at first everything screamed stator to me. now we are thinking maybe the fuel pump? anyone have any suggestions or experience with this issue? i drove this bike 80 miles on a brand new tank of premium before this happened.

&amp;#x200b;

1. replace damaged parts, plastics being the main concern.  downsides are that they're not very easy to find, and are gonna cost a decent amount to get painted and looking good.  i've got a yellow bike, which i'm finding wasn't a very common color.  also, i'm not sure what my return on investment would look like if i choose to sell it next season.
2. keep it as-is and try to sell it down the road.  i'm not sure anyone would want to buy it in its current state, however.
3. turn it into a streetfighter project bike.  i've seen some done well, and some not-so-well.  i'm not terribly adept at wrenching on my bike, let alone fabricating new parts, but it'd be a fun learning experience.  i do have a history of starting projects and not finishing them though.

i don't have any idea what could have caused a crack like this, other than crappy material.  the only thing the mount ever gets used for is to hold my phone obviously, and it sits between the bar clamps so nothing can hit it, and the grip itself has rubberized inserts that should dampen vibration, not that my bike has a lot of those.

887,help with non-oem clutch kit,"hey guys,
i recently purchased a clutch kit from barnett for my 2012 nc700x.

i‚Äôve just finished fitting the new plates into the clutch basket and there‚Äôs a sizable difference between the height of the new kit vs oem. 

the new plates fit in the basket just fine, but with the added height the teeth of the clutch center no longer reach the pressure plate.

there‚Äôs a solid 2-3 disc/plates that don‚Äôt seem to be reached as well. 

is this okay? it seems like i would want the center teeth to be attached to the pressure plate but i have no fkin idea.

thanks for your help.

tldr: new clutch discs taller, is okay?

update: i called the barnett service line this morning, after some back and forth we determined that the kit they‚Äôre selling on their website is incorrect. service guy has sent me replacements via priority mail.",GroovyPorchlight,mc

889,bike chokes out at higher rpms?,"hey all,

&amp;#x200b;

i don't see a lot of mechanical questions here... so if this is the wrong sub then i'll find somewhere else; apologies in advance.

&amp;#x200b;

bike: 15 harley 883

issue: just got home from deployment and pulled the bike out the garage. had to change a battery but after that it started right up. i let it idle for a decent amount of time. and it rev'd up in neutral just fine. took it out on the neighborhood. first gear below 20 mph was just fine... above that rev range or in a higher gear it was acting as if i  reached a limiting point (much like a governor on a car) or stopped giving it gas all together. i'd get little spurts of it trying to catch but then nothing. 

&amp;#x200b;

ideas: i'm hoping this is as simple as ""old gas"" as it's been damn near a year since it last ran. but i won't waste time draining and all that if you guys can tell me it's something else. i appreciate all the help folks.",Tango-16,mc

had to take my v-strom to work today. the roads were perfectly dry but a bit white and salty. 

i know that salt, in any form, isn't particularly good for motorcycles. what's the best way to counteract its effects? i can't give my bike a wash now--it lives outside, and the temperature will dip below freezing tonight. 

is it safe to wait until tuesday or wednesday before giving it a thorough wash with some cold water, soap and s100? 

thanks! ",PrettyFarAwayNow,mc
901,2016 fz 09 whistling sound,"i picked up a used fz09 from the dealership the other day. i noticed today when decelerating/ let off the throttle i hear a high pitched whistling noise coming from the engine/front of the bike. when i pull the clutch in it immediately stops. 

one thing to note i caught my bud playing around on the bike messing with the shifter. it looked like he was shifting through the gears (up and down) with the engine off and no clutch use.   


two questions: 

\- did my bud just mess up my bike by forcing it to shift when off with out the use of the clutch?

\-  should i been concerned with the whistling sound?

911,how to make sure an old bike i bought is safe to ride,"so i bought a 2003 triumph daytona 600 with 25.000km a few weeks ago.

i went to ride a few times but i'm always worried that something might break down at high speed and that i might die because of something i have no control over.

it seems to be in a good overall state, but what are the most critical parts i should be checking ?

and is it safe to ride an old bike like that at 180+ km/h, do wheelies, doing full accelerations etc... ?

&amp;#x200b;

edit: i know how to check all the basic stuff, i was talking about more advanced checks within the engine etc. also i'm afraid that if i go to a random mechanic, he might not check everything properly/will try to rip me off, so i wanted to check everything myself.",excheetahh,mc

4592,delayed throttle response,"got a 2015 cbr1000rr and when i‚Äôm going at a constant speed (let‚Äôs say 60mph) and then left off the throttle and let engine braking take place to slow down for a corner or something and when i try to get back on the throttle, there is a delay of where i‚Äôm twisting the throttle (about 10% cracked trying to apply smooth throttle through a corner) and no power is delivered and then suddenly after a short second the power kicks in. i have a slip on but don‚Äôt think that makes much of a difference. i did lowside and put the bike together and it‚Äôs been running fine except this one thing of the delayed throttle response. again it only occurs when engine braking is occurring from what i‚Äôm noticing. i‚Äôm not sure if this is like a honda thing where it‚Äôs like that from the factory as honda‚Äôs throttle technology or if it‚Äôs a mechanical/electrical issue? please advise.
