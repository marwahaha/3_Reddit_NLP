1,my smokin’ lady,"i work at a gas station, yippee.

there’s this cute little old lady that comes in every day. think 5’2”, 100lb, 90 year old lady. she gets a $5 scratch off, a $2 scratch off, and two packs of l&amp;m light 100s. and she’s absolutely adorable. if she wins on the scratchers, she gives whoever’s working that shift $1. 

one day, i had it all ready for her when she walked in the door and she cracks a joke about coming in all the time. i said “well, you’re the only one who gets l&amp;m’s, not to mention multiple!” and she comes back with...

“oh honey, i’ve had lung cancer three times. beat it three times. god wants me to smoke.”

i was.. speechless. three times?!? and beat it? her doctor is probably so upset. like “hey bitch stop smoking you’ve got cancer again” and this lady’s like “loooollllll, nah cancer’s nothin”.",nicktocknicktock,tfr
2,woman throws a tantrum over not being able to bring her basket outside.,"ok first this is on mobile. second i don’t work at this store, but was right behind this “basket case”, and i thought this would be a good place to post this. and sorry if this is the wrong place to put this...(where we are from everyone calls them baskets, no matter how big or small lol, but yes i am talking about a shopping cart when i say “push basket”)

 ok, my friend and i had gone to a local store to buy a few packs of meat ( they have this awesome sale of 4 packs of meat for $20, all are priced individually for like $8/10, so score!) for this bbq we were cooking that night. we walk up to the checkout and there is a woman in front, with one of the small, arm baskets. (store has two kinds for anyone who doesn’t know what i mean, the big ones you push around or the small one for just a few items). the woman turns and starts talking to us ( nothing out the ordinary, we are a small, southern town, where everyone talks to everyone) about how this was her first time in here since they opened and the prices are amazing. we agree and she starts to check out. this store has workers that go between the registers and bag up the groceries for the customer. one of the baggers stopped to bag up her two small bags of items, grabs the small basket to put it back where it’s goes. 
   (lady-l, bagger-b, cashier- c, manager-m, police,-p)

l- um excuse me i still need that!

b- oh, i am sorry ma’am i thought you were finished shopping.

l- i am finished but i need that to bring my groceries out to my car.

c- i am sorry ma’am, but the small baskets can’t be brought out.

l- well how the hell do i bring my groceries out (she had two bags, one one held a loaf of bread) 
 
my friend and i looked at each other with “wtf is she serious? she could easily grab the bag and walk to her car, but she was throwing a fit about a small basket! anyway....

c- ma’am you can easily grab the bags, they are not heavy.

l- well then he will carry them out! (points to the bagger)

b- i am sorry ma’am i can’t load your car for only two bags, plus i have this elderly man who need me( full push basket).

l- i want a manager now!

(my friend and i roll our eyes at this point. oh here we go)

c- (calls for manger)

m-  hi, what seems to be the problem?

l- your staff is being very rude and won’t let me use the basket to bring my groceries out to my car! and won’t bring them for me since i can’t use the basket! (woman is almost screaming at this point)

m- ma’am please calm down, the small baskets can not leave the store because they have been stolen in the past. and we have to save our loaders for people who seriously need them. you only have two small bags. now can you kindly take your purchases and move on so my worker can continue to check out the rest of the customers 

l- (gets in managers face) well than you fucking carry them out! 

m- no! please leave before i call the police 

l- i ain’t leaving until someone does their fucking job!

at this time a police officer had walked in (he wasn’t called but was just stopping to buy himself a soda while on patrol) and heard all the commotion. 

p- is there a problem here (he was talking to the manager)

l- yes! these people won’t do their job and are being very rude

m- (ignoring her) this customer is being irate and disrespectful to my employees and is refusing to leave. 

l- they are refusing to let me use the basket to carry out my groceries! how would you feel!?!?

p- (looks at the bags) ma’am are you seriously having a cow over two bags? 

l- well...

p- if you don’t want to be arrested over your own stupidity, i suggest you pick up your bags and go. (looks at manager) unless you would like to press charges now?

l- (turns white as a ghost)

m- if she leaves now, i won’t.

l-( grabs bags and runs out the door)

policemen and manager walk off together and i finally get to check out and be on our way... all that over a basket....

3,"when a drunken customer repeatedly belittles his wife and argues with you over his total $6,800 in debt","context: i'm a part-time call operator for a credit card company we're going to call ccc, naturally. basically, my position entails mostly taking payments over the phone from customers (which i will call cm's for short), giving them info on their account, processing lost or stolen cards, transferring to specialty departments when needed, etc. typically, i'm the first person cm's talk to if they ask for an operator, the gatekeeper to their accounts so to speak. 

now, for one of the weirdest/uncomfortable calls i've ever gotten. cue the dramatic build-up drums. 

when the call first came in, it was pretty standard procedure - the caller was the cm's wife (we'll call her pw, for both poor wife and prisoner of war; both feel accurate to me) and was giving me some back story on how she had just called a few minutes ago and made a payment to the cm's account, and that she was both wondering why the amount was so high, as well as if she could order another card for the cm. 

a quick glance at the account told me *exactly* why their bill was so high. the cm's was over his credit limit of $3,800 by $2,800. that made his total balance of debt on the account, as of that day, roughly $6,600. on top of that, the cm had missed his last payment, so his account was marked as ""*delinquent*"" - for ***31 days***. 

i imagined the agent she spoke to before me had explained this to her, which is why she made a payment of $3,000 to get the account back on track. but after relaying the amount to her husband, suddenly he was up in arms about the ""outrageously high amount"". 

(sidenote: for those of you who maybe don't know how credit cards work, since i didn't either before working for ccc; you have to *use* the credit card to accumulate debt. every month, you have the option of making a minimum payment or paying off the entire amount of what you spent that month, called a ""statement balance"". if you don't pay the full statement balance, you accumulate interest on that balance when it carries over into the new month. so, not only did this guy spend thousands of dollars *over* his credit limit, he also missed a payment, so he would be seeing a late fee, *and* interest for carrying that balance into the new month.)

due to the card *type*, however, i had no authority to discuss *any* of this with her - were ccc to listen back on that call, they would have expected me to transfer her to the card type's specialty department immediately. which i attempted to do. 

but then this happened. 

me: no worries, pw, we definitely want you and cm to be informed on the state of your account and get that new card out to you! let me get you over to our specialty team so they can discuss the payment with you and send you the card. (i have been trained to say this, don't @ me)

pw: oh, okay, that's no problem! are you able to at least send us a new card first, before you-?

she doesn't get to finish her sentence before suddenly, i hear the distinct shuffle of the phone being passed between hands.

cm: \*slurring, muttering belligerently\* ex-*cuse* the...stupidity, miss

pw: \*in the background, yelling\* fuck you, you \*incoherent yelling\*

me: \*sitting there, eyebrows raised while cm laughs at the sound of her yelling\*

this should be good.

cm: i don't need a...new card. 

pw, still in the background: yes you do, you lost it yesterday-!

cm, ignoring her: i just need to know why my *fucking* bill \*laughs for no reason\* sorry for the...profanity \*more laughter\* i'm sure you can hear her in the...background. 

he proceeds to talk himself in circles about how all he wants to know is why he needed to pay so much, interrupting me every time i try and get a word in (which, honestly, isn't unusual in my position, but it's still frustrating - as i'm sure you can imagine). 

me, after nearly five minutes of him asking the same thing without giving me a chance to answer: well, sir, i completely understand-

cm: i'm just looking for a frank answer, here, uh...what's your name? 

me, seething: shelbydeebee, sir. 

cm: right, shelbydeebee. you can be frank with me, can't you?

i've been trying to be ""frank"" with him for twelve. minutes. i can't tell you how badly i wanted to say, ""frankly, i think you're too drunk to be having a discussion about your poor finances with anyone, sir. also, i think you're emotionally abusive to your wife and that she should cut her losses and divorce your lame ass."" 

but, 'tis not the way of ""quality customer service"".

instead, i said in the shortest way i possibly could (so he couldn't interrupt me) that i needed to get him over to ""my specialty team"" in order for them to explain the state of his account, because again, *i have no authority to discuss his situation with him in my position, under absolutely no circumstances*. were ccc to listen back on that call and hear me trying to explain his account to him, i could get written up for that being that i have not been trained to handle his card type. ***even if i got all the info right and didn't make a single mistake, they would still write me up***. there was no way for me *not* to transfer him. 

his answer to my still needing to transfer him after nearly twenty minutes of him slurring himself in circles, was this:

cm: so your frank answer, is that you're too stupid to answer a simple question?

me: ...

i. was. fuming. 

but there was no way in hell i was going to risk getting written up for going off on this guy when i'd already fought so hard to remain in the clear company policy wise. i grit my teeth, muted myself while taking a breath, and responded. 

me: i want to make sure you get the best possible answer to your questions. i'll go ahead and transfer you so you can receive the frank answers you would like, sir. 

*click*. 

i honestly wish there was a better ending to the story than that, like this guy getting his just desserts somehow. my only solace is knowing that no matter who he talked to, he wouldn't be able to drunkenly insult his debt away. he will still owe ccc, with interest, between $3,800 to $6,800 depending on whether or not he let the payment his wife paid stick. and honestly, self-imposed destruction is enough karma for me.

4,are you f***king colour blind? ...,"so working in a health food shop i met a fair share of strange customers, not all of them pleasant. 

i will be the first to admit i have a limited education on many things like geography, science .... and colours outside of the generic red, blue, yellow, slightly darker red etc. unless at the time they were model paints then i’d have been able to tell you ultramarines blue from royal blue at a glance!

anywho one of the things our store sold was herbal remedies and one particular range of 15 products packaged them in coloured boxes (same shape and size) in colours of the rainbow, with two or three shades of each in some cases. 

in walks this older lady, about 70 who couldn’t reach said products so called me over to help her. as i greet her she points to the products and gruffly says “i need the mauve box”.

staring at the boxes my mind goes into panic mode. inwardly i’m thinking “what the hell is mauve... think, think, she’s scowling at me!!” 

grumpy lady shouts at me “well are you going to help me get the mauve box?!” 

so i take a punt and reach up towards the red area, sort of certain it’s on that spectrum but before i’ve even touched a box the lady screams at me “what the hell is the matter with you, are you fucking colour blind or something?!?” 

feeling a way to claw back some dignity here, whilst also condemning myself to hell for my next action i reply “yea sorry” (i’m not) 

my then girlfriends brother was colour blind and i knew from hanging out with him, anything red came across different shades of brown to the point he couldn’t tell one from other. using that knowledge i followed up with “sorry they’re all just brown to me” 

bracing myself for further remarks, i’m left stunned when in a complete f’ing role reversal this grumpy rude customer goes full sweet old granny on me! next thing she says is “not to worry, it’s the third one from the left” (which personally now looking back id say was actually closer to harlot red lipstick then mauve but sure) 

sweet old granny mode enabled she pays for her shopping and went on her way, leaving me and another co worker to contemplate the possibly of split personalities and the future of my immortal soul",Drakan7,tfr
5,when the health of a small child outweighs a birthday party,"during high school and beginning of college, i worked at a children’s toy store in a big city. it is a store where kids can build their own stuffed animals and dress them in expensive clothes. that job was really fun overall and i worked with a great team of mgmt and coworkers. 

at the store, we offered to go through the process in employee-led parties. this event happens during a really busy time. being a saturday during summer or sometime around christmas. the store is a fucking zoo. packed in customers to front to back. line out the door. back to back parties are scheduled. a real circus. super loud. you get it. 

i was finishing up a birthday party in the front area of the store and another coworker just began one. they were probably about fifteen minutes in when i hear shrieking and the crowds moving out of the way. 

apparently some poor kid had passed out in the front of the store in the same area the party was in. this kid was just there with family and not with the party. 

my manager working was super professional about everything. mall security and an ambulance was called. shit was insane. once the kid is wheeled out, everything dies down. (we found out later this kid had a medical issue resulting in frequent fainting and was completely recovered. my manager and the fainting kid’s mom kept in touch). shift continues. 

so parties are over. shops closed. everyone is exhausted. go home. 

a few days pass. my manager gets an angry phone call from the birthday kids mom. the mom is screaming and livid that this kid passed out during her child’s party and should be compensated more (we always gave away free shit. company encouraged really high guest satisfaction), people should be fired, the typical shebang. my manager just told her no and hung up on her. 

next day. corporate calls my manager. apparently she complained to them. they had the same wtf reaction, were told we handled the situation well, and that was it. 

never saw that crazy bitch again. ",_______walrus,tfr
6,"""the only cherry pie my man's getting is mine!""","this is an apology in advance in case i didn't do this right. haha.

so i work at a gas station. i've been at this one since october and have had no problems at all really, nothing major. 

well last night, i was running behind and failed to pay attention to a transaction i was making of a muscle milk and a cherry pie. the total ended up being $2 even. i was in such a hurry to get through the customers i had in line that i did not realize that i had accidentally double scanned the pie and only scanned the stupid qr code on the milk. the guy handed me $2 and left.
and then, 15-20 minutes before the store closes and a good 3 hours after the man was there, a woman comes in. i say hello, she seems fine and says hello. she looks around and grabs a muscle milk, a pie and walks up. 

&gt;me: "" did you need anything else tonight?""

&gt;woman: ""just 20 on 3""

&gt;me: ""okay""

&gt;woman: ""todays been so rough, my son had a ridiculously gross nosebleed all over himself at school today, all over the new outfit i just bought him.""

&gt;me: ""man that sucks, i use to get a lot of nosebleeds as a kid, it was awful. oh, your total is 25.38""

&gt;woman:""what happened to 2 dollars even for this stuff, stinky?""

&gt;me: "" huh, yeah someone did come in earlier and that stuff was only $2, give me a second to figure what i did wrong here.""

&gt;woman: ""yeah, that was the father of my child.""

&gt;me:"".....okay...well i found the ticket from earlier and it shows that i accidentally double scanned the cherry pie he bought and i must have missed the right bar code on the milk and i didnt catch it for some reason.""

&gt;woman: ""you should probably pay more attention, that means you gave something away for free. you stole""

&gt;me: "" well, it was just a mistake, it's nothing i cant fix.""

she walks out and the regular that was behind her and i look at each other like...what the fuck dude. 

when the woman is done pumping her gas, she comes back in to ask for the reciept. i hand her her receipt and she starts talking while walking towards the door.

&gt;woman: "" you better pay more attention to your transactions before you get yourself in trouble because i will be speaking to your manager.""

&gt;me: "" okay, that's perfectly fine.""

&gt;woman: ""there's no way you didn't catch that that stuff only rang up to $2, i think you're just giving stuff away and that's stealing and i will be letting your manager know and also just to let you know, the only cherry pie my man gets is mine!""

and away she goes as i stand there completely confused and dumbfounded.

&gt;reg: ""well that was fucking rude.""


tl;dr i messed up a transaction and a women came in to purposely get those exact items and then accuse me of flirting with her significant other?",SufficientlyStinky,tfr
7,"no, you can't have his change","tl;dr at the end

i worked as grocery store cashier in the early 90s. most of my difficult customers were simply confused senior citizens (florida), but one heck of a karen sticks out in memory (also one roid rager, but another day for him).

we were down the street from a sport center where a number of pros trained. they shopped with no issue, until one got himself into big tabloid trouble. he was always great, but the paparazzi were not.

while he was shopping my co-worker came back from her smoke break to report pap outside. pap got frisky and came in. that was strictly against company policy, but pap was an ass about it. he wound up screaming assault when our manager wouldn't let him further in the store. i headed back to give athlete a heads up. offered to let him leave out the back. he handed over two twenties and said to keep the change.  

i went ""shopping"" for duplicates of his stuff so i could ring it up and not mess up inventory. also, i had no idea how else to handle getting the money into the store coffers without my register coming up way over (bad metrics). when i finished ringing it up, a karen appeared out of thin air. she wanted to know what i was doing. i explained. she saw me put the money in the register and make change. i was legit not sure what to do with it. i couldn't take tips (only baggers). my manager was still arguing with the pap and waiting for the cops. i set it to the side and turned to karen to figure out what she wanted as her stuff wasn't on the belt.

karen wanted to know what i was going to do with that money, and why it wasn't secured in the register. was i stealing it? i explained. she demands, ""give it to me!"" i was at no on that. i didn't know what i was supposed to do with it, but not give it to karen. she started having a screaming fit that i was stealing from the store and tried to grab the cash. i snatched it up first and stuffed it in the charity bin figuring that would end that. nope. she kept screeching and tried to open the charity bin for ""her money.""

two cops arrived about then, and split up between the incidents. karen's story changed as soon as she saw the cops. also her demeanor. suddenly she was super sweet. that was her stuff i just rang up. now i wouldn't give it or the change to her. i'd stuffed the change in that bin and she was just trying to get it back. i needed to be fired and arrested. meanwhile, karen still had a full cart right behind her. i suggested pulling the security tapes. the cops liked that idea.

karen kept smiling sweetly and telling me how i was about to learn what it's like to get fired. i should have given her the money. it would have been no skin off my nose, but now she's going to destroy my life. i have to listen to this crap for quite awhile because pap is screaming first amendment, and it takes time for the security tapes to be pulled and reviewed.

sure enough, i can be seen arriving with a basket/money well before karen shows. she sputtered and insisted both were hers, she was shopping for a friend and i'd been helping her. they pulled more tapes. i was never anywhere near karen while she was shopping. the cops looked to my manager, does he want her arrested or escorted out? our national never liked to approve bans from the store without arrests, so arrest. karen flipped out screeching that she'd never touched the money or the stuff! she'll sue! karen and pap left in cuffs. they got to share the back of a police car. i think they deserved each other.

i don't know what charges, if any, stuck for either of them. security footage and statements were taken. at least it completely ruined both of their days. and we had their cars towed.

tl;dr: pap tries to get to pro athlete in my store. shit show ensues. athlete leaves out the back and overpays. i ring up duplicates. karen demands the change. flips out at no. tries to take the change. change goes in charity bin. cue total flip out. karen lies to the cops. tapes reviewed. karen and pap arrested and cars towed.",sunnykl,tfr
8,gamer gloves guy,"a bit of back story first. 

so i work in a computer retail/repair shop and i'm front of house, customer greeting, sales, answering phones etc but i'm still a tech and a huge geek but i'm quite good at talking to people and keeping a conversation and with retail i've had to learn how to conflict manage well enough.

me is me, obviously. 
c for customer or cu*t up to you. 
m for manager (sick guy but not referenced, this is already massive) 

anyway, this guy calls up and i start the conversation off with the usual.
me ""redacted computers, how can i help you?""
c ""hi mate, do you have gaming gloves?""

for reference if you know what they are the you would understand where i went from here but they're essentially gunnars but gloves that apparently wick sweat and helps your grip, snake oil stuff, i've never heard of them before just now anyway.

i chuckled but not heaps, it like a short ha in a questioning voice. 
me: ""no sorry, i've never heard of them""

that little chuckle was apparently a bit mistake.

c ""no need to fucking laugh mate!"" he sort of snapped whilst saying this so it was abrupt and very angrily said.

me ""sorry, i just...""
i was so taken back as i just was so bewildered as i would never expect someone to explode this much.

c ""what? do you think it's a fu*king joke?""

me ""no, i just...""

c ""don't you think that it's pretty sh*t customer service!?""

me ""oh my god"" i said this with a sigh and just hung up.

this wasn't even a minute long. 

i then spun around and talked to my manager, it's quite a small team and in a small office so my manager was in ear shot, he was already was smiling as if he read a funny story, i explained that he was going to have to deal with an angry customer.

lo and behold c calls back and as per expected he just says ""i want to talk to the manager"" again, short and very pissed off sounding.

there then proceeded to have a conversation and from what he told me that he was extremely pissed but a few things.

- i swore at him (again, manager in ear shot so he would of known if i did) 
- i was terrible at my job and needs to be dismissed
- he's been in customer service for 25 years and he's never had someone that disrespectful (gonna call bs on that)
- he's going to get the business audited and have an outside company come in and interview us and take action accordingly (i don't think this exists in australia, also g'day)
- i wouldn't apologize because i was a ""sh*t cu*t that doesn't respect his fu*king customers""

it's so outrageous as wearing gloves makes your hands sweat more!

tl:dr dude got angry that i laughed a bit and had to speak to the manager. ",Redoz100,tfr
9,an old woman and cigarettes.,"reading some other stories made me think about posting my own, so here it goes. 

at the time i was fresh out of high school and decided that i needed a job to help with student debt, college books, a car etc. now, i wanted a local job, which i don't think is too much. i knew the town inside out (grew up there my whole life). only place i got an interview with was a retail store. i didn't get a full-time job, but i did get part-time. the people were fantastic, other than one or two negative people. my job was simple. stock when there are no customers, and when there is a customer, register. at this point, i was probably two months in (only worked very little due to terrible scheduling).


now, when i saw this woman i thought, ""simple enough! older folks like me plus they're pretty chill."" she broke the stereotype. to paint the picture better, i'm like 6'2 to 6'3, and i could look over this woman.

me: ""hi! welcome to -store name- how can i he-""

old woman (ow): -cuts me off- ""cigarettes. one of the red pack ones.""

me: ""alright ma'am."" -gets them and scans them- ""i need to see your id.""

ow: ""what?! don't i look old enough to buy these?!""

me: ""ma'am...can i just see your id?""

ow: -shows me- ""there."" -puts it away quickly-

me: ""sorry, but i didn't catch the year.""

ow: ""why do you even need my id?!""

me: ""it's in the store's policy. if i do not ask for it, i could be terminated."" at this point, i was sick of her attitude, and glad i can force a happy face.

ow: ""get me the manager! now!""

me: ""alright."" so i called the manager, i am so glad he was an alright guy.

manager (ma): ""what's the problem?""

ow: ""he hasn't gotten my cigarettes!""

ma: -sees that i haven't filled in the year yet- ""your id?"" at this point i looked at him as if to say ""that's the problem!"" -looks at me then back at ow- ""i'll check her out.""

ow: ""see?! he's not doing his job!""

ma: ""well ma'am, he needed your id, because if he doesn't ask for it, he could be fired.""

at this i was trying not to laugh. this woman was furious at me for listening to my store's policy! eventually, she got her cigarettes and the manager told me do the exact same thing incase something like that ever happened again. also, never saw that woman again. if i did, i'd probably have to go through the same song and dance with her a second time.

10,little brats steal things and get away,"this literally just happened, and i hope that the brats involved have a reddit so they see this. additionally, i’m still salty, so there may be some mistakes. 

obviously, i work in retail. i was tidying up the store, and i noticed a pair of boys being loud. as i was cleaning up the room with glowing products (it’s dark), one of them tried to scare me and talk to me. at that point, i was less than thrilled with these two, but i chalked it up to goofy kid stuff and shrugged them off. 

i moved to a different area, and clean up other places. then the security system goes off, and i quickly go to the door to check. low and behold, who would be there but the two brats. initially, i was concerned that it may have been a mistake. then, i saw a security tag on the bag one of the boys was carrying. that was obviously store merchandise. after the boys pretending they had bought it and had it with them, they tried to escape. i was in their way, and did not want to move. unfortunately, a manager waved it off, and i had to let those brats leave. 

overall, i hope those brats see this and are ashamed of themselves. 

if you are the two boys who just tried to steal, you’re not welcome back, and you’re terrible brats. ",ogPeachyPrincess,tfr
11,"some guy i rang out the other day thought i was going to ""hack"" his phone.","i work at a clothing retail store and over the weekend i was working as a cashier. my store has a coupon going on where you can get 20% off your purchase if you sign up for our text list. in order to do so you just pretty much text a number and they send you a coupon. so anyways i began ringing out an older couple and they asked if there were any additional coupons they could use. i told them about our text list and how they could save 20%. the guy was into it but he, same as alot of the older folks that come in don't really know what to do so i offered to set him up on his phone for him. he said ok and handed me his phone, he then looked at me and said ""you aren't going to hack my phone and steal my identity are you?"". i look at him and said i am not and i guess that wasn't enough for him so he ended refusing to sign up for the text list and lost the 20% off. oh well ",r-ensi,tfr
12,"sorry, she doesn’t live at the store","
all names have been changed for anonymity, including mine.

hello! i’ve been reading a lot of posts about tales from retail, and i thought i’d share a couple of mine :) 
i’m going to share two really short tales from retail. they’re not too crazy, but i thought they were funny. i’ll hopefully be sharing more of my more odd ones in the future.
just a tiny bit of background info: i work at a retail store that sells anything you could need for an outdoor adventure, like camping supplies, coats (i’m from canada in a province where the weather is always changing) hiking backpacks, skis, shoes, etc. 


first story:
i was working at the till, tagging items with hard security tags, when the phone rings. i personally dislike answering phones and am rather awkward, but i try my best. 
the conversation goes as follows:
c=customer

me- “store name” my name’s x, how can i help you?

c-hi! is brenda home?

me- uh, “store name” on 8th, um, how can i help you? 

c- yes. is brenda home?

me- i’m really sorry, i don’t know anyone named brenda *awkwardness rising*

c- oh.. ok. bye

me- *squeaks nervously* have a nice day

eep, phones scare me. but at least not-brenda was nice :)


second story:
this one happened today. again, not too crazy, but i had a little laugh about it.
i was ringing up this nice lady at the till. i was making light conversation, as one does, and this lady starts talking about the shirt she was buying.

c- this one’s grey, not blue. i think i bought a blue one at christmas time. i’m not too sure. maybe if you worked here more frequently you could remember what i bought and could tell me if i had already bought the grey one.

me- *laughs nervously* have a nice day


hope you enjoyed my little stories :)

13,customer shows a different form of holiday spirit,"this happened many years ago, at the height of popularity for factory outlets.

i was working part time for a handbag and luggage store in one of our local malls.  the pay was good, the commissions were generous and the owners - who were relatively local - actually treated their workers pretty decently.  they had several stores in malls around the geographical area as well as owning an outlet version where discontinued/limited quantity stock was sold at a discount to make room for newer items.  the stuff wasn't cheap in the regular stores - we're talking name brand leather handbags and luggage.

when the holiday buying season rolled around (day after thanksgiving to mid-january) the owners gave their part-time employees the chance to pick up extra hours by working some shifts at the outlet store due to the massive influx of holiday shoppers - think hundreds of bus-loads of people coming from surrounding major metropolitan areas daily.  it worked out great for everyone - the owners didn't have to hire new seasonal workers and us employees got extra money.

on this particular day i was bagging for the cashiers.  we were in a square area at the front of the store - the sides were the counters leading to the cash registers (2), the front had wallets and small items and the back had the gate for the employees to get into the square.  the store was bursting to the seams with customers, the floor workers were busting their butts helping the customers find things, and the lines to pay were minimum of 10 people deep on both sides of the cash wrap area.  i was going back and forth between the cashiers bagging the smaller items or stapling the ""paid"" ribbons around the handles of the larger pieces of luggage that weren't baggable.  most of the customers were good - patiently waiting for help and to get rung out.  most of the complaints i heard were about how crowded the store was, not about the service.

enter the entitled customer.  the woman shoved herself between two people waiting in line at the register, threw a red leather handbag at me and yelled ""black!!!!""  i knew what she wanted - i guess she was tired of waiting her turn for the floor staff to help her and expected me to stop what i was doing, run into the stockroom and find that style in black.  but i was under strict orders to stay in the bagging area so that we could keep the lines moving as fast as we could without the cashiers having to stop ringing people up to bag their purchases.  so being the young, smart-ass person that i was at that time, i picked up the bag, looked at it, looked at the lady and said in my sweetest customer service voice, ""no, ma'am.  that's red."" then i tossed the bag into the re-stock bin and kept bagging.  the lady was probably going to say something back at me, but a floor runner showed up quickly to help her.  and yes, we did have the item in black, which she did purchase.

i don't think i will ever forget that incident.",paganbeader53,tfr
14,"yes i speak spanish too, pendeja.","so this is one of my all time favorite stories to tell about my work in retail so far.

so a little info on me, i'm very pale, i don't look very hispanic. in fact my name isnt very hispanic either (so i've been told). so people usually think i'm white until i pull out my fluent spanish.

one slow afternoon i get a lady and her 7 year old son come into my line. she speaks to me in english and i can hear her accent but i have a hard time deciding where her accent is from. since she seems pretty fluent and has no problem understanding me i continue to speak with her in english. i notice that her son is browsing through one of the magazines we sell and i wait to see if she'll say anything to him.

we finish the transaction, i give her her bag, watch her start baghing her items and she has yet to mention the magazine. so i ask her ""ma'am, will you be buying the magazine?""

she looks at it and rippes it out of her kids hands, and i'm thinking 'ah crap she's gonna yell at the kid for grabbing something he shouldn't have' but instead she says, ""ay si, como si fuera a robarme este pinche revista de 3 dollares. pendeja."" which was spanish for ""oh wow im totally gonna steal this stupid 3 dollar magazine. dumbass.""

she tosses it to me and i say, in my sweetest voice, ""bueno, la revista cuesta $13.99..."" which was spanish for ""well, the magazine costs $13.99...""

she looks at me and goes ""ooh no pues wow, hablas español. babosa"" which was ""oh wow, you speak spanish. idiot."" and i say ""parese que si. que tenga un lindo dia."" which was ""looks like i do. have a nice day."" she told me to go fuck myself and left the store.

i used to hate that i didnt look like a 'typical mexican' but i've learned that i can use it to my benefit.",Daddy-kinkshame-me,tfr
15,if i had a miniature pet horse i can i bring it in too?!?!,"so this story isnt as interesting as other retail stories but it traumatized me a little and i laughed about it afterwards. this happened yesterday around 8pm pst

anyway, i work at a \*sarcasm\* high an luxury place that is known for being a bargain market (hint hint) and it was close-ish to closing and there are just people with transactions of a few items, occasional $100 order but nothing out of the ordinary. there is a regular that comes in with the most beautiful dog and we let him in as we feel bad to leave the dog outside as it was raining. as i'm ringing up customer, one points out that there is a dog in the store with no indication that it is a service dog. tdlr at bottom because im lazy.  d= middle aged dude with a miniature pony, k= manager who i think has brain damage and me

d: hey, there's a person with a dog in here

me: oh, i know. he's a regular and its raining. the dog is well behaved so we let him in

d: what no that's not right, there are laws against that, unless its a service dog it shouldn't be in here.

me: well he's a vet so we let him in anyways and we let dogs in all the time as long as they don't cause a disturbance. the managers are cool with it.

d: so are you saying that if the pet is ""behaving"" well it can come in?

me: well, yea if its a dog or a cat (some lady brought in her cat in and just sat inside the cart so i let it slide)

d: well i have a pet miniature horse, can i bring it in?!?!

me: probably not,  you may view it as a pet, it is still considered a farm animal by the state of california so no you can't

d: well then that dog also shouldn't wither because it isnt identified as a service dog. im going to contact the owner of the store^(tm) specifically and report that you let a random dog in. i know him personally

me: i do too

d: \[gets angry and finishes paying\]

oh and i want a bag too (throws a dime in my direction)

me: they're 16 cents each

d gets angry, shoves his stuff into the cart and just leaves

k: what was that about

m: dude got mad about us letting a dog in

k: oh ok. maybe next time just let me handle it so we dont get a bad yelp review

m: {what the actual fuck are you saying} fine

so i talked to the owner and he said he was cool with dogs coming in so hope the dude was ready for some disappointing news.

tldr; customer sees another customer with a dog inside store and gets angry

16,the pen and corporate office number!,"so when i was 18 and fresh out of high school i got a job at a local pet store in the mall. so much stuff happened at the job it taught me about how people really are. 

we had a giant sign at the front of the store posted that said no food and drinks. typically if someone brought in a food or drink you would just ask them not to bring those in and they would begrudgingly leave the store. not these people they were so rude and it was hilarious. 

they were the only people in the store and it was probably around 6 or 7 at night on a weekday. they came in with their drinks and i kindly told them that they can't bring their drinks into the store. this is what ensued:

customer = c
 me = m 
boss lady= b

c: what did you say to me?

m: sir, you can't bring those drinks into the store.

c: ( now screaming) i can bring whatever the fuck i want to into this store.

m: no, you cannot. i will have to ask you to leave. 

c: (comes closer) do you have any idea how much money i spent in this store?

m: i don't care you need to leave now.

c: i want to fucking speak to your manager.

m: i am sorry sir, my manager is on her lunch break.

c: will give me the fucking number to the corporate office. (small business no corporate office)

m: okay sir, whatever you want.

i pull out a business card and begin to write my bosses name on the card. at which point he grads the pen out of my hand and he starts screaming give me the card now. so i hand it out to him and he doesn't take. i am visibly shakened and i toss the card to the counter top and he throws the pen at me and that is when boss lady shows up.

b: did you just throw a pen at my employee.

c: well she threw a business card at me and she's been harassing me.

b: i don't give a fuck what she did to you. do not throw a fucking pen at my fucking employees!

c: do you have any idea how much money i spent with you guys. ( yes this was his go to)

b: my guess is 0. get the hell out of my store before i call the police and press harassment charges on you.

we actually had to call security to drag him out of the store his wife sat there meekly the entire time. my guess he was abusive idk pure speculation.

( this is just the gist of the conversation because that happened 13 years ago)

17,that time that i broke my department,"tldr at bottom.

many years ago, i worked for a family-run chain of department stores. i made it plain to everyone that i was sticking it out, working in crappy retail so that i could earn enough money to go back to college. 

so, the day finally came where i'd scraped together enough money to enroll for a couple of classes. 

i told my department manager and hr the next day at work, and let them know about my new availability. 

this exciting turn of events occurred a few weeks before the annual store-wide inventory. 

every year, i got picked to work on the inventory team. my college classes were scheduled to start at the same time as inventory week, during some of the same hours as the inventory shifts. i knew how stupid (and last-minute) the scheduling could be, so, i made numerous attempts to personally make sure that the assistant store manager and store manager knew about my availability change as well (so that when they had to approve my schedule they understood why my hours were now different and they didn't try to ""fix"" them). 

my assistant store manager was on the ball and was quick to follow-up and recognize my change of availability. the store manager, however, was avoiding me (i stood up to her once and that made me a persona non grata with her). i kept trying to follow up with her and she kept blowing me off/ avoiding me. 

by her conduct, i already knew that she was planning to screw me over.

at that point, college was more important to me than this crappy retail job. i didn't really want to lose income, but i was prepared to walk.

at that time, i worked in a department with a very specialized set of knowledge/ skills. there were at most 3 people in the whole store who could actually man that department- and one person was out on medical leave.

so, as expected, the schedules were released the afternoon of the day before inventory. and, yeah, my schedule didn't reflect my new availability. 

i hauled ass to the offices to see if the assistant store manager or store manager could fix my schedule. 

the wagons were circled now. the assistant store manager seemed to have a case of amnesia and didn't acknowledge that i'd mentioned the availability change- weeks ago. the store manager, as expected, made it out to be my fault that i didn't get her approval for my change of availability. 

so my store manager obviously figured that if she ignored my request that i would make college ""go away"" and stick with this job that was so obviously my desired career in life? okie dokie.

i let her think that she was ""winning"" and worked the first day of inventory (i didn't have classes that day).

i came in the next day and worked inventory until the first rest break (all the inventory workers took a break at the same time). then i put my resignation notice in my department manager's mail box (she was scheduled for a late shift and wasn't in yet), cleared my locker out, and walked off the job (so that i could get to class).

when i got out of class a few hours later, all hell had apparently broken loose at the store.

there were a couple of frantic voicemails on my cellphone from my department manager. she was the only person who could run the department in my absence (since the other worker was out on medical leave), but, the store manager kept department managers so busy with administrative tasks that kept them from working in their own departments that my department manager had no one to run the department after inventory week was over since i walked out. she'd gotten my resignation note, had a private flip-out in the stockroom, and made a beeline for the offices to let them know how screwed her department now was. she flat-out told the store manager that i couldn't be allowed to quit. a later message from her instructed me to expect a call from hr, offering to re-hire me. 

i was perversely amused- i liked my department manager and felt bad about quitting on her, but knowing that the store manager was showing herself to be a proven idiot made my day.

i went to my next class.

after that class ended a few hours later, there was a voicemail from hr, offering to rehire me.

i called back.

the store manager was having her revenge on me now- hr offered to rehire me, but part-time and in a different department (so, obviously, she was having revenge on my old department manager as well). 

i was fine with part-time- if they'd bothered to recognize my availability change that i submitted a few weeks previously, i'd asked for reduced hours. plus, the new job was in a department i'd worked in before. 

i accepted the offer and immediately began looking for a better job- i knew that the store manager was going to find new and exciting ways to torment me the longer that i stayed. 

&amp;#x200b;

tldr- my store manager thinks that by ignoring my notification that i am returning to college, that i will begrudgingly pick a crappy retail job over school. she was wrong.

18,having a sense of humor with shoplifters.,"i'm typing on a tablet that tends to glitch and crash so i may have to post and edit in the middle.  thanks for your patience.

many years ago, i used to work in a dime store that is now long gone.  one of our frequent challenges was dealing with shoplifters.

i was working the cash register when an employee came out of the stockroom to give me the heads up about spotting shoplifters.  what these shoplifters were doing was stuffing merchandise inside other merchandise, which is a no-no.  their goal was to get away with stealing whatever they could without getting caught.

anyway, the shoplifters came to my register, plunked their basket down, and pointedly told me not to touch it!  (yeah!  right!)  then the shoplifters went elsewhere to where i couldn't see them but a co-worker could observe any more shoplifting attempts without being spotted.  while the shoplifters were busy elsewhere, i went ahead and pulled everything out of their basket and pulled out all the merchandise they were planning on stealing.  i stacked their planned purchases very neatly and arranged what they planned to steal right on top!  then i sat back and waited while my supervisor hid and watched the fun.

the shoplifters came back and started to comment about some other merchandise but stopped in mid-sentence when they realized their game was up!  all they could do was stand in front of me imitating a goldfish!  i asked, ""is there a problem?""  i heard my supervisor giggling like mad and the shoplifters turn all shades of red!

it was fun to watch!  :-) ",JustanOldBabyBoomer,tfr
19,more complaining shoplifters,"in my store, the one that’s all ages fun in the front, and adult party time in the back, i’ve established a policy regarding shoplifting kids: if you come in with someone who then tries to steal from us, your ass is bounced as well. your buddy is bounced permanently, you’re bounced for the day. unless you do something stupid...

in this tale, my junior manager is the star. she had her suspicions about a group of young guys walking through the back of the store, so she kept an eye on them, and then checked the cameras. one of them grabbed a love ring and slipped it into his sweatshirt pocket. following my policy, she grabbed another one from the floor and confronted them.

‘you stuck one of these in your pocket. can i have it back, please?”

he denied it, she repeated the offer more loudly, then told the associate working to call mall security for backup. at that point he handed back the love ring, so she then asked for the entire group to leave the store. the one that stole left, but the rest fought it.

“we didn’t do anything. why do we have to leave?”

“because you were accomplices to his theft, and i’m asking you to.”

one of them sees a sign now featured on our counter asking about your experience in the store, and offering a number to call with compliments and complaints. the kid pulls his phone, and calls the customer service line to complain that my junior manager was being rude to them. she managed to get them out of the store, and while i highly doubt that our customer service people will take them seriously, i still expect a phone call from my district manager on monday...",ecowfer13,tfr
20,apparently retail workers are your slaves,"this is a short one but it happened to me today and i felt like i had to share it.

i work in a store that sells women's clothes and accessories. 
i was assigned to the footwear section for the day. doing stock, cleaning up and what have you. as i was going about my day, everything was going good, i come around the corner and see these 2 grown women trying on dresses over their clothes... at first it confused me because we have changing rooms but maybe they just didn't have the time or something i don't know. anyway, as i went to approach them to see if they needed any help with anything they walked away before i could even get a word out and left a dress on the bench. i picked it up, put it back on the hanger and hung it back where it belongs. no biggie. that was until... i looked over and saw about 5 dresses thrown over one of my shoe stands and 2 pairs of shorts also thrown on top of it. i can only assume the mess belonged to the ladies that just walked away as i saw them trying on dresses.
it imidiately annoyed me, why would you just throw it over a rack where it clearly doesn't even belong? what is wrong with people. i don't get what's so hard about putting stuff back where you found out, especially when you're like 5 feet from the original location. how lazy do you have to be. do people really have the mindset of ""not my job, i don't have to pick it up"" mentality?

21,can’t you read?,"there’s been plenty of times where i’ve been on the morning or evening shift at the shop i work at, and there’s always at least two people who turn up half an hour before or after we’ve closed. they’ll try to open the door, and when it won’t budge they’ll knock to get our attention. at this point you can see them getting agitated.  all i do is shake my head and point to the opening times in the window, which is right. next. to.  the.  door. 

it baffles me, because some of them have the cheek to check the time we open/close after i point it out, then check their phone or watch, and still try to ask to be let in!

22,mad kid goes on a rampage,"this is my first post on here, but a kid going mad seems fitting for this sub.

(no conversations because this was a few years ago and i can't remember anything)

&amp;#x200b;

so i'd been going around town, desperately searching for a new job. i managed to get a trial shift at small shop and was very pleased. naive, 16 year old me, thought this would all go okay, despite not ever working in retail before. my day started out okay. it was the height of summer in a tourist town, so the shop was already packed by the time i got there, with a huge number of kids due to the contents of the store. everything was going fine until this one kid, maybe 2 or 3 years old, started getting stressed about which thing to get. of course, he wanted the expensive things or more, but his mum wouldn't let him. once his mum made a decision for him, he started getting angry and refused to leave the store. from there, he began screaming and running around. we all tried talking to him, but no one could even get close. eventually we had to close the store, as it was only little and he was causing chaos in the whole place. at his peak he managed to knock over multiple displays of pen pots etc, break 3 glass picture frames, and push our stereo over (luckily not breaking it.) this all tired him out so he eventually sat down and gave up and his mum carried him away.

here's the positive part. later, his mum came back on her own and explained he had had a long day on the beach and was very tired. apparently he went to sleep as soon as they got to the car. she even gave us a pack of beer as a thank you!

surprisingly, i went back to get that job. turned out i just had an unlucky day, but i've got so many stories like this...",caketreesmoothie,tfr
23,"home-brought items are mixed up, parents milk the incident from me but refuse any kind of help i offer","new here, i hope this is the right sub! 

i work as a manager at a children’s birthday facility. the birthday parties end with food and gift giving, and often times the hosts will bring in some snacks like chips to go along with the food they’ve ordered from us. we always label their items the host has brought in, so that their “server” of sorts knows what is theirs.

anyway, tonight i’m closing and take my 30 in the back room while the second shift manager stays up front. i come back around 7:30 pm, our last party has already arrived at 7 while i was on break. around 7:45 pm their “server” (an employee) comes up to the front desk and tells me that her party hosts stuff was mislabeled, and was being used for a different party. she says they took their gift bags and chips/salsa, and that she was able to take back the gift bags before anyone touched them, but the chips/salsa were already opened.

i try to figure out why their stuff was mislabeled but can’t get an answer from my staff, so i just go talk to the host of the party who’s chips/salsa were taken from. i apologize to him and tell him that i’ve discounted their bill after i heard about the mishap, to which he says that isn’t sufficient for the lost food. i tell him that i can also offer him free food from our kitchen along with the discount, and that again i apologize for the mistake. he says he doesn’t want the free food, and he’ll talk to me later. so i say alrigh and go call my boss, the owner of the business. 

he tells me what i offered was more than enough, so i leave it at that. 

an hour later the host dad comes up to pay. i show him his bill with the discount, and he tells me it’s “insulting to him” and that he doesn’t want a discount at all. he insists i take it off. i do, but i ask him what more i could have done to remedy the situation aside from apologize and offer alternatives. his wife chimes in at this point and says that “it’s not about the food. it’s the principle of it. it’s their daughters special day!” and at this point you guys... i’m tired, i’ve tried everything, and honestly it’s a fucking bag of chips and a container salsa. and it didn’t even happen while i was on the clock. i say, again, “i understand and apologize but i’m now a little confused as to what you want from me.”

the dad says he wants nothing, but that he and all of his friends who heard me offer the discount felt i was insincere and insulting to offer it. i told him that i genuinely wanted to make sure he heard from me face to face so that he knew i was trying to fix the situation asap, and didn’t mean to insult him by speaking to him (that’s kind of my job). he said he would have rather i not said anything (???) and that it doesn’t matter, i’ll be “hearing all about it on social media.” 

i say “okay, i don’t know what you want from me at this point but i’ll go ahead and remove the discount.” i informed him that the owner will be contacting him too. he tells me that’s fine, and that he made sure to tip his “server” because she was fantastic. 

i said “i’m happy to hear that and i’ll let her know.” and that was...it. it was one of the few times in my life that i’ve ever encountered someone so hellbent on being unhappy no matter what i tried to do. even after asking them what i could do for them, they never answered me. and now they’re going to tell my boss that i was insulting and insincere and they’re going to blast me on social media because i tried to fix something that happened not even on my watch, while i was on my break. 

that’s all. i’m just upset. usually parents don’t get to me but this one was so personal. i didn’t even make the mistake. ugh. anyway, i just needed to get that off my chest.

24,"""my package didn't get there and it's your fault""","before i start i just wanna say sorry i'm on mobile and i didn't know where to post it so i'll put it here for now. this might be a little fuzzy cause it happened almost a year ago.

a bit of backstory:
so i work at a shipping store/bill pay/retail store. we pretty much do everything a store probably can. the owner of the store is an absentee owner and has asked us not to give out any information on him (this is important later). we are located on the border of the not so good part of town and the good part. besides me, there are only two people who work in the store. this is also while a hurricane went through the carolinas.

rl: rude lady
m: manager
me: me

i was in the middle of taping up some boxes when i see a lady come in with i'm guessing a family friend? i go up to the counter and start helping her. she tells me she wants to ship her husbands hearing aid back to him cause he has some appointment the day after next that he can't miss. uhm okay? when i see it's going to one of the carolinas i look back up at her and tell her that it might get delayed due to weather.

rl: no it's clear there. it should be fine.

i look back at my manager and ask her if the zip code was on the list when she looked it up she told me it wasn't but then told the lady it might still be delayed due to other delayed packages.

rl: well it should be there on time, right?

me: uhm, there is a good possibility but i can't guarantee anything due to the hurricane.

she went through with shipping it anyways. she even insured it for about how much it would cost to replace. 

fast forward a week or so, my manager and i stayed after work for a few hours so i could help her clean.
this number keeps calling the work number so my manager answered the call to see why they were trying so desperately to get in contact with us. its the lady and she isn't very happy. now, this is going off of what my manager told me as i couldn't get to the other phone to listen in (sad, i know). apparently, the package didn't get there the next day, it arrived a day after. now decent people would've been happy with the fact it still arrived. she was not. she messed up her story saying my manager was the one to help her, not me. she kept demanding a full refund of what she paid. when my manager said all she could do was file a claim with fedex and them turn it down since it technically got to said destination, the lady flipped and hung up on my manager. we thought that was that.

ten or so minutes later she calls back. she tried to get the owner's name and his contact information.

m: i'm sorry ma'am but i cannot give you his information.

i don't know what she said after but i imagine it was along the lines of asking why not because my manager replies with this.

m: he is an absentee owner and he doesn't want his information released.

she then threatens to call her lawyer and threatens to sue us.

m: okay ma'am because you brought in a lawyer this is where our conversation ends, have a lovely night.

and she hangs up on the lady! she rants to me about it for a little and after twenty minutes or so i check the business email on one of the desktops... she posted a review on google and gave us one star. she complained about how her package came one day after the ""guaranteed date"" on the receipt and how we shouldn't say it was guaranteed when it wasn't and that my manager hung up on her twice. i read it out for my manager and then looked at her.

me: please let me respond to her.

m: fine but be formal with it. 

me: you betcha.

i sit there and write a paragraph responding to hers about how the receipt says ""expected arrival"" and how we are also trained to not say guaranteed because nothing can be. there is always room for human error. i then let her know if she wants, she can come in and get a fresh copy of the receipt. i also tell her that my manager did indeed hang up on her the last phone call because she threatened to bring in a lawyer. we never heard back from the lady and we never got sued. 


edit: here is the review. i have to edit it for obvious reasons.

""quoted prices by [my manager's name here], september 19th, to send a package to sc, as i had asked their expert opinion on getting it there as quickly as possible, with them or postal office, and she assured me fed ex cleared it, as the area had no flooding. paid fee with full insurance and an additional fee for signed delivery two days guaranteed service. it arrived on the third day. i called left message with [name of my store here], and got no response. i called back today, and [my manager's name here] was unprofessional and extremely rude, refused to listen to me, practically called me a liar and refused to give out the owner’s name or contact information.”he doesn’t want this given out, his name or phone number.” she hung up on me twice. in the future, i will be using another service. the inconvenience of losing an additional day of work and hearing for my husband that can never be measured by dollar values. customer service includes behavior. the receipt has ‘guaranteed delivery ‘ printed on it.""

and my response is this.

""dear mrs. rude lady,
the receipt has ""expected arrival"". we do not guarantee anything just for this reason. we will be more than happy to provide you with a fresh receipt if you desire one. the worker you were with (who was also trained to not guarantee any time period) said she couldn't guarantee any date due to the bad weather in that area. as for the manager assuring that it was cleared, it was fedex who cleared the zip code, but there were also backed-up packages from when it wasn't cleared. the manager did hang up a second time once you threatened to call a lawyer.""",onesaltygirl,tfr

26,camouflage does it’s job (customer can’t find her own shirt - blames us),"i work at a women’s clothing store in an area with a high percentage of wealthy suburban mom types. yesterday we had a pair of ladies in the store who weren’t the nicest, but they weren’t being outwardly mean either. i could overhear them trash talking the clothes in the fitting room, but you know, to each their own right? 

anyways, a little context, our fitting room is at the back of the store and we take all the unprocessed clothes out to a rack and two bins by the cash wrap to process. the whole store is organized by type of clothes (yoga, swim, running, travel, etc) and everything is sorted into neat and organized piles. we keep it very clean and organized during the day.

so all of a sudden the employee working the fitting room comes out to me at the processing rack and says “have you seen a camo shirt accidentally come through? one of our customers can’t find the shirt she wore in.” now i haven’t seen it, and also it’s a slow as heck day and i have maybe 20 items of clothing in my bin so there’s not much to check. nope, not there. out comes camo lady (cl). 

cl: [announcing to the whole store] has anyone seen my camo shirt?!?

i ask her politely if she’s checked her fitting room, her purse, and her other shopping bag. she insists that “of course” she’s already checked there and we “must have done something” with her shirt. she’s now instructing us to look under all our tables and triple check the processing area. 

cl: “i have somewhere to be this is ridiculous.”

we’re all running around looking for her shirt, but it’s nowhere to be found. i offer to take her phone number so she can get to her important place and we can call her if it turns up later. she’s now adamantly insisting that we have placed her (very worn and not our brand) camo shirt on a rack somewhere with our bathing suits or athletic clothes. finally i convince her to give me her phone number and she leaves in a huff. 

fast forward about 20-30 minutes, and i find her camo shirt in her fitting room, wadded up in a ball on the floor. we give her a call - no answer, full inbox. an hour later she calls us and my manager (m) that was on break when all this went down answers the call. 

m: yeah we found your shirt! it was in the fitting room. 

cl: well thats impossible. i looked there. i need you to ship it to me. 

m: well, we can’t ship your own shirt to you but we can hold onto it here for you as long as you need so you can pick it up. 

at this point cl was so angry that she refused to speak. my manager sat on the phone in silence with her for a bit before going “hello? hello?” and hanging up. she still hasn’t called back. 

also, she didn’t buy anything at the store. of course. 

tl;dr lady drops her camo shirt in her fitting room, doesn’t see it, and insists we purposely lost it. later on after she leaves and we find the shirt she insists that we pay shipping to send it to her so she doesn’t have to come back and get it. ",cduerksie,tfr
27,"""stop talking and start working!""","context: so i work at a popular fast fashion store and this happened while i was on the cash register. one lady put down a big pile of clothes on the counter so i scanned them and she paid for them, but as i was folding them and putting them in the bag for her, i noticed that there was one item (socks) that i accidentally didnt scan because it was under the other clothes and it was pretty small so i didnt notice that it was there. i also double checked the receipt i gave her and it wasnt there.
 
me: oh im so sorry, i didnt realize that these socks were here because they were hidden underneath everything whoops!! im really sorry about this but im just gonna have to scan it and have you pay for it on another transaction since i missed it originally.

customer: so...you mean.....i have to...do the transaction ...all over again?

me: oh no don't worry all you have to do is insert your card one more time now to pay for just this one item! once again, im so sorry about this.

customer: well then you need to stop talking and start working. 

at this point i was really confused because i was being really nice to her and i dont get what goes through peoples minds tbh...  i just went quiet and at the end i said ""thank you, have a good day!!!"" to which she gave me a dirty look and walked away quietly lol i dont know who hurt her  ?

28,of paper birds,"hey guys. it's the op that posted the transformers tattoo story back again. if you haven't read that one first i highly recommend it (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromretail/comments/8mpkw6/worth_the_retail_horrors/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
thought i'd share another story. i'm on mobile so shoot me.


before i start this story there's some important backstory that we need to address, which i know, it sucks. but, onwards. i do crafts quite often. but the two things i tend to do the most, and since high school, is origami and making jewelry. now, in high school in my junior year i went through some traumatic stuff that i won't delve too deep into since i dont want to make this longer than i need to. at the time i decided to be childish and, remembering the story about the little girl who tried to make a thousand cranes to gain a wish, began to make paper cranes all the time. seriously, they were everywhere. i also have extreme adhd which is also important. 

i've since moved up in the world from a cashier to a self checkout attendant. now, i love doing self checkout. i enjoy it the most and feel like i get to talk to people and get to know them a bit better than in a check stand. but it can also get chaotic. i also tend to sometimes forget to take my adhd medication so i can get a bit fidgety when it gets a bit on the slower side of things. we recently got a new self checkout cluster and moved the old ones to the other side of the store since we have entrances on both sides of the door. we refer to them as a and b cluster. a being the side the old ones were at and b being the side they are at now. i was tending to the b side, which is often the slower side, and had forgotten to take my meds once again. so i decided to say ""screw it."" and grabbed a post it/sticky note.


three of my managers are super chill with my adhd tendencies as long as i'm getting work done and on this particular day my favorite one was there so he didn't care that i was about to explode origami everywhere. and holy hell did i. they were all over the little station we call pay stations. they're a little check stand with a monitor for just us. anyways, i was getting bored with just making the normal cranes so i decided to challenge myself further and see if i could remember how to make the cranes that flapped their wings if you pulled their tail. i made sure everybody was good and began working on it, completely oblivious to the little eyes watching me battle this sticky note. it wasn't until i hear a little voice that i nearly fumbled the paper.


lg (little girl): watcha making?


me: oh! i'm making a crane.


at that moment i finished and bent down to her level while praying i didn't screw up a fold.


me: he even flies, see? (pulls the crane's tail and he thankfully flaps his wings)


lg: woah


me: here you can have him.


lg: thank you! (runs over to her mom at one of the checkout stands and begins tugging on his tail like i did while swinging him around) look momma! he's flying!


the mom thanked me for the little gift and i told her it was no problem really. it probably didn't last long but hey, i dont mind. i gave out some regular cranes to kids that day but she was the only one that got a flapping crane. man, sometimes working retail is worth the hell.

29,difficult and borderline condescending customer.,"i need a good rant. i work in a furniture and flooring store as an interior designer. i’ve been doing my job for nearly 10 years, and i’m not bragging when i say i’m good with colour. my boss hired me because of this, but apparently that doesn’t mean a lot this particular lady buying a sofa. 

this lady wants my help, in fact, she needs me to tell her what looks good. we have to pick a fabric for the sofa, and a fabric for the pillows that will go with it. so, as i always do, i narrow down our selection to a few options and get her opinion. normally this works well, hence why i always do this, and the customer can either pick one of the options and be on their way, or we make some changes. 

not this woman. she leans toward a particular option, but will it look good? yes it certainly will. i’m not in the business of making homes look like a drunken college student shopping at leon’s put it together. 

“are you sure”

“yes! it’ll look great together!”

“i don’t think those fabrics work together.” 

alrighty. fine. “customer is right”, and i’m not a tyrant. i want you to be happy with your selection. back to the fabrics. 

this happens a few more times, all the while small comments here and there questioning my abilities to perceive colour, yet pleading with me to choose something. i keep choosing things, she keeps saying they don’t work. she’s literally seeing colours that aren’t there. 

there is this thing that happens to your eyesight as you get old, and it’s called the “ginger ale effect”. you’ll get a yellow tinge to your sight, and of course you won’t see colours the way the general public does. that’s what i think this lady has. i have proof! 

i’m carefully looking at three, very similar fabrics. the shade difference is slight, but it’s there and i say “i would go with this one, because the other two have a slight green tone to them, and they don’t work.”

she looks me in the eyes, and with a smirk that says, “i knew it!” she goes, “your eyes are green.”

1) my eyes are fucking blue
2) what does the colour of my iris have to do with how the inside of my eye and brain see colour?!!?!?? 

and this is during another appointment with an equally infuriating customer, but that’s another story altogether. 

thank you for listening. i want to go home. ",elle5624,tfr
30,math in the morning is hard.," i'd just like to start by saying that i am not a morning person....at all. i work the saturday morning shift at the local post office.

today i roll into work, still groggy as usual. i open up the post office and a minute or two later, this dude comes in with a letter to send, asking if it needs more postage. i look at his letter, and it has a few older stamps with odd denominations on them. knowing my sleepy brain, my shoddy basic math skills, and before really looking at the stamps, i tell the guy that i need to grab my calculator to figure it out. calculator in hand, i inspect the stamps. first one is 49c, so i type that into the calculator. second one is 50c, so into the calculator it goes. third and final stamp is... oh... also 50c. ""i guess that's $1.49"" i say sheepishly. the amused look on his face didn't help the cringe i was feeling.

as if i didn't already look like an idiot, i managed to push all of the wrong buttons on the cash register when trying to ring in his additional postage, to the point where i had to cancel the transaction and start over again. i can only hope that the guy thought i was just learning my job. i'm not, i've been there for 6 years, but like i said, i'm not a morning person.",grrlb0t,tfr
31,"yes, lady, we're definitely committing attempted murder to get you to come back.","these days i work at **[redacted]** in the auto care center. the other night i was working a normal shift on an otherwise normal day. a customer had come through and gotten a tire replaced; i didn't know the full situation at the time, but it was apparently covered under the road hazard warranty and as such she got a free tire. fairly normal stuff.

a few hours later, i'm straightening my aisles while the guys in the shop are wrapping up the last few vehicles out in the bay. i get a call on my phone from the manager's office needing to speak with one of the shop techs. after i get one and he takes the call, he informs me of what went down. the lady from earlier had just gotten her third tire under the road hazard warranty; the previous two tires replaced both had non-repairable sidewall damage in the same spot on the car, so they were replaced free of charge. the service manager had spitballed some ideas on what could be happening to cause this to happen, throwing off ideas like ""maybe you've hit the same thing in the road more than once?"" or ""maybe someone could be trying to slash your tires?"" i don't know how plausible those were, but clearly something is causing this very specific damage to keep happening to the same tire in the same spot.

the lady, upon hearing that second idea, goes home and calls management to insinuate that maybe one of our shop techs is slashing her tires to drum up more business! i immediately busted out laughing like a madman and nearly fell over behind the counter at the absolute stupidity of such a statement. i could just say she's overly paranoid if her half-brained idea made any sense at all, but she got two **free** tires! so, no, we're not committing felonies to cost ourselves more money, lady, but i thank you for the laughs that i sorely needed.",IdiotaRandoma,tfr
32,magnets can be hazardous to one's health.,"so this was a few years back, when i worked in the electronics department of a certain large retailer.

as you may or may not know, many retailers put some of the more expensive movies in plastic locking boxes. when you checkout, the cashier uses a large bar magnet to open the plastic box. pretty simple theft deterrent.

on this particular evening, it was me and one other person manning the electronics desk. normally we would each have a bar magnet on a key-chain that we would wear on our belt loops, but fairly recently the loop on both of the magnets had busted off so we were just carrying them in our pockets.

fast forward to about 8 or 9, and my coworker takes off, giving me his keys and also his magnet. now i have two of these large magnets in my pocket.

i'm milling about the department, putting movies in their plastic boxes, when a couple comes up to my desk to buy a few items. no big deal. i slip my bar magnet in my front shirt pocket and begin to ring them up.

the last item i grab to scan is one of those movies in plastic lock-boxes i mentioned. good thing i've got two magnets right? i grab the second magnet that's in my pants pocket, and take the movie out of it's box. then i take that magnet and put it in the same shirt pocket i put the other one. 

huge mistake.

instantly the two magnets snap together, right on my nipple. i'm screaming internally at the magnetic titty twister that i'm recieving, but at the same time i don't want to cause a scene or anything... so i finish ringing the couple up. with my nipple still clamped. surely they had to know something was up because of my facial expression, but they said nothing as i handed them their reciept and wished them a good rest of their night.

the second they walked away from the desk i reach into my pocket and pry the two magnets apart, which was honestly pretty difficult with the two of them wedged into a small pocket. as soon as i free my poor nipple, i feel blood start to run down my chest. great.

i head to the employee bathroom and take my shirt off. sure enough, i had split my nipple open pretty good. i wash myself off with the sink and put a bandaid over it. good enough i guess. i head back to my department and try to forget what i just did to myself, but every move i make is pure agony. the slightest movement of my shirt against my battle wound just sends daggers of pain shooting across my chest.

i literally make it about 15 minutes, before i throw in the towel. i go find the manager on duty and explain what happened. they stifle a laugh and tell me that it's fine if i have to go home. 

now this was my friday, so i spend the rest of the weekend freaking out that they're going to make me fill out an accident report, which involves a possible drug test. one that i would surely not pass. luckilly for me, there was no report. i did get endless shit for the rest of the time i worked there as the guy with half a nipple.

even to this day, 5 or 6 years later that nipple chafes very easilly, and i have a healthy respect for the power of magnets.

i was passing by the hardware aisles when i noticed a guy standing around with the oh so familiar ""i have no idea what i'm doing but i'm too proud to ask for help so i'm just going to stand here until someone asks me what i need"" expression. so i walked over and asked him. he will be crazy guy (cg) and i will be m.


&gt;m: hi! do you need any help with anything?

&gt;cg: i need a circular sawblade for my trimmer.

&gt;m: oh, those will be over by the lawnmowers! i can take you there.

&gt;cg: nah, i fixed this up myself and i want a big blade so i can cut my grass real quick.


i paused and thought. maybe i'd misheard. maybe he misspoke. no one can be crazy enough to mod their weed wacker with sawblades, right?


&gt;m: so you... modded your weed wacker? and now you want to attach sawblades to it?

&gt;cg: yeah.


yep. someone is that crazy. wackers with sawblades are a thing though, so maybe he knew what he was doing. i lead him along the aisle to the blades and begin to search.


&gt;m: do you know the diameter of your protective cover? if the blade is bigger it won't-

&gt;cg: i took the cover off. i don't need no cover i'm trying to get my grass cut quick.


i looked at him. it had to be a joke. his disgruntled expression told me that no, it wasn't a joke.


&gt;m: uhm... well we have some three inch-

&gt;cg: what's the biggest blade you got?


at this point i considered my options. i really didn't want to be partially responsible for some idiot's death. but i also knew he wouldn't leave without his damn blade.


&gt;me: well honestly i can't condone using a sawblade on a modded wacker without a guard. that is extremely dangerous. but this 10 inch 60 tooth over here should do the job.

&gt;cg: this'll cut my grass?

&gt;me, externally: it'll cut wood. i have no doubt it'll cut grass.

&gt;me, internally: and bone and muscle.

cg bought his blades and went on his merry way. i've been looking at the news every so often for any freak accidents involving weed wackers.

first call: hello? hello? can't quite hear you. can you speak up? how about just leave your..
his hands up to call back thinking it's a phone problem.
second call: hello? hello? can't quite hear you. can you speak up? how about just leave your... 
he hangs up to try on his cell phone. i mean, he didn't see the similarities i guess.
third try, gets all the way to telling us to leave our name and number.
he hung up.

35,"rude old lady ruins my night, nice lady makes it all better","i work at a very small grocery/specialty store. at the moment a lot of our stock is missing because our boss doesn’t (or can’t) pay for the orders. even when he does, the orders are coming from outside the country so they take a while to come into our store. 

enter rude old lady (rol) and her daughter (i think). they’re looking for a type of chocolate that we unfortunately don’t have in stock right now. rol says “psh, of course you don’t”. i smile and apologize, then walk away because, what do you want me to do?? we just don’t have it, sorry. 

rol comes to the cash with some items and as i’m ringing her up she says to me, “you have less and less stock, you need to step it up with the orders”. she’s scowling right at me and i’m instantly flustered.

i get it. it’s very frustrating when you’re looking for something in a store and it’s just not there. but maybe if you were just a little bit nice to me and not a total nightmare every time you come in i’d try to help you by reserving the item for you. but i digress. 

so i say to her, “i’m sorry we didn’t have what you’re looking for. we’re just waiting on some orders to come in.” rol is pretty much done with me and snatches her bag from me and says, “yeah sure, that’s what you say all the time.” finally, she leaves. 

enter nice lady (nl) with her adorable and sweet son. she says, loud enough for rol to hear as she’s walking out the door, “she was so rude to you, unbelievable.” rol didn’t even look back, but i heard the door slam on her way out.

i thanked nl for sympathizing with me, and i let her son have some extra candy from our dish.

36,what's a throat plunger?,"at time of posting, this happened 5 hours ago, a little after 4am. i work the night shift, so there aren't many employees around at the time i work. at that time, i was busy stocking toothbrushes and deodorant.

&amp;#x200b;

a ratty-looking woman came into the aisle and immediately shouted at me. ""hey! i need help finding something, and i can't find anybody in this d\*mn store to help me!""

&amp;#x200b;

i was tired and just trying to focus on my task, but i had to be nice. ""i'm sorry we don't have many employees here at night, but i can try my best to help you, ma'am.""

&amp;#x200b;

the ratty woman pointed aggressively at my face.""i don't give a f\*ck! just tell me where i can find what i need!""

&amp;#x200b;

""what are you looking for?"" i asked.

&amp;#x200b;

""i'm looking for a plunger!"" she kept yelling, despite being just about 2 feet away from me at that point.""but it's a plunger thing for a baby's throat! for when they're sick!""

&amp;#x200b;

i was confused because i had never seen anything like that.""do you know the brand name or what it's called?""

&amp;#x200b;

""you're supposed to know this sh\*t! it's a plunger for a baby's throat!"" she was getting louder and rather frustrated at me. ""it has a long tube on it!"" she made a plunging motion with her hand near her throat.""you use it like this!""

&amp;#x200b;

i was only getting more confused. like, tf is a throat plunger? ""i'm sorry, but i don't know what that is. have you checked the children's cold and flu aisle? or perhaps our infant department?""

&amp;#x200b;

the woman glared at me.""i already checked! and i don't want to go to the infants area cause there are no people there to help me!""

&amp;#x200b;

""i can walk over there to help you look for what you need."" as i offered this, the woman huffed and stormed out of the aisle. i got back to my task. if she didn't want my help, i wasn't going to chase her down.

&amp;#x200b;

about only 2 or 3 minutes later, she came back into the aisle and stomped right up to me. in her hand was a small orange box of children's ibuprofen that also contains a little plastic syringe for measuring liquid medicine, which she thrust into my face, nearly hitting me with it.""this is what i was looking for! so now you know for next time when a customer is looking for this at 2 in the f\*cking morning!""

&amp;#x200b;

i was annoyed and dumbfounded. like, lady, you said plunger. that's not a plunger. and it's 4 o'clock, not 2. she called me an idiot and stormed away again. i was ticked off, so i decided that was a good time to take my last break. ",Unicoruppy,tfr
37,“next time tell that b***ard to put it in my hair!”,"i used to work at a gas station a few years ago, so obviously we got a lot of questionable people coming in on a regular basis. but there was this one woman who we just called crazy lady (mean, i know but it was a well deserved nickname.) that takes the gold for craziest customer i have ever seen. this isn’t the most insane story involving her, but it’s my favorite to tell.

so my shift had just ended and i was buying a few things while chatting with a coworker, i’ll call him steve. while he was ringing me up crazy lady bursts through the door, slams $4 down on the counter and rudely tells him to put it on the pump she was at. we were kind of used to her at this point so we just roll our eyes, steve suspends my transaction so he can put the money on her pump then goes back to ringing me out.

i had just swiped my card when we see crazy lady rushing back to the store. we share an “oh god what now?” look. she looked extremely upset as she once again slams the door open and says “i gave you $4!” 

steve and i share a confused look and he looks down at the monitor (where it shows the pumps in use, and the amount being pumped.) before he replies with “yes ma’am, i put that on your pump.” 

crazy lady snaps back with “no you didn’t! it only said $1.67! i gave you $4 not $1.67!”

now, our pumps had a habit of freezing from time to time while fuel was being pumped, but it was never for more than a couple of seconds, so i can only assume that her pump froze and she took it as being done without actually waiting to see if it was. steve again looked down at the monitor to see that all $4 had indeed been pumped. he explains to her that sometimes our pumps froze up and if she went back outside, she would see that all $4 had been pumped. 

she replies with “it f***king better be!”. she started to turn around when something on the counter catches her eye, she adds (still extremely aggressively) “did you guys get my application?” again, we have no idea what she’s talking about. 

steve asks her “what application?” and she gets even more upset 

“for the credit card!” she screams, pointing to the fuel rewards cards we kept on the counter for customers. “i put in an application and nobody ever got back to me!”

in order to activate your rewards card you have to register it online. but it’s just a rewards card that saves you money on gas and other items in the store if you come in a lot, not a credit card. steve explains as much and says that her rewards card should be good to go if she registered it online.

crazy lady huffs, rolls her eyes and snaps “i guess i’ll need another one of these then!” snatching a card from the counter. she takes two steps out the door before she whirls around, pushes the door back open and screams “and next time tell that ba***rd to put it in my hair!” 

steve and i just stand there speechless for a few moments wondering what the f**k just happened before we burst out laughing. 

i absolutely hated that job, but having stories like these to share almost made it worth is.

side note: we saw after she pulled away that the pump she had used was still showing that it was in use, despite it being done pumping. i walked out to see that the nozzle was on the ground, a puddle of gasoline surrounding it. apparently when she came in to scream at us she had dropped the pump, but left it pumping. so everything after that $1.67 that she saw spilled out onto the ground.",AnotherLazynpc,tfr

typically here, you pick a line and wait. another guy shows up (sleeveless t shirt guy), and asks which line he is waiting in. tie guy says whichever one opens up first. sleeveless guy says, ""that's not how it works, you pick one."" 

tie guy says he'll do what he wants, and swears at sleeveless guy. sleeveless guy proceeds to say fuck you and then delivers a throat punch to tie guy.

tie guy puts his basket down and leaves, and now i'm stuck ringing up the throat puncher. you'd think it was over then. 

wrong.

39,guy returns his old phone and gets arrested for drugs,"this happened a while ago, and i haven't been able to post it until now. 
a guy came in to return a phone because he said it wouldn't activate, so i did a return on it and once he leaves i open it and find out he had exchanged his old phone for the new one. 
me and my boss were not too happy with this, because we couldnt resell and obviously used phone. so we decided to wait for the guy to come back to tell him he would not be allowed back in here for stealing our new phone to replace with an old one. but then i saw the battery was still in the box, a d decided to put it back in. low and behold the phone came on! not only that, but it had a lockscreen, added bonus it didnt have a lock on it.
i swipe up on it and found it was still logged into the guys facebook, where we found his name and that he was buying meth from a friend and multiple other drugs. then we went through his messages, found more drug exchange talks and a message of him saying he would exchange his old phone for his new one and get the money for the new one back. 
we called the police, showed them everything, and was called later saying he was arrested and once he was free, he was not allowed back into our store. this was the most satisfying thing in the world, especially since the store i work at gets items stolen from all the time.

nb: is nice boss
ie: is innocent employ (feel bad they got brought into that)
me: is you can guess

rm: man i should deck you.

that immediately woke me up and i look to the costumer who would have been next if not for the old man and he looks annoyed (apparently while we were detracted the old man i was ringing up walked up and cut everyone.) as i finished the transaction he comes up with his cart.

me: i'm sorry sir? what did you say?

rm: i said i should knock you out for f***ing checking him out before us were here waiting and he just walks and gets his order? that's just fucking rude right?

he then looks at the costumer behind him and she just looks she doesn't want to be apart of this so she just mumbles something before looking away.

me: sorry sir i-

rm: no you don't get it, my time is important i got work to f***ing get to and your wasting my time, i should deck you but your lucky i'm more mature than that.

he starts ranting and im already done with this while he is saying things like ""i got kids to raise"" and how he should ""kick my a**"" all the while screaming how the old man was probably and alcoholic, at this point he sees the person running self-check out and points to her and does this one finger ""come here"" motion (with a grin like he was going to have me groveling on my knees before this is over.) she walks over.

ie: what seems to be the problem sir?

she sees me and she can tell i had my ""i no longer care"" face on and the man starts letting her have it how i was a bad employee and questioning how they hire someone as stupid as me, i got fed up knowing he thought she was a manager.

me: *sigh* sir you have the wrong person ie get nb.

she nods probably glad to get away and grabs nb.

nb: hello sir what seems to be the problem.

rm: i'll tell you whats wrong you employ here let a f***ing alcoholic cut all of us buy liquor i don't know who you hire here but they need to do there f###ing job, my time is important you don't understand i sell cars (i don't know why that's important) and i need to get to work, and you cashier is doing nothing.

i had just finished checking his stuff when nb turns and ask why i didn't do anything and when the man was paying i whispered to her what had happened, how i thought he let him cut, what the man had said to me and how i didn't feel safe, my boss nodded and apologized to him and saying in a loud voice (not to embarrass me but just to let the costumer think he won) that i need to be more vigilant next time before apologizing to him and the woman behind him, i check him out he is still angry how i wasted his time and left. though the lady was more understanding knowing i can't always keep track of everyone, and that's how my day started i got sick latter and had to clock out early to head home.",wolfhunterpack,tfr
41,do i look like a thief?!,"first time posting, but i have so many stories from all my various jobs, i figured i might as well start posting them.  i have a lot more stories for r/talesfromfastfood but i decided to start at the beginning, with my first ever job.

some backstory, this was my first job when i was 18 (almost 19), and i worked in a fitting room in a discount clothing store. let me give you a little overview of how it worked. so, in the fitting room, there was this thing called the ""t"", it was a metal t-shaped rail-thing.  and basically, you would hang the clothes up on it so i could count and check each article for it's tags. then i would a give a number that corresponded to the amount of clothes (the limit was seven clothes) and send them on their way to the fitting room to try 'em on. when they came back, i would do the process again. this was mean to 1) make sure no one was sneaking in extra clothes and 2) prevent (or at least limit) theft.

a lot of people did not like this system. i think mostly, it was because people were in a hurry or they just didn't understand why the process was necessary. many, many people tried to rush past me once they had tried on their clothes and i would have to call them back so i could count and check. most of the time, like 9 times out of 10, they'd be annoyed that i called them back but they would relent, put the clothes on the rack, calm down and then go about their day when i was finished. allow me to introduce to the tenth time.

so, it was this instance, this lady tried to rush past me and i called her back. she stopped gave me a look of utter disdain but came back. let's call her bl (bitchy lady) and me is obviously me. so she hangs up the clothes and i thanked her and did my thing, counting and checking tags.

me: ""okay, you're good, thanks for shopping at {insert clothing store}!""

the lady kinda huffs and grabs her clothes. i was a little miffed, but eh, what could you do? some people were in a rush. but then, she puts the clothes in the basket and comes back and stands in front of me with her arms open.

bl: ""look at me.""me: ""uhh..."" i looked at her then arched a brow at her, trying to figure out what the literal f\*ck was happening.

bl: ""do i *look* like a *thief?!*""

i blinked a few times and sorta stuttered out a ""uhh, no?""  seeing how i had checked her clothes and they were fine; and then she goes off.  she stands straight, puts one hand on her hip and points the other at me.

bl: ""*exactly!* so maybe next time before you put me through that you could use your *head!""* she yelled something else at me before charging off but i don't remember what it was.

i remember just standing there kinda like...did i just get called an idiot for doing my job? it was so f\*cking weird and now i can laugh it off.

anyways, that's it. most of my bargain store stories are pretty mild in comparison to the shit i went through at my second job (that is where most of my stories will come from) and i eventually left because my boss was a jackass who kept scheduling me clopening shifts and i got tired of it. thanks for reading!",FidgetAwesomeSauce,tfr
42,fight in the check out lane,"okay so i work at a grocery store and i was checking people out. this father comes into my lane and he has his son (who is taller than him, like pretty tall.) who i believe has special needs. (the way he was acting and that i help out with students with special needs) he looked familiar and i thought he was one of the students i helped with in highschool. 

""hey are you \*insert name and high school here\*?"" 

""oh no he goes to a different school."" the dad answered. and right after that the kid punches his dad. he starts punching and biting him. he grabs his neck and slams him onto the conveyor belt and starts and clawing at his dad. the dad tries to make him stop and people start backing away. and i just stand there thinking *they didn't cover this in the training.*

i am still new here btw. a co-worker asked if she should call the cops but he said no, (he eventually said yes) it is awfully quite in the store since everyone stopped what they were doing to watch this. the police were called and two men were able to get the son off of his dad. the assistant manager asks me and the bagger if we are okay. we said yes and he sends us on our brake early.  

i don't know what happened but i do see the son and the father at the store occasionally. 

now i understand caring with someone with special needs is difficult and that sometime they will punch you. but this was actually scary since i never experience something like this before. i have helped out with special ed students in high school and i plan on becoming a special education teacher, so i understand violent outbreaks tend to happen but again, i never experienced stuff like this. i've scene fights attempted but never scene one happen.

44,customer assumed age meant seniority,"our coupon exception policy updated at the beginning of the year. we’ve had plenty of customers argue and insist on speaking to managers because of this.

i was on registers preparing to monitor a new employee. it’s her last day of training, so i just mainly stand there and make sure she’s all good. there’s a bit of a line so i begin to ring while waiting on her. i get a customer who wants a manager because i told her the coupon wouldn’t work. she’s getting louder and louder as i tried to explain the updated policy, but honestly it seemed like she just wanted to yell until she got her way. i asked her to step to register 1, because that’s the only register managers use, while i called the manager up. our main manager is on a conference call and we’re super busy that day so i tell her it’ll be a wait. i have a new customer step up and he’s just giving me the sympathy look. while i’m checking him out our newest employee comes up to registers. the angry lady beelines over to her and starts complaining. 

here’s an important detail- i’m in college but have been there over two years but our new employee is semi retired. this meant the customer thought she was in charge. 

i’m finishing with my customer and preparing to go over and explain what’s going on to both of them when the customer’s girlfriend (possibly, seemed like it at least) came over and told me that the customer was saying i was only refusing because i was lazy and didn’t want to, and that i shouldn’t work there then.
i handed the man his receipt, looked at the girlfriend, shrugged and said, “she’s newer than me.” the guy burst out laughing and that boosts my mood. 
i finish getting the line down and look over, the lady is being checked out. i head over after their done, since if she wants me fired i’m not going to deal with her, and it’s a good learning opportunity. i ask how it went and she tells me that’s she’s not sure why the customer wanted her, but she said the heard the story and said the same thing i did, and complimented me and the customer was fine with not getting the discount from her.

i just stood there for almost ten minutes monitoring her and giving my coworkers my long-suffering work.

45,old gm knows some gangs,"ok, so this happened a few weeks ago and while i wasn't actually there at the time my friend who is also a manager at my store was and he told me all about it when i came in the next day. 

late on a monday night where we close at a modest 8:30 which is a bit earlier than most of the other stores in our area, there were only two people working in the store. my friend who is mid 20's and my new gm who is 65+ years old and just recently started at our store after our old gm quit. now i don't really like him but honestly, this moment earned a lot of points from me. he had called in sick earlier that morning when i was in but ended up coming in later after i had left and did the closing instead of opening. 

so about 5 minutes until we close a shady looking guy walks in and immediately my friend goes to help him out, ask if he needs help finding anything because he has to close the store and the faster he finds his stuff the faster everyone can go home. the guy insists that he doesn't need help and wanders around the store just grabbing random stuff and putting it into a basket. at this point, he is the only customer in the store and my friends knows that this guy is going to try and steal something so he calls our gm over the radio to watch him go through the aisles. 

suddenly the phone rings and as my friend is closer to the back of the store he goes to pick up the phone there instead of running all the way to the front. after about 5 seconds of greeting the person on the phone, he hears some noises from one of the aisles and someone yell ""hey!""

immediately, he apologizes to the person on the phone and puts them on hold, runs to the front of the store and see's our very sick 65+ year old gm running outside trying to catch this guy who just stole from us. 

my friend told me after this that he would've just let the guy go and i agree honestly. so he's just standing by the door when our gm comes from around the corner outside with a bike. strange. he explains that he couldn't catch the guy but apparently, he slipped on the ice, while trying to get onto his bike and then ran away with our basket of stuff. so our gm took the guys bike in return. his logic was that if he wants his bike back he'll return the stuff he stole.

after about 5 minutes and my friend finishes counting tills and whatnot, he comes back to the front and see's our gm going through the tree's and bushes (it's pitch black outside) looking for this guy with the flashlight from his phone. 

by some stroke of luck, he finds the basket of stuff and brings it back inside. not everyone can go home, right? wrong. there are like 5 cars parked outside with their lights on, and for some context, only people who shop at our store use our lot. also, my friend doesn't drive so our gm is the only one who should have a car outside right now. my friend is losing his mind thinking they are going to get stabbed or something for messing with the shoplifter. he voices this and our gm just goes 

&gt; ""oh don't worry, i know a lot of gangs in this area"". 

at this point, my friend doesn't even know what to say and after about 10 minutes of waiting at the front door, all the cars parked outside are gone. they park the bike just outside of the doors to our store just in case the dude comes back. 

when we came in the next morning, the bike was gone so i'm guessing he came back to pick it up at some point. this was honestly the craziest thing i have ever heard and i doubt something like this will ever happen again. ",smallishcrab,tfr
46,"she didn't remmeber me, but i sure remembered her.","this happened a while ago but i'm writing about it now because i saw the lady that this story revolves around and once again thanked my lucky stars i got promoted to another position.

back when i was a cashier, i worked really hard to remember all the codes for the produce and other items, especially our store brand water bottle packages (35 count). our brand, plus another name brand, had short 5 digit codes we could input instead of having to scan the entire package. unfortunately, every other brang we sold didnt have a code, so we had to scan them.

in comes cranky lady (cl) and soon to be embarrassed daughter (ed). the lady kinda throws her stuff on the conveyor belt and then zooms by with 2 packages of water bottles that i needed to scan, so i tell her ""ma'am may i scan your water first?"" she's quick to make a fuss about it and starts complaining about how she's ""not stealing, whats the big deal."" i ignore her, which pisses her off. she keeps up bitching and complaining, and i do my best to keep quiet. eventually her daughter tells her ""mom stop it you're being annoying."" cl says ""oh am i? sorry, i get cranky when i dont eat."" i quickly finish the transaction and move on.

one week later, i'm on the register again and its slow, so my mind drifts and i remember cl and ed and laugh to myself about the issue wh3n guesd who comes up to my register? if you said cl and ed, you get a gold star.

i kinda stare at her because i can't believe that she's right there when i was just thinking about her. and sure enough, she has 2 packages of water again, this time they're our store brand. i start scanning her items and again she zooms by with the water at the bottom of the cart. 

me: oh, was that 2 or 3 packages of water?

cl: 2, do you need to scan them?

me: no its alright i have a code here

cl: oh good youre smart, last week i had a dumbass scan them. she thought i was going to run with them. pretty stupid of her.

i'm in shock. i can't believe her. i kinda stare at her and her daughter goes ""mom....dont start"" but her mom goes ""what? she was stupid.""

i smile. ""was it the same brand?"" i ask her. ""yep. i always get this brand."" she says.

i smile even more, ""really? because i remember it being [other name brand] and that one doesn't have a code like [the sore brand] does.""

she looks at me and i can *see* her recognize me at last. she stays quite, and i see her daughter die a little inside. i finish quickly, and wish her a nice day, to which she responds ""yeah whatever"".

it honestly brings a smile to my face remembering this.",Daddy-kinkshame-me,tfr
47,guy tries to get me in trouble for damaging my own car,"i work as a part-time courtesy clerk for my local grocery store for a year and a half now. my job includes taking out the trash and compost, heavy lifting for customers, on-site-spill-clean-up, and (key to this story), collecting the shopping carts from the outside corals around the parking lot, and bringing them into the store. 

at my particular store, there's no designation between customer and employee parking. we have a fairly large parking lot, as we're attached to a mall, so management doesn't really care where we park. the parking lot in question is also on a slight incline up from the store. not enough to be noticable, but just enough for the carts to role away on me if i don't pay attention. this has happened to me on multiple occasions, and thankfully, i've been able to catch the carts before they collided with a car or rolled into traffic.

about two weeks ago, a few carts finally got away from me and rolled into a car.

i was trying to put together a large train of carts after rush hour, and didn't notice the first few in the front detach and role away until it was too late. i heard a crash and my heart sank as i realized what had made it. i ran over to survey the damage to the car, but quickly realized that the car i had hit was my own. the feeling of relief washed over me, and i collected the runaway carts to bring back, when a man shouted at me, catching my attention.

am = angry man

**am**: hey, you! where do you think you're going?!

**me**: uh, i'm sorry sir, do you mean me?

**am**: yeah, i mean you!! you just gonna walk away after you damaged that car with those carts?!

**me**: oh, there's a misunderstanding sir, that car-

**am**: don't try to weasle your way outta this! i saw you walk away shamelessly, but you didn't count on someone calling you out on it!

**me**: sir, if you'd let me explain-

**am**: oh no, you had your chance! (by now, his phoenix wright-style accusations had attracted 7 or 8 passerbys, and he looks to a random bystander) hey buddy, can you go get the manager for me? this guy is trying to get away with vandalism. 

the guy nods and runs into the store, and while we wait, am proceeds to go on a rant about being a decent human being and how you should always tell the truth, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah. all the while, i'm trying to show him that my car was the one i hit, but he wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise. the bystander eventually comes back with the frontend manager (fm).

**fm**: what's going on?

**am**: your employee just ran carts into a car, and tried to get away with it!

**fm**: oh my, is this true [my name]?

**me**: yeah, they got away from me, but they hit my car.

**am**: ha! yeah right! prove that it's your car, then!

with a smug, shit-eating grin, i dig into my pockets, pull out my keys, and hit the alarm button on my key fob. sure enough, my car alarm goes off, and am is standing there, the wind out of his sails and looking completely gobsmacked. i hear a few chuckles come from the eyeing group of bystanders (not from everyone, this isn't r/thathappened), and people finally disperse after shaking their heads in disbelief. am eventually leaves, a look of pure defeat on his face.

48,way to tweet yourself out of a job!,"so i worked on a college campus (you would ~~expect~~ hope people to be more educated, but nope), and we were hiring for our print department.  we went through the numerous applications, did our interviews, and were ready to offer someone the job.  now, they still have to go through hr, so when we call them to let them know, we make sure to let them know that their employment is not set until they have completed their hr paperwork.

this genius decided to tweet within the hour something along the lines of ""got a job at the campus print center, free prints for all my n****s!""  upon being made aware of this tweet by someone who knew her, i immediately called up hr and asked about rescinding the job offer, and since she had not had her appointment yet, it was no problem.

i called her a little bit after that, and it went to voicemail.  i did the standard ""upon further consideration, we've decided to go in another direction..."", and left it at that.

she never did call back or ask for any further explanation, but it was funny as hell to see a little bit later on her twitter ""can a job take back their employment offer?!?""  oh, i can't tell you how much restraint it took me to not comment, but it was fun to see some of her followers basically telling her she was sol.

49,the restroom is out of order.,"yesterday our store’s toilet started leaking from around the base. there was a nasty yellow/green liquid coming up through the floor. we put a sign on the door stating it was out of order. we also blocked it off with some boxes and a cart. there were also wet floor signs inside the restroom.

however, some bright person decided they needed to go right now. despite us having plenty of surrounding stores with working restrooms. 

a woman runs into the restroom, shoving the cart and pushing the boxes. she of course flushes when she’s finished and the liquid begins to leak, covering the entire bathroom floor and sleeping into the stock room. great. 

she then has the nerve to complain that our bathroom has a terrible smell and that she’s stepped in water.

50,those damn chinese inches...,"morning fellow retaileers...

this is a tale from about 6 months ago that just flashed back into my memory, and it's too stupid not to share with you.

as mentioned previously, i work for a photo lab/camera store, dealing with printing, framing, photo albums, cameras, drones, accessories - you name it.

we do quite a lot of business online in our home country. one of the more common online items we sell, are photo albums for some reason.

the lady in question, lives on the other side of the country, and ordered a specific album to house 5x7"" photos, at a capacity of 160 photos.

photo sizes are still measured in inches, pretty much everywhere. obviously, it is a trivial conversion to mm, but the size is standardised. it does trip people up some time, as we live in a metric country. but one inch, is 25.4mm, no matter which way you cut it.

we dutifully picked the album, checked it and shipped it.

a week later, we got an irate email. now, thanks to the magic of archiving, i have these emails for you verbatim (more or less - names changed to protect both the innocent and the terminally stupid).

&gt; i have received the album and i am furious as the pocket size is not the size advertised. obviously, someone
can't use a ruler. according to the album, the photo size is 5x7 inches?. i have measured them and they are
actually 3.8 x 5.4 inches so the pockets are too small for my photos. that is $ 34.85 wasted.

hmmm... that's weird we thought. obviously a manufacturing fault, as there is not way that size is produced normally, and we just picked the wrong product. why would we use a ruler anyway? you can tell at a glance after a while if it is 6x4"" or 5x7"" (the two sizes photo albums come in) never seen an error like that before, but, let's keep the customer happy and not immediately assume shes a raving lunatic...

so, we sent an email back, apologising (after we couldn't get her on the phone), explaining we were shipping a replacement to her, and if she could send the original back, we would re-imburse her the shipping cost so we can take it up with the album manufacturer. we also asked her to send a photo of the pockets with a ruler in the shot so we can start the process with the  supplier.

in the meantime, i checked the rest of the stock, assuming it was a batch problem, and they were fine.

so, we got back...

&gt;i will send this album back to you tomorrow with australia post. yes, the sticker on the back of the album says
5x7. that was the size i ordered. it is, however, not the actual size of the pockets. i will have to leave it to you to
measure yourself when it is returned. the album itself is a lovely album but my photos will not fit 5.4x3.8 inches.
i look forward to the correct album. i will include a copy of the postal receipt.

a little snotty, but whatever. she's calmed down, problem solved, we'll send the other one back for a credit and we can move on with our lives.

the new one was over-nighted, so the next day, we got another email

&gt;i have received the replacement album today. it is exactly the same as the previous album and also has smaller
pockets than it states. it should be 5x7 inches as ordered. the pockets also as in the first album measure
3.8x5.4 inches. you stated in your letter that you had measured them. what did you use to measure them? i
used a tape measure with inch measures. i now have 2 albums which are too small for my photos. what do you
suggest i do now? am i to return both albums and then you can refund the postage and if you are unable to fill
my order also refund to my credit card the money i have paid for the original album.

ok, what the actual is going on here? both my colleague who was dealing with her, and i had checked this album. i knew, categorically, that the album was correct. what on earth was she measuring?

so, we sent back another email, this time with some images attached

&gt;i have attached two images of how i measured the previous album before it was sent.
we don’t have a ruler with inches however converting it to mm gives us the dimensions shown here;
7 inches = 17.78cm
5 inches = 12.7cm
are you able to show us how you have measured the albums?

then, the kicker response came in...

&gt;dear *salesperson* when i use a tape measure showing inches on one side and centimetres on the reverse my
calculations of 17.78 cm = 5.4 inches and 12.7=3.8 inches. it makes for more accurate measuring if you do not
try to convert. most school rulers have inches down one side and centimetres down the other. i am still waiting.
shall i return both these albums.? it is impossible to view the photos you sent.

ok - so what is happening here, is that she's stuffing up the measurement, and is oblivious, despite being of an age that should be somewhat familiar with inches and feet.

and then, had the audacity to tell us we were idiots for ""converting"" the size, when she was doing the conversion completely wrong herself.

so, we sent another series of pictures, this time with a ruler with inch markings on it.

&gt;i have found a tape measure in store that has inches and cm, and re-measured the remaining album we
have in store that matches the two sent to you.
hopefully you can see these images within the email *(we embedded them this time, so there was no excuse)*. the measurement of the sleeves is definitely 5 x 7
inches.

&gt;i am unsure how you have calculated the figures below as 1 inch is 2.54 cm
1 in 2.54 cm
2 in 5.08 cm
3 in 7.62 cm
4 in 10.16 cm
5 in 12.70 cm
6 in 15.24 cm
7 in 17.78 cm
if you no longer want the albums you can return them both and we can refund the cost of the albums.

there was another back and forth exchange, denying our knowledge of maths and the basic dimensions of the universe, until i jumped in and suggested

&gt;""why don't you try and see if one of your 5x7"" photos fits?""

there was silence for a day or two.

then, an email came in, mildly apologetic.

&gt; hello *salesperson*

&gt;i got another ruler, and this seems to show the size correctly, and my photos went in. i will keep both the albums thank-you. it was this cheap, probably chinese ruler that i was using.

so, problem solved, and case closed.

at no point, did she appear to even try placing a photo in the album, or even visually laying a photo on top. her first thing, upon receiving the album which was ordered and labelled as a 5x7"" album, was not to try putting a photo in, but whipping out a ruler and incorrectly measuring the slots to make sure... which is weird.

what do i think was happening? often times when you use a plastic school style ruler with cm's on one side, and inches on the other, they start from opposite ends - usually from the left. so cm's on one side, starting from 0 on the left, then rotate it though 180 degrees, and then the inches start on the left.

they don't line up. so what i think was happening, was she had the ruler on the cm side, measured across, the looked at the inches on the bottom (which is upside down and reversed), and somehow extrapolated the dimensions from that.

but, no, it was probably the tools she was using right?",ThePhotoGuyUpstairs,tfr
51,remembering a customer who committed suicide,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromretail/comments/b5ygrd/rip\_to\_my\_favorite\_regular/](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromretail/comments/b5ygrd/rip_to_my_favorite_regular/) made me remember an experience i had.

i used to work in a small chain of bookstores/stationery shops. one day a woman, 20-ish or something asks for books handling depression and suicide. since she was the only customer and the topic was rather sensible i got to talk a little with her, she was studying psychology (or psychiatry, i don't remember anymore) and asked for those books to study. during our conversation she told me that she is studying psychology to help people.

she became a regular and always took time to small-talk, discuss different things and books. one day she told me that she started to volunteer at a suicide prevention line (you could call when you feel bad and they would try to help you). she didn't got paid, the whole helpline was voluntary and lost money every day.

&amp;#x200b;

now she devoured the books and i could count on her coming in at monday, sometimes i even switched shifts with my boss just to be there. don't get me wrong, i didn't had a romantic interest in her, it was just awesome to know someone you liked and who actually did read books.

&amp;#x200b;

one day she didn't showed up and i didn't thought anything of it, maybe holidays, maybe she finished her studies and so on. i have to admit after a few weeks i stopped thinking of her.

&amp;#x200b;

time passes and one day a couple shows up, asks me if i could tell them when (my name) works. i tell them that its me, they inform me that their daughter isn't anymore between us and they thanked me, apparently the bookstore was a place outside of the rest of the world for her, where she could stop all her thoughts and just be, apparently she also told them how relaxing it was discussing with someone who doesn't judges and has no other interests than books.

the study, the many shifts she took at the suicide-prevention line (she took way to many, but she wanted to help people) was just to much for her.

&amp;#x200b;

after they left i remember how i locked the door to prevent other customers enter the store and i just sat down for like a half hour. i don't remember about what i was thinking or if i just had an empty stare. people dying is pretty normal, when my grand-grandfather died i wasn't sad. he was over 100 years old. he had to fight in both world wars. he has seen the worlds cruelty. he was happily married for more than 80 years. he has seen the worlds beauty. he was allowed to leave. but this 20 something old person who just wanted to help others? more than 10 years passed since then and it still gives me a weird taste in my mouth.

one day last october i was sitting behind the sales counter chilling, because i had finished all of the repairs that were due. sort of a one eye on the store, one eye on my computer. in walks a 50 something woman who was looking a little bit upset (not in an angry way). my first assumption was that she had broken something on her bike and was stressed because she needed it fixed, but then she pulls out a bag of bike specific clothes, shoes and a helmet. she goes on to explain that her husband was a cyclist, and had died unexpectedly. she wanted to donate his gear to the local high school team so that someone would benefit. at this point she is sniffling and crying, so i do my best to comfort her. eventually she leaves the shop and i give the clothes to the person who coordinates with the high school team. normally i try to leave what i heard at work there, but this one incident just hurts to think about.

53,the shortest employment in history,"short wtf story from the old gas station.

the old gas station had a real problem with keeping the staff. many quit within the first month. some lasted a lot less than that.

the drawback is advertising and interviewing people constantly. this one guy takes the cake. we usually had at least 30-40 candidates per vacancy and the manager wasn't great picking candidates.

we pick this guy and called in for an interview. me and the manager call him in and begin the interview. he passed and we hired him on the spot. we start by taking him to the guy stocking shelves and tell him to show him how to stock and face up produce.

he says 'wait i have to fill shelves? i quit' and walks out the door with one of our uniforms.

he quit in less than 2 minutes on the job.

&amp;#x200b;

edit: this guy had beaten the record. the previous record (second place) was a teenage lad who quit in 30 minutes. to be fair, he had learning difficulties and was worried about fucking things up in the fast pace. we understood perfectly that he was uncomfortable and nervous. we parted on good terms. shame, nice guy.

third place went to a woman who was put onto the register straight from the interview (normal practice). everything was going well until the computer system crashed (happened regularly) and she thought she had broken it, started panicking and starting hyperventilating. she left after only 3 hours.

54,the new lady...has left?,"short story from the old gas station

i worked night for a long time at the old gas station. there was only two of us who regularly did nights and the other other guy was retiring.

i don't really know what the manager was doing but he left it to the last week to start advertising for a replacement. we got plenty of resumes and whittled them doing to one. a middle aged lady whose name i don't even remember.

she was put through the training course for about a week with a few supervised shifts serving customers. that all went fine.

then we start the nights, she has the first two nights with me showing her the ropes and what time to do them. the two nights go fine. on the third night, i could get her started on the shift and go home after a few hours. the fourth night she would on her own from the start.

i stayed for the first two hours and give her my cell phone number to call if she needs any help. with that i got on my bike to leave. its 1am. i light a cigarette and set my cd player going (thats how long ago this was) and starting pedaling home.

i got 50 yards down the street before i get a call. shes freaking out and needs me back immediately. as soon i walk in, she walks out the door in tears saying 'i can't do this. i can't do this' and never came back.

the first song hadn't even finished, i hadn't finished my cigarette, she hadn't even served a customer. she was on her own for less than 3 minutes and she quits 1:03 am.

i even check the cameras, she just started crying the second i was out the door.

what in the actual fuck? i'm still scratching my head 14 years later.

&amp;#x200b;

edit: mir2008 mention in a comment about her feeling unsafe. very understandable but i forgot to mention that at the time, the nightshift had a locked door policy. she had to lock herself in and serve at the night window. she needed to open at 6am for the morning rush. i have an idea why she left and that will be the next post.

55,"""always listen to the customer!""","so at the store i work at (it's like a pharmacy/beauty store) we do an advantage card (reward card). it's the standard gain points, save them up and then use them to purchase stuff card. 


it's just gone lunch on a sunday so there's a bit of a rush and since we're understaffed with most of the tills not working, there is a line of about 10 or so people with more people coming to que as quickly as we can serve them. to be honest, most people only had one or two items if they weren't buying a meal deal so things were moving quite steadily. 


it's important to note that at this time there were only 4 people in that day (not including the pharmacy team) so we were two people down, with one on their lunch break, leaving three of us on the shop floor. my manager and myself both on the tills and my other colleague let's call him a, was keeping an eye on the fragrance area. because of the value of the items that are kept there the area isn't supposed to be left unsupervised unless it's deemed absolutely necessary, for instance, a line of 20 odd people that doesn't seem to be going anywhere and the customers are getting annoyed. 


i finally get to this particular customer who looks like a lovely granny, she had two lovely kids both with down syndrome (slightly important for what happens next) with her who i assumed to be her grandkids. as usual, i start off by saying hi, apologising for the wait and asking them if they'd had a good day so far. the old lady just ignores me (that's fine, many customers do that, no biggie) she proceeds to ask if she can get that (her item) on her points, to which i say yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. as long as she had the exact amount of points or more than she could definitely purchase the item with them. 


as i'm about to double check that she wants to use her points (because she did have enough) the younger girl with her pats her shoulder in a comforting way, the old lady just swipes her hand away and snaps don't touch my shoulder! i was taken back by her tone but didn't show it since she then explained to the girl that she needed to take more painkillers. this happened within a two minutes max. 


noticing that she's actually buying some paracetamol and that she's in pain i hurry with the transaction and then hand her the receipt, letting her know how much was left on her points card. that's when she freezes and her face turns from annoyed to bewildered and insulted. she asks if i used her points and i said yes since she had asked if she could use them. she then goes to say, getting quite huffy, that she didn't ask to use her points and that she didn't say anything at all, that i had just jumped to it. 


immediately, i'm pissed off, she's ranting about how i jumped to it and how she didn't want to use her points. since the line was still pretty long and my manager had ducked into the back room to collect an online order for her own customer, i had to call a over to help me out. i apologise profusely for the misunderstanding and explain to her that i'm getting someone over to fix it. i'm currently not trained or authorised to do refunds/exchanges so i have to call a over, it's a small store so it didn't even take him a minute. i explained the situation and then moved to the till next to my original one to continue serving customers. while doing so, i hear her complaining about me, how i jumped to it and that she didn't say anything etc and that i should always listen to the customer. 


i knew to pick my battles, i wasn't about to argue with a customer that i had listened to her and that it wasn't my fault you changed your mind about how you wanted to pay but didn't tell me. yes, i really had to concentrate on the next few customers to avoid my voice cracking and myself crying (i'm weak, the second someone raises their voice i'm niagra falls) but i certainly wasn't going to cause a scene whether i was in the right or not. 


i did check with my other colleague after she came down from lunch about what she would've done if a customer had said ""can i get that on my points"" to her and we both would take it as they want to pay with their points. obviously i realise that either a) this lady changed her mind and just didn't tell me or b) she was just trying to ask if she could collect points on that purchase, more likely the latter. 


i'm honestly surprised that this is only my third crappy(ish) customer in the few months i've been working for this company.

56,back in a moment,"tl:dr at the bottom.


a few years ago a small part of my role was training new employees at various branches in our receiving and dispatch methods, usually only as required. most of the time the store manager wouldn't need my input, it wasn't a hard job.

i was called to a branch as the manager was having issues with an employee that had been there nearly a month and was making obvious and silly paperwork mistakes. the employee, we'll call him brian, was 19 years old but quite mature and intelligent.

i watch brian work for a while, showed him a few tips as he went but it was obvious he had everything under control. come lunchtime i sat brian down and  told him:
""you appear to be getting a hang of the role and the computer systems are easy enough for you. i can only suggest that you perhaps be a bit more attentive to what you are doing at the time as it seems you have been making a few recurring mistakes. keep up the good work.""
brian thanked me and said he had to get his water bottle from the staff lounge. later, on the security cameras, you see brian walk passed the staff lounge to the lockers. he gets his cap and car keys, goes out the side exit, gets in his car and leaves to never return.

hr later said he claimed i berated and ridiculed him. as it was my word against his and all our camera footage clearly showed that i was calm and collected the whole morning nothing came of it.

57,and her stupid ponytail...,"nl: nice lady. the customer i was helping
al: angry lady. she was so angry...

i work in a card store and a few minutes after i clocked in, a customer (nl) asked me if we had any stuffed animals that were animated. she was looking for one for a birthday. we almost always have some variety of dancing or singing stuffed animal but they're always seasonal. so i thought showed her our spring bunny that sings ""you are my sunshine."" 

so we're walking up towards the front of the store and i see al. al is a regular customer so i see her a lot. but, al is just scary looking. she is short, with a jet black ""this isn't good enough for me"" bob. i would say she has rbf but it's more like ""resting satan face."" this lady just looks like she will steal your voice and grant you with legs or something. she usually comes in on a weekday between 11-2. it's not her normal time to come in but i digress.

the front section of our store has lots of glass shelves where we display seasonal gifts and trinkets. there is also our vera bradley display. al is stood right in the center of the walkway. just standing there. so i say ""excuse me"" and she doesn't move so i just squeeze past. i mostly run into the vera stand and might have brushed against her a bit. apparently that was illegal!

i pick up the singing bunny and hand it to nl so she can listen to it and see if she likes it.

suddenly, al is storming around the front of the store, grumbling to herself. unfortunately, i don't catch everything she says because i was trying to focus on helping nl. al picks up a dancing chicken and slams it down on the front table. (all of her dialogue is in bits and pieces because, again, i was trying to focus on nl) 

al: she can't see a stupid bunny! 
she storms out of the store and into the mall. okay, it's over. right? ofc it's not.
al: (stomping back towards the store) blah blah blah something about a butterfly (this part confused me too)

now i assume she's talking to someone else (she isn't) because she says this:

al: and her stupid ponytail

my heart stopped for a second. i wear my hair in a high ponytail to work quite often because it's easy and it's neat and out of my face. in my head, i'm panicking. hopefully i'm outwardly showing peace and tranquility to nl. 

nl: (smiling. it's a cute toy, what can i say?) i'll take it.

me: awesome! 

i take the toy and we walk to the register. i ring out someone who was waiting at the register and as i'm saying ""have a good one!"" i look to the entrance to see al walk far enough to peer in and glare at me from outside. chills.

nothing more happened, but seriously. she was so angry that i squeezed past her. and this all happened within like 2 minutes. it was frightening to say the least. 

i got nl hooked up with a sick deal on that singing bunny though.",UndeniablyKawai,tfr

59,rip to my favorite regular :(,"i work at a gas station in a small town outside of a city. my customers are mainly working class people, coming to and from work. i found out tonight that one of my favorite regulars, patrick, passed away a week and a half ago. i didn’t really know him, but i wanted to share this story about him- 

a couple weeks ago we had a pretty bad snow storm. it was bad enough that i decided to leave my car here and have my roommate pick me up in his truck. the next day, naturally my car was completely buried under snow. about an hour before i got off, patrick noticed this and brushed all the snow off of my car and shoveled a bit behind it. without prompting, just to be nice. it was really sweet.

60,so one day i accidentally melted my work area!,"as a teenager i used to work for a company which sold car parts and accessories. we also sold 'touch up' paint for cars, but could also mix paint on site to order. unlike today where you can type in a code into a machine, and it will automatically mix the correct volumes of paint to create the desired colour, back in the late 2000s we were still doing it by hand. which brings me to what was probably the most embarrassing incident of my working life!

the area in which we mixed the paint was quite small, it consisted of a large desk, upon which sat a computer, an aerosol compressor, and a set of industrial scales. above this desk were several shelves of paints, which we would mix together for the customer.

as we had to do everything by hand, and also had to do some calculations as we went along, i was one of the only members of staff trusted to make the paint. it was something i was quite proud of, as to be honest most other things we did (installation of car parts etc) i was completely incompetent with.

one thing which frustrated me with the mixing area was that it was very messy. the desk, computer and shelves were all originally white, whereas now, they were white with swaths of different coloured paints which had been spilled all over the place. as this area was on public display, i felt that it made that part of the store look quite messy.

so one quiet saturday afternoon, i took it upon myself to clean the entire area and return it to looking good as new! we used to keep a bottle of solvent (i think it may have been acetone) handy for cleaning our equipment, so with that in hand, and a set of cleaning cloths, i went about my business.

after not very long, the entire area was looking much better, i had returned the shelves, computer keyboard, and desk back to their original white complexion. i was very please with myself and it was a job well done.

or so i thought.

a few hours later whilst doing some stock checking out the back, i caught glimpse of myself in the mirror and my heart sank. the bottom third of the front of my work uniform had started to melt away. i start to panic and rush out to the mixing area.

what greeted me, was not the clean slick white surfaces i had left behind earlier. but rather the desk had, for lack of a better word, inflated! there was a plastic coating which protected the wooden desk, under which a large 'blister' of air had gathered, around 2 inches deep. the plastic coating on the edge of the shelves had began to form little icicles where it had began melting. the letters on the computer keyboard had melted off, and the keys were starting to flatten.

not knowing what to do, i burst the 'desk blister' (which seemed to do the trick) and scraped the 'shelf icicles' off. i left a cleaning cloth on top top the keyboard to hide the damage. i quickly cleaned the areas off with water and hoped for the best. 

i thought that i had got away with it until closing time when i bumped into the manager (who i had been avoiding after this accident), where he complimented me on modifying my work uniform into a crop top. needless to say that i was rumbled. fortunately, no permanent damage appeared to be done to the mixing area. unfortunately i had to buy a brand new uniform!

although it was a bit melted, the mixing area had never looked so clean, although needless to say the solvent was hidden away for the remainder of the time i spent with the company!

tldr: i managed to melt my work area and dissolve my work uniform during a shift.",low_myope,tfr
61,a disgusting encounter,"hi! ltl, ftp, mobile, english is not my first language, etc. this happened a few years ago and not in english so i'm paraphrasing.

i'm no longer in retail, but i really enjoy the stories here and thought i could contribute with one of the stories i tell to demonstrate how disgusting people are. 

background: i worked in a small family owned store. at the time of this encounter i was out in the store alone while my boss was in his office doing paperwork or taking a nap (dude worked so much so he deserved it). as all other stores do, we ran sales. i don't remember exactly what sale, but picture ""30-70 % on selected shoes"".

so, this fateful night an old grumpy man (ogm) enter and inquires about the sale. i show him the shelved with merchandise that are currently on sale and let him browse. 

ogm calls me to come over and the following happens:

ogm: ""do you have theese shoes *point down at the shoes he came in*

blue reeboks, white stain on the front, sole almost worn to the ground. 

me: ""yep! but they're not on sale.""

ogm: ""show me""

*we move 3 meters so we're by the reeboks, followed by questions about his size*

me: *hands him the shoes* ""here you go! would you like to try them on to be on the safe side?""

ogm: ""yeah"" 

and he proceeds to take his old shoes of in front of me just as i realise.. that wasn't a white stain on the front of his shoe. that was his long, disgusting toenail sticking up from a hole it had crawled for itself. 

me: *dumbstruck, trying not to puke* ""we have socks for trying on..(interrupted)""

ogm: ""nah i don't wear socks in shoes"" and puts on the new ones before i can do anything 

seeing as my options are to sell this man these shoes or burn them i am turning on all the charm i can muster while giving him the typical retail compliments. 

ogm: ""so, how much do these cost with the sale percentage taken from it?""

my stomach drops as i tell him they're not a part of the sale. 

ogm: ""this is ridiculous, the sign says the store is 70 % off! you need to give me 70 % off!"" 

this turns into a bit of an argument where i recount our previous conversation, and tell him the price is firm and him being a grumpy old a-hole for the next ten minutes. i have no idea why, but he accepts and buys the shoes. i gave a cheery ""have a nice night"" and recieve a hrmph in return. i was just happy i didn't have to destroy the shoes.

so i work at a place where we take id pictures for government use such as passport, drivers licence, etc. this one lady comes in and wants drivers licence pictures, lets call her karen because well the shoe fits. now the requirements for drivers photos pictures are quite strict such as the head must be a specific size, taken at a direct angle with no shadows. if these requirements arent met the picture could get rejected but we do hundreds of pictures a week we never get pictures rejected.
anyway, so my coworker takes karens picture and shes not happy with it, he takes 5 more pictures and shes not happy. then she says ""no you cant get my neck in the photo"" this is obviously stupid because its a photo of your head and shoulders its impossible for your neck not to be in the picture and still meet the requirements. my coworker explains that its not possible and we have to take pictures a certain way plus these pictures dont even go on the actual licence just an application form. and anyway, its not our job to make people look like models. she begins to speak to him like total crap ""i dont care. all im asking is for you to take a picture at a different angle because i dont want my neck to show, if you cant do that then you dont know what youre doing its not difficult."" i was busy with another customer but i heard all of this and was starting to get pissed off. i also heard her say 'dont you have a different lighting?' like lol no. luckily my coworker has all the patience and they finally got a picture. so now coworker is busy cropping the picture so its the correct size etc and karen is standing over him the whole time trying to tell him what to do and how to crop the photo like he doesnt do it every single day.normally, we take a customers picture  then they go take a seat to wait. i can see he's getting stressed so im like ""maam would you like to pay in the meantime while hes busy with your photos""she gives me the dirtiest look and says ""no we're busy mind your own business"". luckily, my boss was standing a few metres away and heard this and came over. ""maam im going to have to ask you to step behind the counter and wait while hes busy"" karen then immediately starts with ""you people are so rude! how can you speak to me like that!i cant even see my picture!"" and she storms behind the counter to pay, the whole time muttering to herself about how rude we are. so when she finally leaves my boss says 'have a nice day!' and she responds with 'go fuck yourselves"".

63,grocery store ginger lady,"i used to work in a grocery store in a small, depressed midwestern city with a drug problem. as you can imagine, our clientele could be a bit ""off."" i was working the registers alone late at night, and i had someone leave produce at my register. i had to abandon the registers after the customer left to quickly run the produce back to the produce section so it didn't spoil. 

i get back there, put it back on the cooler shelves, and quickly try to get back to the registers before another customer comes through. that's when someone grabs my arm. i turn to see a middle-aged white woman sporting dreadlocks and looking very spacey. oh no. she immediately starts ranting at me about how our ginger isn't fresh enough and the ""magic"" inside the ginger is already gone by the time it hits our shelves. she demands that we outline the entire supply chain of the ginger for her and make a plan to fix this, because the ""magic"" is important to her and her family and they need this ""ginger magic"" to cure all of their ""diseases of the mind and body."" this entire time, she is still holding onto my arm, she smells to high heaven, and people are starting to move toward the empty check-out area. 

i had to forcefully break free of her grasp and run to the checkouts to help people. she, of course, follows me to the registers, stands behind me, and continues ranting about how they will get sick and could die without the ""ginger magic"" and that i clearly don't care about her family's well-being, and that i might be responsible for deaths all over the city if i don't fix this right now. the customers checking out were really uncomfortable, as was i. i eventually had to call the night grocery manager from the back stock room. he told her to get lost or we would call the police. she was very pissed off and spent some time pacing the parking lot before finally leaving. i was very afraid she would show up again when i was alone up front at night, but i only saw her during the day after that, thank god!",Hey_its_me_your_mom,tfr

m: miss, i can't do that, i can print off your receipt and give you the contact information for ion but i can't give you anything else.

c: okay, here's my card, print off my receipt then!

m *searches information again and checks invoices*: i'm sorry miss, but i checked the 3 receipts for this item sold then and we don't have any reciepts what match the card number you gave me. and i can't verify the serial number without the packaging.

c: i don't care, print me off my receipt!

m: i can't do that, i have no proof this is your receipt and i'm not going to risk giving you other customers information. 

c: what was the price?

m: 2 were purchased at 200$ and one was purchased at 250$

c: i bought it for 250$. now print off my receipt and give me my money back.

m: miss, i already told you i'm not giving you your money back, and i can't give you the receipt unless you prove to me this was your receipt.

at this point it has started to get busy, i believe my coworker was on break and my manager was doing office work.

m: i have other things what i need to do

c: no! you haven't given me my money back

m: you aren't getting any money back, the best you can do is contact the manufacturer and they'll replace it.

c: i'm not getting a replacement i'm getting a refund. if you don't give me my money back i'm going to come back with my husband and he will throw this speaker at you!!

m: you have no right to speak to me like that, i'm going to have to ask you to leave.

66,"lady, you need to lay off the tony robbins","many years ago, i worked at a bookstore. this bookstore had a pretty lax return policy. if you had a receipt, we'd take it back. if you didn't have a receipt, as long as it was something we sold, we'd take it back in exchange for store credit. the only thing was, returns without a receipt required a manager's code in the computer. but it was no big deal, and the managers at my store rarely refused a return unless the book was seriously damaged or we just didn't carry the title, and they *always* took back books that still had our store sticker attached.

the store i worked at started all new hires off as cashiers for a month or two before letting them move up to bookseller, and this happened about a week after i started, so i was still pretty green, but i hadn't run into anything i couldn't handle.

enter the holy prophet of self esteem (hpose). she was nondescript, probably mid-40's, light brown hair, easy smile. she approached my register and pulled a book out of one of our bags.

hpose: i need to return this.

me: sure thing. do you have your receipt?

hpose: i don't. is that going to be problem?

me: (*flipping the book over and seeing one of our store's stickers*) not at all. it will have to be for store credit, though. that's our policy for returns without a receipt.

hpose: store credit is fine. i shop here all the time.

me: cool. i just need to ring the manager real quick to process the return.

hpose: (*looking miffed*) but i said store credit would be just!

me: yeah, the computer just needs a manager's code, and i'm just a cashier, so--

hpose: no!

at this point, i kind of freeze, not sure what to do. hpose's vehemence is totally out of proportion to needing a manager's code, and she's also looking at me like i just drop-kicked her favorite puppy.

hpose: you are not just a cashier! you have so much more worth as a person than this menial job! it's so sad what we've done to your generation, telling you that all you are is what you do for your employer, but you're more than a cashier. you're a person!

me: (laughing awkwardly) no, ma'am, i mean that i can't process your return on my own, because i'm a just cashier and the computer requires a--

hpose: you are not just a cashier!

me: ma'am, i need to call a manager to--

hpose: say you're not just a cashier!

me: ...i'm not just a cashier?

hpose: good. i bet you feel much better. now, can i please return my book?

me: (*very decidedly not feeling better*) sure, but i need to call my manager to process the return.

hpose: (*voice quavering, suddenly on the verge of tears*) but you said you weren't just a cashier! i thought you understood! you're more than this job! you have the ability to do this! i believe in you!

me: i really can't. the computer won't let me, because it needs a manager's code and i'm not a manager. i'm a cashier.

hpose: stop saying you're a cashier!

it was at this point that my manager came to my rescue. i'm not sure if the other cashier paged her or if she just overheard the commotion, but she calmly walked over and told me to move to the next register so she could finish processing hpose's return. hpose spent the entire time my manager was ringing up the return haranguing her for destroying her employees' sense of self-worth.

i don't know if hpose took her store credit to a different location or what, but i never saw her in our store again.",notoriousrdc,tfr
67,"lady lets me hold her baby monkey, turns out she's been arrested on monkey related charges","so, i work as a cashier at a big hardware store in the us.  i was closing last night, fairly routine night, when a lady comes up and said something to my co worker, i don't remember much, then invited us to look at her baby monkey.  he was a cute little guy, a six month old spider monkey named chico.  so of course we did what anyone would do when they see someone with a pet monkey in a country where monkeys are not out and about in the wild, we admire how cute he is and end up holding him somehow.

&amp;#x200b;

something about this woman struck me the wrong way though, she seemed a bit too eager for us to notice her monkey, like she enjoyed the attention, and i personally didn't like how rough she was making him look at the camera when we inevitably took pictures.  still, she seemed to know what she was doing, and in my state it's not illegal to have a pet monkey, so i ignored my gut for now.

&amp;#x200b;

after she left, my head cashier came back up to the front and we told her what happened.  it turns out this woman was a regular, and had a different spider monkey in the past.  it turns out had been arrested at some point because her previous monkey had attacked someone...  at a hardware store!  (our direct competitor no less)  not only that, but she fled the state to ours (the incident happened in florida of course, we're in nc), and she was extradited back to florida to face charges.  i don't know what happened after that, all articles i can find are just talking about the arrest, but i know they took her previous 8 year old monkey (named spanky).  and i guess she just....  got a new one?  that incident happened in june of last year, but i can't believe she managed to get another monkey after that.

&amp;#x200b;

sadly nothing else too interesting happened after that, she eventually bought a rug and left the store, and i couldn't help but be left hoping chico was being properly cared for.  he was a great little monkey, sleepy and well behaved, but his human just gave me bad vibes, especially now that i know about her previous charges.",Sonic10122,tfr
68,why i should not interact with customers without sleep.,"hi guys, thought i would share a funny anecdote from one of my early morning shifts.

this happened a while ago but for some reason i just remembered it. let it be said that i should not be allowed around customers when i've only had a few hours sleep.

so my store opens at 5.45 every morning barring major holidays (christmas &amp; easter). for whatever reason i had not slept well the night before, so i was basically a walking zombie in self-serve (we had opened it early that morning, but i don't remember why). at that time of the morning we generally don't get a lot of customers, so i didn't have to deal with many people while i woke up. 

so this one guy comes in, and i'm fairly certain he got about as much sleep as i had because he was having trouble locating tomatoes on his screen. seeing this i showed him how to navigate the menu (arranged alphabetically) and enter his tomatoes for him. this is where the amusement comes in.

him: so is that tomatoes? (points at menu)

me: (brain not working)…. that's the alphabet.

him:... \*blinks\*… ok.

me: \*internally\* i am such a dumbass.

he left a minute later.

not a confrontation, just two very tired people having a moment.

this elderly couple comes walking up and i hear ""does your mama know youre smoking"" and my gut reaction was anger because idgaf about my mom and whether she cares if i have a cigarette(i post a lot on justnomil) but slapped on a smile and tried to joke back with him.

when they got inside, he didnt stick around but went over to the deli next door to order their food. no biggie. doesnt bother me. happens almost evry customer. what botherd me is that his wife was literally in the store talking about all her pain and all that and walking with a cane and he didnt even handle the door for her to help her out.  i dont know their relationship so maybe shes a nagger or a liar or somrthing but it made me feel bad so i made sure i held the door for her when she left.",rainbohprincess,tfr
70,making appointments.,"this guy called me, he asked if he needed an appointment, i told him yes. otherwise, our wait times could be an hour. he then, continued to argue with me about this. like it's not my store policy or anything. some background: i sell products that can take about 30 minutes at least to fit. that being said, we close at 5 on saturdays, we cannot take fittings past 4:30pm. we open at 10 and close at 6 every other day. 

him: ""well, my schedule is pretty much open 24/7/365. so i can just come in whenever i please.""

him: ""but, i can get there before you even open, and you'll have to fit me since i'll be the first person there.""

me: ""not if we have an appointment at 10, which we often do. i'm sorry, but i'll need you to make an appointment.""

him: ""well, i do not ever remember, and i dont even own a clock, so appointments are no good for me.""

me: ""right, but it is also for us and our other clients, so if you could...""

him: ""well, i'm headed out now from kern county, so i'll be there in an hour.""

*at this point it is 3:45pm on a saturday. 

me: ""that will not give us enough time for your fitting, as we do not take fittings after 4:30pm on saturdays. out fittings take at least 30 minutes, which would put me past closing.""

him: ""oh, it shouldn't take that long to close your store. can't you just stay later for me?""

me: ""no, i cannot. we are scheduled to be off by a certain time, and i am not authorized to do overtime. this is policy. so, if you would like, let's set up your appointment.""

71,the fitting room is a crazy place," hello all just thought i'd share my rather... interesting experiences. my apologizes for any formatting issues, i am a first time poster.

 to give you some background these all happened while working the fitting room at a certain popular store that caters to those around the age of 21. it was a job that ranged from either painfully boring on our slow days to absolute hell on other days. to sum up my duties i was to run clothing items out and to proper spots while still keeping an eye on the fitting room customers to make sure no one was stealing or doing anything crazy. a two-three person job that i often did alone. 

 now i often saw people stepping out of there dressing rooms to go talk to someone standing close by or in another dressing room room in various stages of undress. however one woman takes the cake. she had been trying on clothes and apparently needed whatever her friend was carrying for her. rather than call her friend or get dressed to go find her this lady proceeded to walk out of the fitting room and across the store in her bare feet wearing nothing but a small black slip, carrying her heels and her purse in her hands. i was too shocked to even think about stopping her.

 part of my job was enforcing our strict 'one person per fitting room' rule. one day a young couple, a guy and girl, came into the fitting room. the girl had one item, which she had grabbed upon seeing that i was standing in the fitting room. i direct them to the nearest open fitting room and inform them of the one person rule when they attempt to enter it together. they're pretty chill and the guy waits outside her door while she tries on the item. at this point another person has placed a small stack of unwanted items on the rack which i promptly go to return to their proper places. by the time i return to the fitting room the guy and the girl are not where i left them, but i can hear some 'happy sounds' coming from the large handicapped fitting stall all the the way at the back. i go and inform the person in stall of the one person rule and to my ""great surprise"" it is the girl and her boyfriend from earlier who answer. after a solid 10 minutes both sheepishly depart looking rather disheveled. 

 (warning: this one is rather gross) i think the worst thing that has ever happened though is the time i had to clean pee off the floor. you see shoplifting was a common issue in the store and some people were under the mistaken impression that you could somehow remove the sensors by ""putting certain liquids on them"".  about thirty minutes before closing time i am rerurning from running unwanted items back out to the salesfloor when i discover a pungent odor coming from a fitting room stall that, though vacated, had a closed door. i open it to discover a pile of wet sweaters sitting amongst a large puddle. i immediately close off the stall and inform my manager who looks at me like i'm stupid for informing her of the situation. as i threw away the sweaters and mopped the floor i decidedly that i needed to start seeking employment elsewhere. 

 that's all for now, i may share more stories later down the road.",TheRetailLady,tfr
72,that’s not what you think it is,"not insanely eventful but it gave me a good laugh, so here goes. obligatory “i’m on mobile” disclaimer, you get it. 

 so, i work in the bakery department. our stock is right next to the produce department, which isn’t always staffed because once they’ve put everything out, their need for people is low. i get people all the time asking about things on coupon, etc. 

 one guy flags me down while i’m putting out some muffins and goes as follows. om - old man, me - well, me. 

 om; can you go in the back and get me a fresher cantaloupe? those ones look bad. 

 me; oh! let me get someone in produce for you, i work in a different department. 

 i check everywhere for the produce employee, realizing it’s after 5 and he’s nowhere to be found. he’s gone for the day. i make my way back to the old man, who is now holding a honeydew angrily. they’re placed right next to the cantaloupe but clearly labeled. 

 me: sir? our produce employee is gone for the day, and i don’t have access to their stock. but i assure you all stock as been put out today and that’s what’s left.

73,"no ma'am, iv'e been here since august.","so i'm more of a lurker of this sub and not really the type to post anything. so with that being said, this is my first post, so sorry for any grammar errors or typos. 

   so for some background to this story, i work at a department store at my local mall. it's one of those ones that has a credit card you can sign up for and when you do you get a coupon that's only valid for 24 hrs and you can use it on different purchases at a different location. all of the coupons for the store except the ones we have in our store are a one time use only and we are suppose to throw them away instead of giving it back to the customer. our registers won't even let us scan and apply the discount if it's expired or has been used it'll just say this discount cannot be applied or certificate has been redeemed. so i can't do anything about it. however under certain circumstances we can apply the discount but we need to call an lod if we can't do it ourselves, some cashiers can, but i am not one who can. anyways i had the pleasure of dealing with a ""karen"". i was hanging around the register because i was helping with go-backs and oh boy, everyone and their moms were trying on clothes that day. i was hanging up some of the clothes that needed to be hung up while talking to my co-worker when this lady came up to one of the registers wanting to buy two bras, which she claimed they were on the clearance rack, they weren't, they did have a buy one get one 50% off though. i didn't need to go over and look because i knew the sale because i work in the lingerie department a lot of the times. this is how the conversation went down;

rc(rude customer): i found these on the clearance rack

me: well i'm not sure they are on clearance, but i can check for you. \*scans item\* okay so it looks like they aren't on clearance, but they are buy one get one 50% off. do you still want them?

rc: do these qualify for the coupons?

me: yes these ones do. 

rc: i'll take them. i have this coupon i was told i could use next time i come in&gt;

me: \*notices it's the coupon we give to people sign up for the credit card\*\*looks at the date written on the thing\*

the date was over a month ago at the time of this purchase so idk why she signed up for the card when she doesn't come in regularly. most people who do come in at least once a week.

me: oh i'm sorry this coupon is only valid for 24 hrs once you applied for the card but i can see if it'll let me scan it\*scans the coupon, screen pops up with the certificate has already been redeemed thing\* yeah i'm sorry but it won't let me apply the discount. 

keep in mind this lady had a very thick arabian accent so it was hard to understand her at times

rc: i was told i can use it next time i come into the store!

me: yes and i'm sorry you were misinformed, but it won't let me apply the discount.

rc: \*said something about scanning it and i thought she meant her temporary credit card because it was hard to understand her\*

me: okay so it's going to want you to sign the blue box on the card reader and i am going to need to see your state issued id card.

rc: are you new here?

me: no, i've been here since august. 

i said that in the most annoying cheerful voice ever for some reason

rc: i'm just gonna come back when someone knows what their doing.

me: alright, have a nice day.

thank god i didn't see her after that. this happened in the beginning of february and i haven't seen her since so i wonder if she ever canceled her credit card with us. it's always the people who have our credit card that are the rudest, most uneducated people i've come across also this is my first job ever and my first one in retail as well so i'm kinda new to the whole getting yelled at when someone is standing two inches from your face and you can smell their bad breath. also, yes, i do indeed know what i'm doing. i was trained for it. and i am told everyday by my bosses how to improve my performance.

74,man humps stairs in diy store,"i worked at a diy store. this happened when i was walking with a customer to show him a product. our store had a cafe above the shop floor with a flight of stairs on the side. the stairs were separated into two flights by a platform halfway through. 

as we walked to the product, i looked up and saw a man in his 20’s on the stairs in a position similar to the one people do push ups in, with his legs on the platform and hands on one of the steps above. his pants were about halfway off and he was humping the stairs. luckily you couldn’t actually see his genitals from that viewing angle. there was also another man, of a similar age, who looked like a friend of his, standing on his left looking at him. 

after seeing this i paused for a moment, the customer also stopped and looked at me. i realised that he hadn’t seen the guy and was wondering why i stopped. instead of exposing him to that sight, i continued walking as if nothing had happened. we had to walk under the stairs in order to get to the product (i made sure we didn’t walk directly under that guy). 

as we were about to walk under i looked to the left and saw one of our supervisors and one of our managers both standing at the base of the stairs, looking at the guy with absolute confusion. we got to the product and after a 5 minute conversation about it, i went back to my post. looked at the stairs on the way back, but the guy was gone. 

later that day, i asked the supervisor what happened. he said the guy kept doing that for about another minute and then got up and went up to the cafe as if nothing had happened. they got the security guards to escort him and his friend out. they were compliant and security didn’t ask any questions. i think it was probably a dare or something. what do you guys think?",bobi6192,tfr

since christmas was nearing, the store was filled with customers and the line ran from the start of our queue line almost to the fitting room, halfway across the store. i'm rushing through customers ringing them out as quickly as i can to try and get the line a little more manageable and up comes one of our regular problem causers, let's call her **crazy customer** (referred to as cc). she's come in multiple times prior to this and caused some general problems with our staff such as saying they stole their credit cards, over charging her, etc... the normal crazy stuff that batshit crazy people do in public.

of course, i manage to get her at my register. she has one of our bags in her left hand and thirty receipts in the other. our interaction went somewhere along the lines of this:

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;**cc:** *hands me her state issued id, takes off her hat and glasses*   
&gt;  
&gt;does it look like me?

this is when i felt things start getting sketchy so i have my front end supervisor hang around nearby just in   
case all hell breaks loose.

&gt;  
&gt;*scans the swim suits and takes out a store credit, hands her the id back*  
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: what were you typing from my licence into the computer?

at this point i knew she was going to cause a problem. i'm fully aware that she's made returns without her   
receipts in the past and is fully aware that i have to do this.

&gt;**cc**: i don't feel comfortable with that, can you just give me the money and delete me from your system?   
&gt;  
&gt;**me**: i've already put it all in and started processing the return, i can't just delete it, the computer doesn't let me.

&gt;**me**: *pages my manager via my annoying little motorola radio*  
&gt;  
&gt;**mg (manager)**: what's goi-  
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: he stole my personal information! he took my licence and started writing down all of my information! 

i pull the manager aside a few inches and explain why i had her id and that she doesn't understand.

&gt;**mg**: ma'am, for us to do a return without receipt the computer makes us collect information from you to prevent abuse of the system.   
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: he has my name and knows where i live now! this isn't right!  
&gt;  
&gt;**mg**: we don't store your information here, and the computer sends it to corporate instantly, he doesn't have access to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: he saw it! how long has he worked here? i want his name and **his (unintelligible but pretty sure she meant social security number)** he's a criminal!   
&gt;  
&gt;**mg**: i'm not giving you that information.   
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: he's trying to steal my identity so that he can come to my house ***and kill me!***   
&gt;  
&gt;**mg**: no he's not. i'll finish your return without your information and give you store credit.  
&gt;

&gt;**cc**: how can you return it without my id if the computer requires you to put it in? i told you he was lying and trying to get my info!!!  
&gt;  
&gt;**mg**: *attempts to explain that she put her own (mgr's) information in instead*  
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: i'm bringing the police to have him arrested. 

and she left... for a solid 15 minutes.

then she came back..

&gt;**cc**: *walks in door and walks right up to me while i'm helping a customer*

&gt;  
&gt;**me**: *points at name tag* my name is sam.   
&gt;  
&gt;**cc**: okay *sam,* i just wanted to tell you that you're doing such an amazing job. enjoy it while you have it. 

and... she left again.

no cops ever came and i've ceased to see her come into our store since.

76,twilight zone,"this story is a little long but worth the read.

this day will forever be etched into my brain. i was working as loss prevention for a well known retail store in the south. i had been on my job for about 8 months so i knew all the tactics needed to catch shop lifters. for example viewing them on the panels our stores would have on the ceiling, so i do not have to be on the aisle with them and can secretly watch them, etc.

the store i was at was on a bad part of town and of course that is why they needed loss prevention. one day this lady comes in who used to be a regular. i always had a feeling she was stealing, but i could never catch her. i would always catch the aftermath of either opened packages or items hid away for someone to come back later which could have been anyone so i couldn't prove it was her in particular doing this. well one day i had nothing to do and it was slow. i cant usually watch people for more than 5 minutes before having to watch someone else because the theft was that bad. so this day i watched her go from aisle to aisle. she started in the make up and worked her way down the aisles. i finally saw her put some face care items in her purse and i thought ""ok now! here we go, some action."" so i come around the corner like chris hansan and say, "" ma'am i saw you put those items in your purse, i am going to need them back or you can pay for them up front."" she says its nothing in here and shows me her purse. the bottom is completely empty. i know i'm not crazy i just watched her put them in her purse. so now i am shaking because if she goes to corporate and report me i could lose my job for a ""bad stop"" plus i was so excited to catch her i didnt even wait until she crossed the last point of sale. she insist i get her purse and look in it. i dont because i cant touch any physical property of the customers and plus i dont know if a needle or something is in there. i apologize and let her go on her way. she left rather fast after that. i told the manager and discussed it with other loss prevention people. i concluded that this was my first time experiencing someone who had a false bottom purse.

77,"""i am not breaking the law and risking my career for you""","i work in the uk as an optometrist, and generally tend to work for independent chains. i spend 95% of my time examining patients, so tend not to get involved with the retail side. 

anyhow, one quiet afternoon, a gentleman walks in (lets call him nm, for nasty man), and starts chatting to the receptionist (lets call her lr, for lovely receptionist). i can hear the interchange from my office:

&gt;nm: i would like to buy a set of glasses please

&gt;lr: sure thing, are you registered with us?

&gt;nm: no, i have just moved to the area

&gt;lr: ok, when did you last have your eyes tested?

&gt;nm: about 4 years ago.

&gt;lr: i see, in that case you will need to get your eyes tested as your last prescription will be out of date.

&gt;nm: now, now, now my lovely. do not start playing silly fun and games with me here. *(said in a very nasty and patronising manner)*

&gt;lr: *(obviously taken aback)* i am sorry sir, but i am not trying to play any games here.

&gt;nm: *(starting to speak quite nastily)* you are being very unhelpful in response to a simple demand. now it is very simple, you obviously have the equipment to check the power in my current glasses, just use that ok?

&gt;lr: i'm really sorry sir, but i am not allowed to do that

at this point, i have heard enough and leave my office and come out to reception to intervene. i try to calm down the situation and explain that what he is requesting would be illegal. i offer to give him a (free nhs) test that day. however he point blank refuses and asks me to fabricate the test, and issue him with a new prescription (once again illegal). once we have gone around in circles for a few minute, we came to the final exchange:

&gt;me: so let me get this straight, you want me to pretend to examine you, and sell you glasses which are the same power as your old ones?

&gt;nm: *(huffs and puffs in triumph)* yes! thank goodness we have got there in the end!

&gt;me: so in short, you are requesting that i; fabricate medical data, issue a false prescription, defraud the nhs, and potentially risk my professional registration and career. is there anything else you would like me to do today?

&gt;nm: *(not even a hint of shame)* no, that will be fine by me

&gt;me: i am not breaking the law and risking my career for you. you have been very rude to myself and my colleague here. please leave the store, and do not return. your custom is not wanted here. 

&gt;nm: *(obviously gob smacked that i stood up to him)* oh, ok. *(then subsequently walks out)*

i have never experienced anything like this before or afterwards. to put things very simply, all he needed to do was to sit for an exam for 25 minutes, and i could've issued him with a brand new prescription and gladly made him up a set of glasses.

tldr: nasty customer asks me to break law, and risk my own career over a set of glasses. ",low_myope,tfr
78,"in which a woman takes out a shaver, shaves a man’s face, puts the shaver back in the box, and puts the box back on the shelf.","me, ten feet away, putting up toothbrushes: ...🤔 *picture everything i say in a very monotone voice, the entire time. it’s a bargain store, i’m used to shenanigans, this lady is nothing new.*

i walk over, “ma’am, is that the one you just used?”

“yes, well, no, well.. i was just seeing if it worked.”

me: “okay, you’ll have to purchase it.

“what? no. what? i didn’t open it. it was already opened. how do you know?”

me: “because, i was right there, i saw you.”

“i just run it near his face. i didn’t use it. i just wanted to know if it worked because i got another one before and it didn’t work. i’m buying this one” *points to a different one in her cart*

me: “okay well that’s a form of theft... we can’t sell the product after it’s been used. would you buy a razor that’s been used?”

“what?! who you talkin to?! how do you know? were you watching me?!” (she’s talking over me a lot and there isn’t too much of a logical back and forth, just more random things she shouts out)

me: “i was just right over there the whole time.”

“what do you care?! like this is your store? what like you own the place? what does it matter to you!! it’s not your job”

me: “it is my job to call out theft.”

“oh *scoffs* you just gonna harass customers?! please. go. go get someone!!! go get a manager.”

me: ...

“come on now *scoffs*” 

(keeps going back and forth *with herself* before taking off toward the front, i just shrug and follow her)

(she gets in line, i page for the store manager. i know how this will go, but just for the principle of the thing i pursue it.)

he walks up, i walk over to him as does crazy lady. i go to start talking and she abruptly cuts me off, trying to act like a normal person but she doesn’t know how, so it comes out funny.

me: “so,-“

“-this was already opened, and i just wanted to know if it worked. so i get it out the package and just run it over my hand, that’s it, and put it back.” (meanwhile the shaver is in my hand, with his facial hair still on it.)

me: ...*sigh* “she opened the box, took out the shaver, shaved his face with it, put it back in the box and back on the shelf.”

store manager: (he’s a good boss, but obviously these situations are tricky) ... “okay,” (turns to me) “just mos it and throw it away”

me: “okay”

then the lady got back in line and wouldn’t stop mouthing off. “i bet you’re puttin’ things in ya pocket!!!” 

me: (one lane over, marking it out of stock) “you’re accusing me of stealing because you got caught stealing?”

*scoffs* “harassing me.” (at some point she turned to my coworker checking her out) “she must be new here.”

my coworker didn’t skip a beat: “no. do you have a reward’s card?”

i guess it’s true: a thief believes everyone steals. 🤷🏽‍♀️



tl;dr woman uses a shaver and tries to put it back on the shelf. her story keeps changing and she attacks me, accusing me of watching her, of lying, and of stealing myself.

79,yes this is a child. you still have to pay.,"all right, disclaimer first i guess

\- english is not my first language. there might be spelling / grammatical errors

\- i'm fairly new to reddit. there might be posting errors.

therefore i apologize for any fuss caused.

&amp;#x200b;

this is one of many stories i originally posted in german in a blog at a german community website. i used to call these blogs ""kassengeflüster"" which roughly translates to ""whispering at the till"" or ""till talks"". 

probably unnecessary intro done.

&amp;#x200b;

the store where i received my training at wasn't very large and a square floor so practically every corner was in hearing distance from the cash register. i was alone for an hour during my superior's lunch break.

a mother (m) with her child (k) came into the store; m went straight for the clothing racks while k looked at the shelves with toys for a while. this lady has been in the store before and we have asked her multiple times to watch her child since k tends to look at the toys almost exclusively with her hands inside the packaging.

&amp;#x200b;

k then took several of the toys to m asking to buy it. m declined multiple times and k got more and more upset about it. 

after being told to put a selected toy back repeatedly, k looked and sounded like on the verge of a tantrum so m hastily told her to just unpack the toy and play with it on the store floor, simply to keep her quiet i guess.

k gleefully ripped the packing open and played quietly next to m. i made a note to self that i would add it to m's bill.

&amp;#x200b;

sure enough, m got done clothes shopping, puts them in her cart, told k they are leaving and on her way out, put the toy in the opened packaging back on the shelf. before she got to the register i went around the shelf, took the toy and put it on the table (we didn't have conveyor belts).

the conversation at the cash register went as follows:

&amp;#x200b;

me: i'm sorry madam but have to ask you to pay for this toy. we can't reseal the packaging like this.

&amp;#x200b;

m: *helplessly points at k*

&amp;#x200b;

m: but... this is a child!

&amp;#x200b;

me: so i see. but this toy is unfit for sale now.

&amp;#x200b;

m: but... this! is a child!

&amp;#x200b;

me: i would not ask you if we didn't have to remind you to take care before.

&amp;#x200b;

m: you don't understand - this is a child!

&amp;#x200b;

me: of course she's a child! doesn't look like a dog to me!

&amp;#x200b;

i knew then and i know now that this was a rude response but her ""*this is a young child so of course she will grab and unpack stuff and why do you expect me to take responsibility*"" attitude was just infuriating.

&amp;#x200b;

m managed some more stammering and mumbling but in the end she paid for the toy. didn't even seem to be too upset with me or with k. also, she did come back to the store several times after so we didn't even lose a customer over this situation.",TheTillTalks,tfr
80,"""i know the guy who owns this place!""","(long) sorry this post is long! 
tl;dr at the bottom. i'm on mobile so i apologize for any typos or wrong auto correct!

i manage a locally owned store where we deal in used goods of the video game variety. being a small business dealing in used goods, we have certain policies in place for a reason. most of our customers understand and dont harass us about them but not this guy. we'll call him ac for annoying customer.


ac enters our store and walks up to the front counter where my associate and myself are working. we greet ac and he asks how much we pay out for an xbox one. i explain our store policy which is that we need to see all items in person to give out any quotes. 

ignoring what i just stated, ac proceeds to tell us about how he really doesn't want to sell it. it's just taking up space and not being used, so he asks for a price range. i again explain to ac how we need to see the item and dont give quotes because there are quite a few things that go into the numbers we give out that we need to see the condition for. i again state that we'd be more than happy to take a look at it if ac just brings it into the store.

ac starts to get upset. he raises his voice a bit and says,  ""look, i know you can give me a number. it's already in your computer. just tell me what the screen says for an xbox one."" i try to explain to him that our system doesn't work that way and that we look everything up manually in real time so i can't give a number without seeing the items in question. ac doesn't let me finish explaining and interrupts asking me to just look it up on ebay or whatever and give him the lowest we'd offer.

by this time i'm done trying to be nice. i tend to get people trying to get me to be a push over and it really bothers me. so i tell him once more that we have our policies for a reason and everyone is treated the same. 

ac then starts going off about how i'm being rude and denying him a service. being highly annoyed, i inform him that i have a right to refuse service and that he can just not bring his items in because we will no longer be buying anything from him. ac starts chuckling to himself. ac then says ""oh man, you really messed up now. you don't even know. i know the guy who owns this place! you're  the manager here, yeah?"" 

i proceed to tell him yes. ac asks for my name and keeps prattling off how he's going to contact them and how i've messed up big time about refusing him a service. i then tell him ihave the right to refuse service to anyone and that he is no longer welcome in the store and to please leave.

ac has to have one final word in""you wont see me again in this store! because you wont  have a job anymore!"" he says as he finally leaves the store. 

i proceeded to send a picture of the guy from our camera footage to the owner; who i know quite well. he tells me he's never met the guy.



tl;dr  customer comes store demanding a quote for his game console. when refused due to store policy, threatens my job by claiming to know the owner. owner doesn't recognize him.



edit:fixing types and some clarification on why we dont give quotes to customers. in the past we've had people get upset and leave us bad reviews for lying about quotes. when somebody describes their item as pristine condition, it more often than not is not in pristine condition when they bring it in so the quote we gave for a pristine item is no longer valid. we look up everything at the moment its brought in so the amounts are always varying. sometimes a game spikes in value which may or may not go in a customers favor. sometimes a controller isn't working or it's a third party brand we dont take. they may be missing cords, etc. so we have a strict policy about seeing items in person. this is posted on our floor with our hours as well as our online site.

81,"in for the $, away on the £.","so i used to work in a call support centre for an online retailer that specialised in web delivery of vision care products worldwide. one of my tasks was to provide e-mail support, which i liked doing, as i avoided talking to customers over the phone.

the american branch shut down ages before i was hired, and as a result, our customers from over the pond had to buy from the uk site. before purchasing, the uk site lets customers in the us know exactly what the price will be in us (but to be fair to them, this was in brackets, and can be easily ignored).

so my email interaction with this customer (lets call her ak for american karen) and myself (me) would be one of the most hilarious tales from retail:

ak - excuse me?! i am writing to you because you overcharged me! i used your site because i thought i would get the best price for my lenses!

me - i can certainly help you ma’am, what’s the issue?

ak - when i saw xyz lenses, it was 15 with a “broken dollar” sign. total came to 24 dollars with shipping. i just looked at my credit card bill and it shows $32 dollars with an international charge rate making me pay $36 in total. i demand to be refunded $12.

me - broken dollar sign? you mean this sign: “£”

ak - yes, that’s the sign i saw, the broken dollar sign.

me - ma’am i’m sorry to inform you, but that’s the british pound sign. when you use our site, you see the value in pound sterling with an estimated conversion next to it in your currency.

ak - oh......can i still be refunded? that wasn’t clear on the site!

i spoke with my boss at the time and as a gesture of good will, we partially refunded the order to compensate ak’s surcharge. to this day though, i still find it funny how someone referred to the pound sign as “broken dollar sign”.",keikoandgilly,tfr
82,awkward experience in the fitting room,"i work at a clothing store where i come into contact with many customers whose actions i find to be inappropriate. during my first few months of working there, i was stationed i the fitting room, the usual spot they had me working and i had a customer wave me over who was standing in one of the doors of a dressing room. she looked like a lady i her mid-thirties who seemed to be shopping with her significant other. she asked me if the yellow shirt she was wearing looked okay on her and then she walked to the fitting room and stood in front of the mirror so she could get another look at herself in it. i said i liked it and then she had me come in the fitting room (with the door still open) and held up me the same shirt but in black and said it’s the same size but it fit differently, which i thought was odd. she must have thought that i didn’t believe her because she then walked around me to shut the fitting room door (we were then in this tiny room alone together) and she started putting this black shirt on to prove to me that it looked different. now, i did not know this lady, yet i still got to see a glimpse of her nipples and it was the most awkward experience of my life. all i could think of it why didn’t she invite her s.o. in there with her, instead of me. 

 when she finally put he shirt on i told her it did look different a that she should get the yellow shirt instead and i booked it out of there, hoping no one would see me coming out of the closed fitting room with a customer. this lady did not see anything wrong with what had happed but i was so embarrassed and confused how i let myself get into the situation. it made me pretty warry when other customers would ask me for help in the fitting room in the future.",ajevans7,tfr
83,the persistent haggler in a non haggler society.,"this happened many years ago when i used to work at an eclectic homeware store.

this area had a high percentage of immigrants from countries where haggling is very common. easy enough to deal with more often then not and being able to speak multiple dialects (not all very well) did help with any confusion.

about an hour before closing time i had an older woman come in looking at a vase. she will be called ph for persistent haggler. i'll be m for me. 

ph: how much? 

m: the price is marked on the item.

ph: $40? no, no, $20.

m: sorry but i can't sell bellow the marked price. it says $40 so that's how much it will cost.

ph: i will only pay $20.

m: *takes her over to our $20 vases* these are $20 perhaps have a look at these.

ph: fine $25.

m: i'm sorry it's $40.

ph: no! *walks away*

m: ok, have a nice day.

these interactions weren't uncommon and aren't bad, sometimes a little frustrating when it's one after the other all day long but it's just down to cultural differences. 

about 5 minutes before the store closes the lady comes back. she picks up the vase and puts it on the counter.

i scan it and tell her the total is $40.

ph: no, i pay you $25.

m: no, it's $40. if you don't want to pay that much then you need to get something else.

she stand there staring at me for a few beats.

m: i have to start closing up the shop. if you don't want to buy it that's ok.

ph: fine $30. no more.

m: $40 or you can leave without it.

ph: naughty girl. *storms off*

84,customer threatened to beat me bc they weren't happy with their picture.,"i've only posted here once before, but there are so many crazy customers that come to my store. my store is an art store, gallery and framing business. now thankfully this happened while my boss and her boyfriend was there, if this had happened while i was alone i wouldn't know what to do. also english isn't my first language so sorry 

so maybe a year ago a customer came in and wanted to stretch up a canvas. she wanted the canvas to be stretched in a way so that the picture would be around the edges. i explained to her that if we did this about 2cm on each side would go around the edge which would make the picture appear a bit smaller. she told me this was ok. as i made her order my boss walked up to me and whispered 'make sure she pays 50% beforehand'. usually if the order isn't too big people can decide to pay when they pick their pictures up, but my boss had a gut feeling.

so about a week goes by and she comes back to get her picture. as soon as she sees it i can tell she isn't happy. the top of her husband's head is wrapped around the edge as well as a piece of a beach, but it was still a nice picture in my opinion. 

she freaks out and wants us to do it over. my boss explains she would have to come back with new pictures and pay again. this just makes her even more mad and she gets her husband on the phone. she hands the phone to me and he starts calling me incompetent and an idiot and so many other things (we've won championships in framework, and museums and plenty of semi-famous people use our services.). they ask why we didn't call to double check if they wanted his head to 'disappear' and we explained that technically nothing was wrong and that i had explained this to them beforehand.

we hang up on the husband, and he calls our company phone. he explains that he has so many brothers and that we should be careful, and that they were going to come down and 'get us'. 

finally after being yelled at for so long the boyfriend of my boss grabs the pictures and almost throws them at her saying 'i'll pay for this out of my pocket, but you need to leave now. you've waisted enough of our time'

she walked away and thankfully we never saw them again, but i did have nightmares about them showing up when i was alone at work. when we work alone we don't have a security system that can get assistance easily should anything happen or if i'm in danger. and it has happened that people have come in with knives and we had to rely on people outside calling the cops.",shseglem,tfr

90,“i just need a few”,"short story, but a great experience indeed.

so i am working at the kiosk/customer service desk at a supermarket in my town. one of the biggest chains in the country.

today at work, when the extremely busy hours of a saturday has passed, one of the regular old ladies walk up to me and asks for a pack of cigarettes. 

immediately after selling the cigarettes to her, she process to grab a few out of the pack. 

customer: “do you know anyone working here that smokes?”

me: “yeah, i and a few others do.”

at this point, the only smokers around were me, one of my friends who’s sitting at the first register, and one who’s at break.

customer: “i only need a few of these, since my husband insists on me quitting. i’m just sneaking out to have a few smokes before going back home.”

she then proceeded to offer me the rest of the pack of cigarettes, where i naturally ask if she’s sure about wanting to give them away.

customer: “yes, they’d be going in the trash otherwise.”

as far as i’m concerned, we’re not allowed to take “gifts” from the customers, but none of the supervisors were around and that makes me the one in control of my entire department. i accept the pack of cigarettes and thank her. 

we then proceeded to split the cigarettes between us, putting them in our own packs.

now, i know that this old lady loves coming to our store, and i’ve never heard her be rude to anyone here. naturally, we’re all very nice to this type of customer, and this just shows that it pays off to take extra good care of your regulars.

91,you're annoying but amazing.,"i have a weird memory and remember the weirdest things. i remember which of my customers speak english or french, i remember what cigarettes they buy and what things they usually buy if they always buy the same things. i often know what is going on in their lives and who their kids are and whatnot. people are always commenting about my ability to remember random details, i chalk it up to being an avid reader for most of my life. 

one of my customers last night comes in, he is a regular and just a pain in the ass. he is always bitter with me and never in a good mood. yet with all of the other cashiers he smiles and laughs and talks with them. whatever, there are customers i love and others i detest part of life as a cashier. i mention something about him and his wife having changed cigarette brands awhile back and that the price of the old brand went down. 

customer: by 'you guys' you mean the cigarettes my wife smokes?

me: i guess, i don't remember exactly which one of you bought them usually. 

customer: you know if i had a business i would hire you in a minute and i would make millions. you're amazing. 

me: uh...

customer: but you're annoying you know? 

me: (mentally what? how am i annoying? for the most part with you i never go above and beyond the necessary things for the transaction) ok....

customer: but you're amazing because you remember everything.

me: i read a lot, and with books you have to retain the information.

customer: i read a lot too but i don't have a memory like you.

customer: i would hire you in a minute...

and he leaves with me thinking that even if he wanted to hire me i would never work for him. how is saying i'm annoying a compliment? what did he expect me to say, thank you? one of my weirdest interactions with a customer in 6 years. ",readersanon,tfr
92,"""explain to me why i'm in the wrong country!""","just happened. i run a store that is in a city with the same name as a canadian city. we are 4 hours apart and it can be confusing for some people. 

let me be honest. i am not great with directions. i get easily frustrated when people call for directions because it is very easy to  use google maps to get to where you're going. i also get nervous that i might tell them the wrong direction.

ci=canadian idiot
i get this lovely phone call:


me: hello!

ci: i need help finding out where to go

me: sure, where are you at right now

ci: 2nd and main st.

me: that is really close! we are on 17th and main st. so just keep going and you can't miss our sign

ci: but you're at 1707 right?

me: yes.

ci: then why the hell am i by a building that is 1785.

me: (confused) i am not sure

ci: explain to me whats going on

me: i am not sure. but we are at 17th and main, so just keep heading down the st.

ci: not until you explain to me what's going on. do you know this fucking city at all?

me: yes sir, i do.

ci: i'm by science world (a place i have never heard of) so where am i?

me: i am not sure, i have not heard of science world

ci: oh fuck you, did you just move here?

me: sir, i cannot help if you are going to be frustrated and swear at me

ci: learn the fucking city idiot

i was super confused about this and googled science world, he was in canada! a different country and had the nerve to yell at me.

93,customer starts yelling at me before i can explain,"i work in a small dollar store that sells lots of home goods that ranges from stationary to food, our return/exchange policy isn't the best, and none of the workers agree with it but there really isn't much we can do about that on our part.

so a customer around his mid 40s - 50s comes in with his 12-14 year old son. he's trying to buy this storage organizer, but before i even begin scanning his things he looks angry already -- i just assumed he was having a bad day or that was just his face, so i checked his items out as i would normally, minus the small talk.

right as you come up to the register counter, there is a giant screen that tells you the price of each item in giant text, similar to most stores these days. so i finish ringing him up, telling him the return policy (no refund/exchange) and then he looks at the screen showing the price and pays, and then about 30 seconds later, he says "" this product says it's $3.99 on the shelf.""

so i walk over to the aisle where the product was supposed to be, and surely enough it was $3.99, but the part about my job that i completely disagree with is that i can't adjust prices to be the ""right"" price for customers, because that's just the  company policy is. normally when this happens i'll just refund the customer even though it's final sale to avoid getting yelled at. the price that he paid for was $5.99, and he wanted the $3.99 price.

so i start to explain to him that i couldn't give him the cheaper price, and here is how the conversation went:

c will be customer, and i'll just be me.

&amp;#x200b;

me: sorry i can't--

c: this is ridiculous, you guys messed up so i deserve this price

me: yes i understand, but i can't--

c: you're not hearing me (increasingly more loud) 

me: no, i understand completely but i can tell you what i can do for you--

c: let me speak with your manager

&amp;#x200b;

what i was trying to explain to him was that i couldn't give him the price, but what i could've done was that he could've picked any other item in the store with the same price, or that i could've given him a full refund, but he didn't even want to hear what i had to say.

so i just froze up there and just walked away, mainly because he was being so rude and because i don't do well with people yelling at me. i couldn't even get more than half a sentence out to explain to him without getting yelled at for something i had no control over. here's the thing that really shocked me: he started yelling at me while his 12-14 year old son was right beside him, and the child didn't even look phased whatsoever, it's like this was a normal thing for him. i feel bad for the kid, because when he grows up there could be a possibility that he becomes just like his father and thinks that throwing a tantrum/yelling at people will get you what you want in life.

my manager did end up giving the guy the refund, because i was too heated up and also because i think that's what he wanted to hear all along, but just not from me. this entire situation could've been avoided if he had just mentioned that he saw the price to be 3.99 earlier, and i know for a fact that he did see the increased price on the price monitor that was right infront of him when he was paying.

it took me around an hour to fully calm down/stop shaking. it shocks me that there are people out there that think throwing a tantrum or looking down upon people who work in retail/the service industry can get them anything they want in life.

94,your rolls aren't dark enough!,"this is a super long post, but the tldr is at the bottom.

quick background: i work at a grocery store bakery where we bake bread, rolls, bagels, etc. we get them as frozen dough from a third party bakery but they're still pretty good when made. there is a certain amount of time that we have to bake each item to per store policy because they want all the products to look the same and not too burnt or undercooked at all. most customers don't say anything about this except this one lady. most of this story happened before i worked here, so a lot of it is second hand up until the last bit.

she comes in every week day around the same time, usually 3 or 4 pm and is always complaining about the same kind of roll, its a routine. our store has us bake about a few dozen rolls at a time for about 7 min in those hug industrial size ovens to get them at a nice golden color. this women thinks they're too ""light"" and aren't ""dark enough"". 

she started coming into our store a few years ago and the first few times my co-workers tried to tell her that they can't bake them any longer via store policy, but she wasn't having it. let me tell you this, this customer looks intimating to begin with since her face is set in a permanent scowl, but when she opened her mouth, she just said the nastiest and most condescending things to them when they were just trying to do their jobs and follow directions. i wasn't working there at the time, so this is all things that have just been told to me. 

the customer went to complain to a manager apparently and my co-workers were told to make just suck it up and deal with it. at first they would wait until the customer would come in, get yelled at for the rolls for not being dark enough and then throw one or two from the display in for her (this is a huge waste of space too - our ovens are usually supposed to bake several at a time). eventually they got tired of dealing with her on a daily basis and the managers kept saying, ""just make the customer happy"", so they came up with a solution.

every morning they would take a few rolls to the side and put them in for 10 min instead of 7. they were essentially burning the rolls, but this was the shade the customer liked them at. there were no more interactions with the customer for a little while so my co-workers thought it was pretty much over as long as they kept putting out the burnt rolls. 

one day though, the customer came around and complained that there weren't enough options for her and that they would need to make more. my co-workers looked at the display basket and there were still two burnt rolls for her to take plus a half dozen normal colored ones. confused they told her that there are plenty still and they usually don't make more until the basket is near empty. once again the customer spewed all her nastiness out on them for doing their job saying she ""needs options"" (meaning more burnt ones).

so now my co-workers and i (i started working here at this point) have to make at least six burnt rolls everyday for her and keep them in the back so other customers don't take them for this one lady who will only ever take at the very most two. just to make the customer happy and keep management off our backs. 

the only satisfaction that i get out of all this is that awe burn them for her and she seems to never notice.

tldr: nasty customer demands darker rolls from bakery. lots of jumping through hoops to avoid getting yelled at and ""keep the customer happy"" by just burning the rolls.",ConfettiMaster,tfr
95,that's the sound of the man working on the chain gang.,"when i was 16, i worked in a 'seed and feed' store, selling garden seed, fertilizer,  hay, straw, timothy (a sort of hay) and lots of other farm/garden things. 

the store owner had his own three ton flatbed ford (not red) he used to pick up bulk items. one day he sent the store assistant manager (am) to pick up a three ton load of dry slaked lime (used to 'sweeten' sour soil). 

it comes in 50 pound bags and is usually still quite warm from the roasting ovens at the limestone quarry. the truck came back with the load and the am backed it to the loading dock, parked it and told me to unload it into the storage area.

i think i weighed about 110 pounds at the time, so i knew i had some work ahead. i got the big 600lb rated two wheel hand truck from the back and rolled it to the dock and started shifting the load to the hand truck, one bag at a time. i stopped when i had 12 bags and then tried to get the truck to tilt over so i could roll it. it wouldn't move. think barney fife tugging and chinning him self on the handles. 

luck was with me, it didn't budge. eventually it dawned on me, it had 600 pounds on it. it that thing had tilted over it would have crushed me. 

so i unloaded six bags and tried again. success of a sort. it was still damned heavy but i got it to budge and moved it to the storage slot set for it. unloaded and went back.
after about 9 more repeats i was worn out. still had more than 10 repeats left.

the am came out to see how i was doing, then he told me to put some of bags back on the truck. i asked why and he pointed to the front of the ford. the front wheels were off the ground. 

when he had backed it up, he'd got the tail stuck under the dock bumper and as i reduced the load, the rear springs tried to raise the bed but couldn't so it pivoted on the rear axle and levered the front up. 

so rather than help me, i started shifting 50 pound bags onto the truck. eventually the bed dropped enough that he could pull the ford forward and unstick the bed. 

and you guessed it. i had to reshift the bags plus unload the rest of the three tons. all done, finally, and i got a breather. 

i sure earned my $0.75 an hour that day. ",RadioHacktive,tfr
96,lady comes in 15 mind before closing,"hello, ltl, ftp, mobile, td;lr etc. here goes, i work at an ""adult"" store. today was a pretty slow day, i was finished with cleaning the store by 11:30pm (we close at midnight) and all i had left to do was close the store and close and balance my drawer and backcash. 

i was in the back on my phone waiting for midnight to come when at 11:45, this lady rushes in. i tell her that we're closing in 15 mins and my computer will shut down after a point. she says she'll hurry. 

10 mins later i see her with atleast 8 pieces of dance wear and she keeps grabbing more. i remind her that i have to close my drawer soon. 

11:55, she walks up with 10 pieces and says she just needs to try them on, i tell her the dressing rooms are closed since i'm closing in 5 mins. she says that she'll try them on quickly and where can she do it, here ( as in the middle of the store where we have ceiling to floor windows facing a major hwy). i let her into a dressing room. 

she keeps trying to talk to me and get my opinion on everything, while i just keep reminding her that my computer is going to shut down soon. 

12:10, she finishes trying them on, leaves clothing all over the floor of the dressing room, ends up choosing two that she wants, then she wants to try on a wig, then she notices something on a mannequin that she wants to try, i tell her that i have to close my door so no. 

she keeps asking to try things on thanking me for how ""patient"" i was, while i keep telling her no. 

eventually she gets one outfit, a wig, and a vibrator. by the time she left it waz 12:20 and i'm suppose to be out by 12:30. i ended up not leaving until 1am plus i'm so frustrated that i had  trouble with my drawer.

the most annoying thing is near the end of her purchase, she says "" i'm not even working tonight, i'm going to meet my boyfriend, so i don't know why i'm here buying clothes, haha haha""

also she messed up my freshly mopped floors. 

tl;dr - lady came in 15 mins before closing, keep wanting to try things and didnt leave til 20 mins after closing

97,an awkward but memorable theft prevention,"this would be the first and last security stint i ever faced when i was working part time at a store that sells consumer electronics (will keep it anonymous thanks to a kind suggestion). my store manager came to me, and asked for a favour. he suspected a guy was avoiding communication with staff members, and noticed the guy had a backpack, and took a motherboard for a computer that he had his eye on for a while.

now, i had absolutely no training given on how to confront potential shop lifters, plus the item in question was not sold in my department, but the pc part department. in my head, i questioned why none of the lads at that department didn’t do their due diligence, but i agreed to help the store manager.

he noticed the guy go into our least used video section of the store, and headed towards the back. over there was a blind spot, no security cameras (at least not when i was there). my store manager stood outside, and nodded for me to “make my move”. again, no training was given to me, but i thought, “best way to catch a suspect in the act, video game logic: use stealth.”

so i quietly took the furthest aisle, and walked down. as i got closer to the back, i heard rustling noises, as if someone was trying to stuff a present in gift wrapping. to no one’s surprise, it was the guy my store manager pegged as a suspected shop lifter. he took the motherboard out of its box and was trying to fit it in his rucksack, which clearly was too small to hold it. even better for me, he was actually facing away from me, and wasn’t alert to my presence. stealth mission: success!!!

so many thoughts swirled in my head on how to handle the situation, but one thought prevailed and my body just rolled with it on auto pilot: i continue to sneak up behind the dude until i was a few feet away, clear my throat, and say, “can i help you, sir?”

this startled the dude, and he clearly knew he had been caught. so funnily enough he took my question literally, handed me the motherboard and box saying, “o-oh, no, that’s okay. here, have this back.”

after saying that, he proceeded to power walk in the opposite direction and try to head towards the main entrance. all the while, i head up the middle aisle where my store manager was in view, and showed him the motherboard and opened box. that was all he needed to see. my store manager ran after the would be thief. he didn’t catch him, but made sure the dude was aware he was banned from the store, and will be arrested on sight if spotted again (they had security images of him in the computer parts department).

i was given commendations and promoted to video games sales for my actions, but honestly, i still find the whole ordeal weird and funny to this day.

98,my coupon lady,"so, i work for a corporate grocery store. i’ve been “promoted” from bagger, to cashier, to self-checkout clerk (yes, that’s a thing), to the customer service desk, and am currently being trained to be a supervisor (they pay the same). but this story takes place on the second day i was at sco.

at this point, i had been left alone for a little bit while the person training me went on a break. i was still a little nervous as i had never been left alone here before, but what made it worse was the coupon lady. 

i had no idea who she was at this point, but she had brought two carts full of groceries to the self check out area. she got kinda mad because it kept asking her to put items back that she was taking off, and by them time she brought out her coupons, she was pretty ticked. i give her the normal “hi, how are you today” spiel, and proceed to scan the coupons.

i finish scanning the coupons, and as i’m walking away this conversation happened:

me: alright, have a good day ma’am!

cl: wait a minute, what about my coupons?

me: your coupons?

cl: i need them back. 

me: i’m sorry ma’am, but i’m not allowed to give back coupons after they’ve been scanned. it’s company policy.

cl: well, every time i’ve come in before i’ve always gotten them back.

me: i’m not sure why that is ma’am, but we’re not allowed to give them back.

i had to tell her this i think three times before she finally gave up and paid for her stuff and left. after she had left, however, one of the supervisors that was on the floor came up and told me to reprint the receipt and dig out the coupons she used. i got confused for a second, but did as i was told. 

come to find out that this lady comes in often and buys groceries with coupons that don’t even match the items. i helped look over the purchase and see that at least half of the items she bought didn’t match her coupons. 

the next time she came in, she had brought someone else with her, and they had their fair share of items as well. when the time came for their coupons to be scanned, i took her coupons and looked through all of them, double checking her items to see if they matched. this prompted this conversation. 

cl: what do you think you’re doing?

me: i’m checking your coupons to make sure they match your items. it’s a new policy (it wasn’t). 

cl: but you can’t do that! it’s an infringement on my privacy!

me: well i have to make sure ma’am. by the way, these coupons won’t work. they’re for the wrong size. 

after a bit of fussing, she took her coupons back and the transaction went smoothly. i did the same thing with the person that was with her, and they both left the store.

she came back a handful of times, each time with less and less coupons and items. this made me kinda happy, as well as the fact that every time she came in and i was there, she’d sigh and get real unhappy. you could tell at this point she didn’t like me.

one of the last times she’s come in and i was at sco, she called my supervisor after she left to complain about me. i don’t remember the whole conversation, as it was my supervisor who told me about it, but the gist was that i was “way too thorough and didn’t comply with her needs”, her needs being i don’t know. 

i wish i could say nothing really changed, but i can’t.

recently, she came in and bought only a small amount of groceries. she had around six coupons with her, and after she paid and stated walking out, i told her to have a nice day. she turned around very quickly and told me this:

cl: i don’t think i will, because every time i come here it’s always you i’m stuck with. and you are by far the worst employee on planet earth. you know why? because you are rude to me (not true), you discriminate against me (she is an older white female, and i’m white as well), and are against all of my coupons (that was the only part that is true). if i don’t see you again, it will be too soon!

i think she also said that she hated me somewhere in that yelling rant, but i can’t be sure. 

now, every time she comes in and i’m not at sco, i try to go to where she is just to tick her off. brightens up my day every time to see her flustered and upset. i’m pretty sure i’m going to hell for this. ",apenguinforhire,tfr
99,you will not speak about my employees like that!,"several years back i was working at a big chain grocery store. i had worked my way up from bagger, to cashier, to floor supervisor, then to the customer service desk. fun fact: they all paid the same. but anyway, we had a number of regulars. most of them were great, but there was one lady who came in 5-6 days a week and complained about something every single time. and when i say every time, i'm not exaggerating. policy was that whenever someone saw her walk in, we had to page the manager on duty and let them know so they could be prepared.  

when this story takes place, i had been working at my store for about 5 years and was working the service desk that day. she will be cl for crazy lady.  

&gt;cl: (approaching desk) call your manager. now.  

i recognized her and knew there was no point in asking if i could help. so i paged the manager who was already hanging around the area waiting for the call.  

&gt;manager: how can i help you ma'am?  
&gt;cl: your cashier on lane #10 has no idea what she is doing.  

cl then launched into a extremely nitpicky rant of all the ways that cashier #10 was bad at her job. my manager, who had already heard several similar rants from cl that same week, goes to his happy place. his glazed eyes must have told cl that he wasn't listing to her anymore. this infuriated cl more than ever and she stepped up the venom in her rant.  

&gt;cl: that dumb  [very mean words] should be fired. i hope she gets hit by a truck on the way home so i never have to deal with her again. she...  

this gets my managers attention. he's not in his happy place anymore and is now as angry as cl. he cuts her off mid sentence.  

&gt;manager: no! you will not talk about my employees like that. get out of my store. now!  

cl was completely shocked. as far as i know, nobody had ever stood up to her like that before. after a few seconds she walked out without another word. my manager seemed surprised too.  

&gt;manager: oh man. i'm going to get an earful about this from corporate. you heard all that. you can back me up on this, right? she was clearly going too far.  

i assured him that i would back him up, and he walked off still looking worried. corporate called back later that day to say that she had filed a complaint about both of us (what did i do?), and that they had given her a gift card for her trouble. nothing more ever came of it as far as i know and she continued coming in and complaining every day. but she never acted quite that crazy again.  

i never did figure out why she had so much pull with corporate, or why she scared the managers so much. they didn't act like that with anyone else. maybe she knew someone important? ",darth_ravage,tfr

103,(l) help a man suffering heatstroke supervisor said i should continue bagging!,"this happened about 3 years ago.


backstory: i worked in a grocery store in the southern usa, for those who haven’t lived there it can be really hot during the summer or in my state very humid. at the time i was a bagger/cashier/janitor so i wore many hats... the stories i could tell... 

onto the real story

that day we were starting to get closer to the lunch rush and as this store also had meals it was a popular destination. i’m baggin when a customer called to us and she asked us to help cause she noticed a man looking ready to faint sitting in the chair across from the pharmacy.

 i stopped everything i was doing and rushed over, he looked to be in his 60’s maybe 70’s so i didn’t take any chances i went and got him some water and talked to him while a manager was dialing 911. the reason he got heatstroke was by walking several miles without water in the summer heat!. (which was 90 degrees f while feeling like 100 f if i remember correctly)

 i told him my name after he told me his and even asked me to call someone, apparently he normally has a driver who he’d call but often joke about the ambulance so he wanted me to talk to her to ask her to pick him up and clarify it was a real emergency. 

since i got to know him at this point and knew that if i was in his situation i’d there was someone who i met and i’m scared i’d be grateful so i stayed with him till they took him away speaking calmly and trying my best to make him feel comfortable. 

the thing that was annoying was while in the middle of helping this man. one of my supervisors called for me to come over and help bagging when clearly this man needed someone by his side. and after the event he told me “you should have come over to continue bagging” now this guy already thought he was a know it all, so it was even more annoying.

i mean, dude! seriously!? bagging is such an easy task people can do for themselves that other countries only use cashiers! and even then i wasn’t going to leave a scared man like that!

luckily my actual store manager agreed with me and thanked me for staying by the mans side. and the man was calling to complement and tell them how grateful he was.

wholesome ending: apparently the man came back every night for a couple weeks to find me and thank me personally and told me my calm voice was soothing and helpful. 

glad i could be of help

104,a customer makes the easiest $600 of his life.,"tldr at the bottom

i worked at a major chain pharmacy. the store was located right next to a subway station. it was a friday around 5pm and i know we're gonna be busy with customers soon for the next few hours.

i was working the self-checkout/express checkout area. they're 5 machines for self checkout, all lined up against a wall next to each other, located right by the store's front door. when people pay at the machines i'm facing their back. (important later) my job is to stay near the machines and greet and help customers. if a customer has a problem at self-checkout; i assist them, which is me usually making sure they scan all their items properly. the machines refuse to scan any more items if its scale detects excess weight; so it thinks an item was placed on it when it wasn't scanned and accounted for. this happens a lot! usually because people put pressure on the scale while bagging items or ladies placing their purses on it.

the store gets busy fast. all machines are occupied and they're huge lines for self-checkout and towards the cashier. i'm helping anyone who has trouble scanning items right away so i can help kill this line. i'm doing well so far. now i'm just greeting customers and was watching the people's backs at the machines. one man quickly runs away from his machines to grab some gummy bears. which is fine, it wasn't far away and sometimes you forget items you need. he pays for them  and leaves his bags at the machines and runs away again to get more gummy bears. i'm annoyed and i roll my eyes because stunts  like this holds up the line. a couple other machines go off with customers needing my help. i help them but still notice this guy running back for more gummy bears! more customers walk in wanting to know an items location, more machines aren't scanning. i'm trying to help everyone as fast as i can and he's still getting more gummy bears, not leaving the machine. the fourth time is his final trip, he pays for his gummy bears and carries them away with his original groceries. i fake smile at him and say have a ""good night"" and he smiles back saying ""thanks."" i think nothing of it.

the next day my manager calls me in the office wanting to know about gummy bear guy. i told him he was just annoying me because he was holding up the line. my manager  then broke the news to me. he said the customer walked out the store with over $600! i was shocked and even more curious to how he did it!? he couldn't have gotten near the registers to get that money i said.  my manager laughed and said it happened right in front of me. he told me the new shift supervisor who fills the machines with cash for change accidentally put $20 bills into the slot that was suppose to give out $1 dollar bills. this guy was getting $20s instead of $1s. i couldn't see any of this because me facing their backs i explained. my manager laughed but annoyed said this was a learning experience.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: a customer realized we messed up by putting $20 bills inside the $1 bill slot at the self-checkout. he repeatedly made small purchases and walked away with over $600.",GregsTwitter,tfr
105,may i see your id,"based on the title, you would think this is an easy task. and well, youd be wrong. every single night i ask for id from people i'm unfamiliar with, and sometimes it's ok. 

last night it wasnt. i had 13 people come in and try to get swishers, or cigs or alcohol with no id. 

in my store you must have id if you are getting alcohol, no matter what. you could be family and i would have to id. now cigs, you have to look over 40. 

so in comes a young person

me: sure, i can grab you some swishers. may i see your id?
him: i dont have it. can i show you a photo of it?
me: sorry i have to physically inspect it and scan it. i'm sorry. 

he proceeds to flip me off and leave.

later a regular came in and she wanted alcohol.  this is a 50/50 with her. she either usually has it or dont. 

hi (her name), you getting beer tonight?
her: yes. but i dont have my id. how many times you gonna need it. you know me by f***ing name. 
me: i'm sorry. it's a no matter what rule. 
her: f*** you. 

and these are just from last night. i've been there 3 years. man.... i only wish i smoked or something to even need my id. at least the money paid to renew it would not be wasted, lol.

106,the time the computer system pulled a fast one on me.,"hello everyone. i got a quick story for you. this one takes place while i was a cashier at a large grocery store. this was during the pre-thanksgiving day rush and anyone who has worked at a grocery is probably aware that most stores are crazy busy during that time. (i once heard a manager say that she had walked over 20 miles in her first 3 hours during that rush). now for the story.

during the rush i was trying to ring up another large order, at least $200 worth of groceries, when i noticed my register screen had froze. i tap it a few times and press a few buttons to no avail. at the time our store was still using windows 95 for their registers and it happened all to often. i see the line continuing to grow and i flag my manager down and he quickly takes control of the situation. he sends the customer over to another register to finish the transaction and we reboot my register. i would have gone to another register to keep working but we literally had all the registers filled as we were so busy, we even had our portable register we use in the garden center out and it was also filled to capacity. 

my manager told me to stay put and get back to taking care of customers as soon as the register was working again. as one would expect from an old register and even older operating system it was taking its sweet time rebooting. almost 20 minutes had gone by and it was only halfway done. my manager comes by and asks what was taking me so long. i tell him the computer is still rebooting. my manager quickly looks at the computer and the second he does it froze up again! and, i kid you not, the same second the register froze a certain song came over the store radio, it was, you guessed it, ""never gonna give you up"" by rick astley. my manager and i look at each other in surprise and i ask ""did we really just get rickrolled by our computer system?"" my manger just says ""it would appear so"" before we both have a good laugh amidst the holiday chaos.",Goldstartankexpert,tfr
107,customer wants a refund for a bottle of wine,"so, i used to work in a convenience store before quitting two weeks ago. about two months ago, we had a customer who wanted a refund for a bottle of wine. the wine in question was called the fisherman and it’s the cheapest wine in my country. and, of course, it’s fucking disgusting. 

anyway, i’m stocking shelves and minding my own business when this guy starts talking to my boss. she wants to know what’s wrong, and the guy says something i’ll never forget. he said “i want my money back, this wine is absolutely disgusting. i haven’t experienced a tragedy of this magnitude since the damn war. “ i fucking lost it. 

my boss, who is the coldest woman i know, started laughing as well and told the man that we don’t ususally do this, but she’ll give him the money back. i may have hated the job, but at least the customers made it fun. sometimes. ",poursomedoconme666,tfr
108,i'll just take one of these then!,"okay, so i just made this account to follow and give some of my stories in this subreddit after reading some others, so here goes! (and sorry in advance if it's poorly formatted!)  


so for a bit of backstory, i'm from the uk and work in a shop that sells gaming products (consoles, headsets, games, phones, the works) and i've been there for years, i've seen it all, from having items thrown at me, to people trying to steal stacks of games. but this is the most recent and one of my favourite stories.  


it's a normal work day, a new game released, a few hours were spent pricing games and other stock, and there were three of us on shift, me \[me\], an assistant manager \[am\], and the store manager \[sm\]. toward the end of my shift, a woman we will call karen (not her real name, she never told me her name) walks into the store, and makes a beeline for the counter, carrying one of our bags. knowing this would be a return or a trade in of some description me and am got ready to deal with it, as they are the main source of customer grievances.  


&gt;**me**: hey there, what can i help you with today?  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: i bought this headset last week and it doesn't work, i want a new one.  
&gt;  
&gt;**me**: okay, let me take a look

she passes me the headset and tells me the microphone doesn't work, there's no damage to the headset, looks fine, but a bit grubby.

&gt;**me**: alright then, i'll give it a quick test, as we have to verify the fault to return it to the manufacturer, i'll just be a couple of minutes.

so to test the headsets we are taught to plug them into our demo xbox one, and test both the sound and microphone through cortana and game audio, i speak to cortana, and when she replies i turn the tv screen round to show karen it has worked, i repeat the test multiple times to show that it isn't a fluke, and is working as intended. we then plugged it into the demo ps4, and tested it on the mic testing area in settings, and the sound from the mic was coming through perfectly.

&gt;**karen**: so what's wrong with it then?  
&gt;  
&gt;**me**: as far as we can tell there is nothing at fault with this headset, and due to policy we cannot return the item, i can show you other headsets that you could take as an alternative?  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: no, the headset is faulty, my daughter told me that it stopped working, and i told her i would get it swapped for a different headset, so i want to return it!  
&gt;  
&gt;**me**: i'm sorry but there's not a lot i can do, our 1 month return policy doesn't apply as you have opened the product and haven't actually got the box with you, and we can't return it as faulty as there is no fault.

my assistant manager overhears and comes to help.

&gt;**am**: what's the problem here?  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: my headset is faulty and i want to return it but your staff refuses to return it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**am**: okay, darth\_saul95, could you find a fault with it?  
&gt;  
&gt;**me**: no, i tested in both consoles multiple times and it was fine.  
&gt;  
&gt;**am**: okay, well i'll give it another test just to go over it.

the am does the same tests again, shows her the same results i did, and removes the headset.

&gt;**am**: i'm sorry but i can't find a fault with this headset, and without a fault we can see in-  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: -the headset is faulty! it doesn't work for my daughter!  
&gt;  
&gt;**am**: have you tested the controller, or the console to make sure it is definitely the headset? lots of things go into making a headset work, and one piece being used incorrectly or being damaged would stop it working.  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: no, it's the headset, like i told you. i want to speak to your manager.  


am agrees and goes into the back to grab sm, who was in the middle of doing important work on the back office pc.

&gt;**sm**: hey there, i'm sm, how can i help?  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: i want to return this headset and your staff are refusing, and calling me a liar!

sm turns and tests the headset, yet again, bare in mind that this one set of headphones has now been tested by every member of staff, and has been shown to be working around 10 times across both consoles.

&gt;**sm**: i've done all the tests i can, and it is working perfectly fine, and is actually better than i expected as we've had more expensive pairs with worse quality. i can recommend you some different headsets if you'd like a different style, but that would be another purchase.  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: why won't you return my headset (she's getting very loud and going bright red at this point) my daughter said that this headset doesn't work, she doesn't lie, i know it doesn't work! if you won't return it, i will just take one of these instead!

she walks over to our headsets and picks up another of the same, while my manager is walking over to her, still holding her completely fine and working headset.

&gt;**sm**: no, you won't be taking one of those, that's called ""theft"", and if you try to steal from our store we will call security. (first warning)  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen**: call them! i'll tell them you refused to give me my money back, and wouldn't give me the headset back either!  
&gt;  
&gt;**karen** moves towards the door, but sm and am get between her and the exit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**sm**: look, you can't take our stock out of the store, or i will be forced to call security. (second warning)

she refuses, and yells ""don't touch me!"" sounding like a harpy, all the while am and sm (two very non-threatening guys) stand with their arms crossed, multiple feet back from her.

&gt;**sm**: we're not touching you, please just put the headphones back, and take yours back home.

sm calls security as she continues to screech and refuse to put them back. and within minutes, 5 security guards \[sg\] arrive, and start questioning the woman, am and sm, at the front of the store, all the while i'm serving the other, much less angry customers, though they're all distracted by the crazy lady shouting at the other side of the store.

she rolls of some story about how we had taken her headset from her after claiming it was working and wasn't faulty ""even though it was"", we laid hands on her, and we wouldn't let her get a replacement one. we know all the security by name, and have done midnight openings with a fair few of them when big games like cod and gta had been released, so they know that we wouldn't be shady like that, but they humour her, ask for our side of the story, and offer to check the cctv footage. karen. goes. white. she hadn't seen the cameras around the store, one facing toward the till she had been stood at, and one directly above her, and one at the front of the store. her accusations of her being manhandled would be proven false, and her story would have unraveled. she was brought to the tills, where the security guard (who is an avid gamer) offered to test it for her to be sure. she hesitated, said ""it's not worth it"", then stormed out of the store. knocking over some stock as she goes. the security guard turns to me and says ""you okay?"" i laughed, after a dull, quiet day, we finally had something interesting happen.

&gt;**me**: hey sg, i'm fine, sorry we had to call you over, are we seeing you in for the new release later?  
&gt;  
&gt;**sg**: i'm not sure, i'll check some reviews first. oh, by the way, if you'd have let her walk out of the store, she'd technically have stolen it, and she'd be speaking to some lovely officers right now. just so you know!

so, in the end, she got laughed at by a store full of customers, wasted half an hour of her day, and money on fuel, and left with just her ""faulty"" headset. i wish more had happened, as, someone who is so willing to steal just because they don't get their own way, and steal so blatantly that you actually advertise to the staff that you're going to steal something doesn't deserve to get off with no punishment.

so i work in a pretty popular retail chain as a stocker/unloader. and as a side note, i was also 7 months pregnant at the time so i was showing pretty obviously. one day as i’m putting paper products away, a little boy starts climbing on the bins we display paper towels in. worried he might hurt himself, i walk over to talk to his mother who is nearby on the phone, not paying attention to her son. i try to get her attention but it’s just not happening. so i walk over to the boy and say “please don’t climb in the bins, you could get hurt.” and then walk back over to my stocking cart. a few minutes later, the mother and son leave, mom still chatting away on the phone. as i’m halfway through helping another customer find something, the mother storms up to me and says “excuse me, who do you think you are telling my son what to do? he wasn’t doing anything wrong and now you’ve upset him. look at him, he’s crying!” (he was not crying) so i calmly tell her i tried to get her attention but she was too busy on the phone so i just asked him nicely to stop. she did not like that. she says “don’t go near my son. he wasn’t doing anything wrong. you’re an awful employee. *gestures to my stomach* and you’re going to be an awful mother too!” and then stormed off. 

honestly, as soon as she was gone, i had to hightail it to the back room before i started crying because i don’t handle getting yelled at very well and it was even worse with the pregnancy hormones. i ended up clocking out early and going home to take a nap to relieve some stress. ",DemonicRix,tfr

&amp;#x200b;

so about 5 years back, i used to work at for a big name retail store. i started in the back, but was moved to the electronics section. i used to work nights in the back, so when i moved, i started working the closing shifts in electronics, which i would regularly close by myself from like 5:00-10:00 (smaller store, so wasn't open as long as some of the major stores. i'm also canadian) the managers who were at the store were pretty cool guys as well. 

&amp;#x200b;

so on one particularly slow evening, i'm walking around electronics, no one around, and was chatting with one of the managers on duty. just casual chat. and a group of 3 people walk in and need help looking for a specific cable. so i help them find it and then they walk away from the electronics. (manager is still in the department to help keep an eye on things) so i'm going around, making sure everything is looking neat, when one of the guys comes back quite quickly. so thinking they have the wrong thing, i walk over to him to see if everything is ok. c = customer, m = manager, me = the wonderful person at the keyboard.

me: ""is everything alright? anything else i can help you with?"" 

c: ""i don't like being watched while i'm shopping.""

now i'm a little taken back by this, as i was just wanting to help out again, not stalking the guy at all, and the other two people sauntered back into the electronics as well. the manager had heard what was happening at the same time and he walked over to the guy. 

m: ""seriously, look around you"" he said pointing to about 4 cameras in the area. ""there are cameras watching what you do everywhere"" 

and so c starts arguing with the manager about things. one of c's friends tries to de-escalate the situation by saying things like ""come on guys, lets just go"" but c just kept on going with m and eventually m lead c to the front. the 3rd friend that was there looked embarrassed by the whole situation and looked like they wanted to leave asap. so the second friend grabs the thing they need and go to pay for it. as i heard later from m, the second friend had quite a few choice words for m, and the local authorities had to be called to take care of the situation. m comes up to me afterwards and makes sure i'm doing alright to which i tell him yeah, doing fine (having been a hockey ref for a while helped me learn how to deal with rowdy people). m suspected that c was probably gonna try and sneak something and bolt from his behaviour. so awesome m was around to help out with things. but it was one of the most bizzare interactions i had while working the job. i still go down and check to see who still works there and chat with them a bit to catch up.

i work in an eletronics department of a big box retailer. now we aren't the biggest store so other stores normally  will get a high demand product before us instead, unless we order a lot of it before that happens. one of such items is a pre-paid card for home phone service. 

we had ordered hundreds of them just incase of a shortage and we got lucky because soon after it was out of stock everywhere. naturally people came here instead of other stores. que old lady (ol).

i was cleaning when i hear someone screaming  they need help. i signed walking over annoyed someone is screaming like a banshee instead of coming to me ask for help.

me: ""hi! how ca- "" she cuts me off
ol: ""you never have anything instock this store is terrible!""
me: slightly annoyed, but shrug it off ""what's the item you are looking for?""

names off pre paid card

me: ""oh we have those right over here!""
i take her over to place i was cleaning and the card were there.
she grumbles about the layout, and not being able to find anything. so i chucked it up to her being rude as a side effect of a remodeling the store, and just mad at being confused. it's a common thing, figuring it was over. but boy was i wrong.

ol: ""this store is terrible, never has what i need in stock""

me: confused ""ma'am we have the item?""

ol: ""i know there are good people  here and i'd hate to see people not be working"" blah blah

me: ""some people  like coming here so that wouldn't  be good""
 
she laughed at me, and called me a liar. saying  the store at the snooty town 20 mins from here  was better. i knew the problem now. she wasn't mad at items being out of stock here. she's mad she had to go out of here way to a back woods to get her stuff.

me: ""ma'am i have plenty of regulars who come here cause they like me and my department and-"" 
cut off again, called a liar and that no one wants to be here.

nd is my regular and loves me to death. he's a bit older and has a mental disability but i love him just the same.
he interjects

nd: ""op, op there's my guy!"" he bear hugs me. ""hey thanks for helping me with my application the other day, and i finally learned how to use google like you showed me.""
i told him that's great and politely let him know i was with someone.

nd: ""oh i'm sorry bud, sorry ma'am. listen to this guy he way nicer than the folks at other stores""
 if looks could kill, the ol look furious. i was afraid she was going to go off so i stepped in between them.

ol: ""oh i'm done. let your favorite help you.""
she walked away, so relieved helped my regular add a phone card to his phone and thought it was over.

nope next day got called into the office.
turns out she filed a complaint saying i was rude, and refused to help and belittled and embarrassed her with a customer.

first off, i work in a mall at a store that sells a lot of pop culture things (it's not really hard to figure out but still). i was working by myself for closing, and while it was expected to be a very laidback evening, it got fairly busy at one point. while helping a customer check out, i saw a woman standing in front of our store (near the seats in the mall) using her phone. she had a small child with her who saw something in our window that caught her eye. she repeatedly tried to get her mother's attention but to no avail. so, she walked into the shop and heads right to what she wanted, a backpack that looks like an owl.

mind you, this child is without supervision and walks into the store by herself. she grabs the backpack and starts to walk out with it. the backpack, like everything we have in our store, has a sensor and the door's alarm goes off. everyone in the store turns to see this little girl walk with this backpack out to her mother. as soon as the mother sees all of this, she hangs up her phone and guides her daughter back in to return the item. she apologizes as they both leave, with the daughter looking very confused as to what was going on.

all of us in the store had a good laugh about it.

edit: after reading all of your comments, y’all a bunch of kleptos and i love each and every single one of you. stay gold.

116,entitled old bat wants ribs we don't have,"hello everybody! this will be my first post ever on reddit, so please enjoy.

so a little bit of background; i was diagnosed with a severe form of anxiety disorder when i was 10. a lot of things can trigger an anxiety attack, particularly someone yelling at me without warning. i've managed to get a bit of control over my anxiety over the years with meds, but i still have attacks from time to time. now on to the story.

i work at a small mom and pop grocery store in my home town, one of the very few in my area (there are a lot of small towns around us, but this is pretty much the only store). i was working along side my other co worker, which we'll call ap (amazing person). we were the only employees there because the store is understaffed. ap was running the cash register while i was taking care of small tasks i do every day (take out trash, sweep, ect.) i had just started to bring out a cart i stacked with crates of milk to restock the cooler when i ran into eob (entitled old bat).

she was short and fat, like a human beach ball, with thinning white hair, and what seemed to be a permanent scowl. eob seemed nice at first, all she was there for was a large rack of ribs that had been advertised as 'on sale' in that week's ad. i go to the meat cooler to help her look and see nothing, not even a spot where they could have been. this isn't the first time something like this had happened. sometimes our store managers forget to take out something from the ad that we don't carry, but a sister location in another state does.

i try to explain to the eob that we might not carry what she is looking for, but she doesn't want to hear it. her sweet attitude dropped to reveal her true nature, and it's not a pretty one. ""well just go get another employee."" she huffed, clearly annoyed with me. i go to do that, not wanting her to be upset, but i turn around just to make sure i didn't miss it or something (it happens a lot). but as soon as a start to look again, eob starts to yell right in my ear. ""just go get someone already! i came all the way from (insert town here) just for this and i don't want it to be a waste of my precious time!"" i backed away quickly with a quiet ""yes ma'am."" before walking away. at this point i'm shaking, trying to keep it together. i had about an hour left of my shift and i didn't want to spend it bawling in front of the entire store (again).

i make my way upfront to ap, who is checking out a line of about three people. i tap her shoulder and explain what was going on. she could see i was shaken and trying to keep it together so she went to deal with eob while i took her place. apparently, everyone in line could hear eob's yelling and helped me calm down, telling me it was alright and they're own experiences with people like that. these people were regulars, so they knew about my disorder. by the time ap was back upfront, i was laughing with the customers and back to my normal self. ap on the other hand, looked ticked, and it takes a lot to make ap ticked. as soon as the line was empty, she explained that we did not have the ribs eob was looking for, and this wasn't the first time she caused issues. this lady usually came in looking for discounts, complaining about customer service, and lack of items we didn't have that she wanted. hardly anyone liked her, and ap even told me eob would even go to funerals of people she didn't know just to get a free meal! talk about cheep and messed up. 

after a bit, eob finally gets up to the register with only a bag of plain potato chips. she pays for them and leaves with a huff, not saying a single word to ap or i. ap and i were relieved, we didn't want to deal with anymore drama that day.

117,i know you don't haggle...,"now that the snow storm that ravaged the entire freaking united states is over, beautiful weather has returned. so, of course, that means my thrift store does some shifting of stock. stuff that has been held for nicer weather is now going out. one of those things is a picnic basket for two, which gets displayed behind the counter.

a wild customer appears!

&gt;customer: ""wow i really like that basket... but not for $15.""  
&gt;  
&gt;me: ""sorry sir, the price is as marked. the housewares department determined they're going for that price when used. we cannot haggle.""  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: ""hmm. you know, i bought a new one for $20, retail price.""  
&gt;  
&gt;me: ""uh huh...""  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: ""...wow... ... ... i really do like that. it's really cool. but not for $15.... maybe 10. but not 15....""

he pauses, staring expectantly at me.

&gt;me: ""...sorry sir, we still don't haggle here.""

he fiddles with it, almost obsessively, checking that the zippers work for all compartments, that he really is getting two of every utensil, yadda yadda.

&gt;customer: ""well, i really like it, but not for $15...""

he glances expectantly at me again.

&gt;me: ""...""  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: ""siiiiiiiiigggggggghhhhhh. well, i guess i'll have to think about it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;me: \*puts it back behind the counter, then in a falsely chipper voice; ""thank you sir! if you decided to actually pay the asking price, you just ask us to bring it out for you.""  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: ""well, i really do like it. just not for that price.""  
&gt;  
&gt;me: ""have a good day! bye bye now!""  
&gt;  
&gt;me: \*muttering\* ""you don't actually like it, you just want it cheaper, you cheapskate...""

the guy came in the next afternoon, hoping to pine over the item and give me a chance to break store policy to accommodate his wishes for a lower price. 

it was with great pleasure that i told him a young man bought it for our asking price, hoping to give his date a lovely spring lunch as soon as the mud dries up a little.

free advice: if they don't haggle, and you really want it, get it. if all you want is a discount and to re-sell it for profit, pay the asking price, because trying to hold out for a better deal means someone else may just snatch it up for the asking price without trying to haggle.

118,wood magnets,"once upon a time, i ran the hardware department at (national big-box home improvement store).  one day a man walks up to me.

me:  what are you working on today? 

guy:  i'm looking for wood magnets.

(my mind doesn't register ""wood"")

me:  well, i've got some magnets here, and more over here.  what are you trying to do with them?

guy:  do any of these work with wood?

me:  sure, these and these and those have adhesive backing.  you peel it off and stick them to whatever you want.

guy:  no i mean like, i want magnets for wood.  i want to stick two pieces of wood together and take them apart whenever i want.

me:  no.  we don't have that.

guy:  why not?

me:  that's not a thing.

guy:  why not?

me:  because of science.  do you really want me to explain why wood isn't magnetic?  because i can if that's what you are asking, but yeah ... wood isn't magnetic.  

guy busts out the classic:  well do you think (other chain) has them?

me:  no.  because they aren't real.  that's not a thing.

guy (golden classic):  i'm going to (other chain)

me (standard response):  ok, but when you get there, demand to speak to the manager.  i know him personally and he is the only person in that store who knows anything.  if he tells you he doesn't know where they are, he's lying.

119,that's because you did literally the opposite of what i told you to do...,"a gentleman came to me and informed me that he wanted to use last month's fuel points, but the fuel pump was only letting him use this month's. i told him that's how they work, if he wanted to use last month's points i could do it for him at the register. (idk if everywhere else with fuel points works the same way, but if you don't use yours for the month here then they get ""stored"" and you can still use them into the next month, but we have to manually adjust them at the register) 

me: no problem! if you would, just go back and hang your pump up for me then come back here to the register. that'll cancel it at the pump and i can do it for you manually. 

man: alright. 

he walks off and a few minutes later he comes back with his debit and rewards card. 

man: okay, do i just give you these? 

me: yep! how much did you want to put on the pump?

man: well i just filled it, you told me to pump it. 

me: oh...no, i said hang the pump up. let me check your points real quick... 

i checked his account and they're all still there, so he must have at least hit the use no points button. that saved me a lot of trouble. 

me: okay, so your points are still there, but because you've already pumped i can't do anything except send you to customer service and they can manually deduct your points and give you the cash difference if you'd like. 

man: /screaming and pointing at me/ right here?

me: no, customer service, the desk inside the grocery store. they'll deduct last month's points that you wanted to use and give you cash for them. 

man: this is the second time i've lost points because you people don't know how to instruct your customers. 

me: like i said, all your points are still there and i did tell you how to avoid this, sir. 

man: you never told me to come back here first, you said to pump my gas. thanks for letting me waste 70 cents a gallon. 

me: no, i told you to hang your pump up and come back to the register. and i've already told you numerous times that your points are still there. 

man: they are?

me: yes, i literally circled it on your receipt when i handed it to you and i've been trying to explain to you that they're still there and how to get your discount but you just wanted to scream at me. 

man: okay. /walks off into the sunset 

don't know if he went to cs yet. i hope he does, i'm curious to see what his story is. usually i'm a lot more patient and less defensive with customers, but i already had a woman tell me her pump was ""on the other side of whatever"" and got an attitude with me because i didn't know where that was, so my patience is running very thin today because i've only been here an hour.

120,“you can sew can’t you??”,"all the pre-post warnings: first post + on mobile !

i work at a decently sized children’s store where you pay us to stuff an animal for you. it’s honestly a super fun job, and i love the kids, but the parents, man. the parents.

i got hired in december, and if any of you have worked in a mall or a children’s store during december—you know. it’s crazy all month. our busiest day of the year is the saturday before christmas, and mind you, i’ve only been working there for maybe 3 weeks now.

i’m at the front greeting customers and doing my little script of, “hi! how are you? what brings you in today? is there anything specific you’re looking for?” to everyone.

a woman was looking through all the bins and had grabbed some bear and walked up to me. i thought she was going to ask me what to do next, as some people are unfamiliar with the process, or ask if she can buy it unstuffed. you know, normal questions. so i say, “did you find one you like?” 

she responds, “not really. do you have this one in blue?”

we did not. i knew, however, that we did online and i informed her of such. even added on that we can ship it to her for free and either stuffed or unstuffed—her choice!

this was not the answer she was looking for. “can you look in the back for me?”

i knew we didn’t have it in the back, and even though our back room is like a stock room we don’t have everything. but i thought i’d just “check” anyway. we did have it in blue earlier in the week, i knew we’d sold out, but whatever. i’d look.

surprise, we didn’t have it. i came out and told her so. she’s frustrated now, but i’m expecting her to just choose a different one and move on. 

nope.

“okay, well then make one for me!” she demands.

“what?” i ask, confused, because seriously, what??

“this is [name of store] isn’t it?? so make me one!”

she literally thought we made the animals, in the backroom. like we had fabric that we cut and sewed together and made the skins for the animals. i try to explain to her that, no, that’s not how it works. we get sent the animal “skins” premade.

“you know how to sew don’t you??? i’ve seen employees hand sewing them so go make me one! i need it for christmas.”

again, i try to explain to her that that isn’t how it works but, alas, she’s determined. finally, “i wanna speak to your manager!”

gladly, lady. i got my manager and she told her the exact same thing but that we had it online and the lady stormed out of the store.

tldr; lady gets mad that we don’t literally make the stuffed animals and she can’t have one we didn’t stock.",xbandable,tfr
121,customer tried to report me for no reason.,"i was reminded about this story during a conversation i had today, so i thought i'd share it.

&amp;#x200b;

again, for context, i work at a fabric and crafts store. not only do i work the front registers, but i'm also work in the craft department (or not really anymore? that's another story). 

about mid way last year, for the first time since i started working about 4 years ago, we reworked the whole of craft. we pretty much moved everything where it was to another part of the department, so regulars and other customers (and not to forget most of the staff) who had visited the store before were a little confused where everything was- and rightfully so, because so were we. 

for the sake of the story, i'm going to need to address that we stock a particular paper craft machine that can only be brought in my country from our franchise (unless you order from an online store). all the accessories for this machine used to be at the front of the department before the move. issue was that we were getting more stock in than we could display, so all the products were moved into one of the longer aisles during the rework to allow for more room (thankfully). in it's place were going to be our artist paints and calligraphy section. 

this is where our story begins. 

&amp;#x200b;

on a weekend morning, my manager and i are stacking the now empty shelves at the front of the department, exactly where the machine and accessories used to be. whenever we're asked a question my manager tends to take the reins. she has this unspoken rule where anyone who is working with her isn't allowed to talk to a customer for more than a minute so that we're able to get everything done that she wants us to do (and that is also another story for another day). 

we hadn't had many questions up to this point, and i've had to escort one or two customers across the department to find something, but other than that, we haven't had much trouble at all. 

about 45 minutes into stacking these shelves, a couple approaches us. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;lady: where did all the (paper craft machine) things go?  
&gt;  
&gt;me: it's just down here, ma'am.

&amp;#x200b;

i stand up from my position and walk into the main run-way to point out the aisle- and by this i mean i walk up to the aisle and indicate where it is as they watch from where they were standing, before returning. it's clearly visible with a large sign displaying the paper craft machine's name and has an obnoxious green colour plastered everywhere.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;lady: but... why did you move it?

&amp;#x200b;

she had a disgusted and frustrated tone in her voice. i was completely taken aback and confused about why she had gone from 0-100. before i could respond, my manager stood in.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;manager: we have more stock coming in so we've had to allocate a larger aisle to it.   
&gt;  
&gt;man: but that's just confusing!

&amp;#x200b;

at this point the man angrily walked off. the woman followed suit, but muttered some kind of curse at me. something along the lines of ""fucking unhelpful bitch"" or ""what a fucking joke""- it was hard to understand but i knew she had said something of the kind. 

&amp;#x200b;

about an hour had rolled by after the altercation. i'd had no trouble with any other customers, and neither had my manager. we had moved to another shelf at the front of the department- canvas'. this aisle was inline with the pathway up to layby, which is where our store manager is most of the time. we're able to see every customer who lines up or any staff member who exits or enters. we aren't however, able to hear what is being said. 

all of a sudden i can hear hissing and complaining coming from the layby counter. i look over and wouldn't you know it- the couple was standing there, grilling the poor lady serving there (i should mention is was mostly the woman doing the talking). although i couldn't understand what was being said, it was obvious that she was upset, angry and very frustrated about something. i assumed that perhaps we didn't have a product she was looking for and the layby server had dealt the bad news. that papercraft machine and it's accessories were and are still quite popular, and at the time we had been running low on stock of some of the more popular products from the range.

after a minute or two the layby lady ducked into the office, and out came the store manager. again, at this point i honestly thought it was a customer going over the top and complaining about not having something in stock- because obviously we need to read everyone's minds and have exactly what they want in stock, whenever they want it. however, it was only when i noticed out of the corner of my eye that the couple were pointing at me in the aisle did i know something was wrong. i instinctively looked to my manager, who seemed to have had the same thought. she prompted me to continue stacking, so i did. 

&amp;#x200b;

a couple more hours pass by, the couple had left, and i had moved on to putting out more stock in our wool section of the department. my manager out of the blue approached me and ushered me to the corner of the wool section- pretty much the back corner of the store. 

she said that she had been called into the back office and practically roasted and interrogated. it turns out that the couple we had, had an issue with earlier complained to the store manager and it wasn't about low stock as i had previously thought. they accused my manager, and myself, of not doing our jobs properly. not only did they insist that neither of us had shown them to the paper craft machine aisle, but an hour after the altercation, they had accused us of sending them to the layby counter to find out where the aisle was because apparently we 'didn't work in the department'. 

i was dumbfounded. what had i done to make them try to report my manager and me for doing nothing wrong? the only thing i can think of is that they were highly inconvenienced that the products had been moved *two aisles* down. i'd love to know if any of you have had similar experiences because this was just ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200b;

edit: for clarification, the customers had said that my manager and myself were very rude and didn't try to help them find the aisle they were looking for (as i stated earlier i did, indeed, show them where the aisle was). they accused us of sending them to layby to ask where they would find the product, as well as claiming that i specifically had said that ""we don't work in this department"".

122,you have how many items?,"so first time poster, here.


i work for a grocery store in the northeast this one particular day i'm told that after my break i'm going to be taking over on the self checkouts. (no big deal, i'm more used to the standard registers but by this point have been on the self checkouts a handful of times).


well our store is set up so we have 4 self checkouts stations, (each with a 15 item limit) 2 express lanes (20 items or less) and the rest are standard registers.


all is going smoothly at first only issue is that station 1 is down for maintenance. i'm helping another customer key in some produce do i didn't notice them come up. i look back after keying in the produce and this customer had an entire large cart full of things, plus a kiddie cart. normally when it's slow i don't push the limit issue if it's over a little but when all was said and done she had over 136 items.

123,stories from loading mulch,"so this will be a couple  of ""short"" stories from my time working at a home improvement store from about a year ago. as some who read my previous story know, this store continually understaffed the outdoor garden section, so they had to pull people from other sections. 

now, as a 20ish year old male, i was the first choice of the managers and i liked to help out, especially to get out of my section. but i'm not that strong and these bags of mulch are large and heavy.

the way that loading mulch worked at my store was that a customer would go up to the cashier and say, for example:

""i'd like to get 20 bags of brown mulch.""

the cashier would ring the customer up for the 20 bags and ask them to drive around to the side of the store, where the mulch was stacked on pallets, where a loader or associate would then load the bags into the customer's car after marking the receipt.

now for some weather clarification. this was late spring/early summer on the east coast of the us, so it got pretty damn hot. there was no shade unless i sat down behind a tall pallet so i just got used to keeping a bottle of sunscreen in my work locker.

as for customers, there would be the ones that would sit in their car and barely say a word to you when you asked them for their receipt. and then there would be the ones that would help you load their car. i even had a group of contractors help me out on an especially busy day for about fifteen minutes (it helped a lot).

but there were some notable customers, and not for a good reason.

**first story:** one hot day, i'm out with the loader when a pickup truck pulls up. the loader, phil (not real name) asks the driver for his receipt and this dude wants 50 bags. normally, when someone wants 50 bags, we pull out a pallet, take a few bags off the top, and then put the whole pallet onto the truck with the forklift. (we don't even charge for the pallet)

nope, this dude wants us to load them all by hand. so i get on the back of the truck and phil hands them to me while i organize them on the back of the truck (or they would fall out or break once the truck moved).

this dude stands outside his truck and glares at us while we sweat, impatiently tapping his foot. when we finish (going pretty fast because there are other cars waiting), i jump off the truck, the customer slams the tailgate closed, gets in his truck, revs his engine a couple of times (like he's trying to push his exhaust in our faces), and then speeds off. phil and i just shrug and go back to work.

**second story:** another day, it was 95 out side (fahrenheit) on the busiest mulch weekend of the year. phil and i are breaking our backs outside (keep in mind, this isn't even my assigned job), with little to no water. saturday night (after 9 hours) i get home and am just exhausted.

sunday i go into work. still hot, still busy. i notice immediately that phil isn't at work. i assume he's coming in later so i keep working. nope, he quit. that morning. just quit. so it's just skinny me out there. the line backs up enough that the store manager has to come out and help me while they call in some employees on their day off. (i didn't get into trouble for this, the manager was a cool dude and knew i was working as fast as i could go.)

**final story:** i'm loading mulch into cars, regular day. then this woman pulls up in a sedan and asks for 30 bags of mulch. 

**me:** ma'am, i highly doubt fifteen bags will fit, let alone thirty.

**lady:** well, i paid for thirty!

**me:** alright, will do! (rolling my eyes internally)

i stuff fourteen bags into the trunk and backseat of her car. (she didn't want mulch in her front seat, could've put three bags in there. don't know how she was planning to see out the back of her car.)

by this point she's huffing and rolling her eyes as thirty are clearly not going to fit.

**me:** ma'am, i can take the fourteen off the receipt and you can come back for the remainder later today. (it was early afternoon. and we split orders before with no issue.)

**lady:** no, i want a refund for the bags that won't fit.

**me:** then we'll have to go inside to the customer service desk.

**lady:** what? can't the cashiers do it?

**me:** only the customer service associates have the permissions to do refunds (plus all three registers had long lines).

**lady:** fine.

i have the lady park her car in the lot and then walk her inside. she's snapping at me, saying ""why is it so far?"" and ""this is absurd!""

first, it wasn't all that far. second, as i told her, i don't make the rules. third, maybe you should have thought about it before getting thirty bags!

the customer service associate looks at us like we're crazy, asking for a refund, but i raise an eyebrow and he gets the message. she gets her money and leaves with a huff. 

**closer:** i probably spent more time outside than in my assigned department. the strain on my muscles was eventually too much and i tore a ligament in my left arm while loading mulch. couldn't clench my fist all the way for a month because of nerve damage, had to go to therapy, was out for four weeks and then let go soon after (they told me on my last day that it was my last day)

now don't get me wrong, i still know many people there by name and my section manager (awesome man) went out of his way to give me tasks i could do with one hand ( my left arm was in a sling). i always enjoy stopping in and chatting with them. it was a learning experience for sure but i don't plan to go back anytime soon.",ColBlackhawk,tfr
124,the time a guy stole from one store...only to sell it back to another store 20 minutes away,"so this all happened today, so i’ll try to recap everything that happened.

so around 3, this guy walks in looking to buy a ps4. i give him the used price and tell him he can make his own bundle with a deal we have going on right now. now what i can assume to be his friend comes in and starts looking for a phone he says he dropped earlier, and my associate and i have never seen him before. he looks around a bit, and ends up leaving. all the while, the first guy is making fun of him for losing his phone when he never came into the store in the first place. this guy now asks to get 2k and ufc, and after talking with him a little more, i excuse myself to go grab his console. i come back out, and he sees it’s not in the typical playstation box. he asks how much it would be for a new one and i tell him there’s a difference of about $70 if he were to buy the new one. he asks to take a look at the console since it’s used, which i’m fine with opening to give him a look at it. i set it down on the counter, place my arm on it, and as i am about to open it with razor in hand, the guy wrestles it away from me and takes off. as he runs, i grab the store phone and dial 911 as i try to see where he went.

i talk to the operator, give a description of the perp, and the police show up after i write an email to my district leader and the loss prevention manager. i’ve got everything queued up for them to take pictures of and get them on their way, but the manager of the phone store next door comes in and gives his statement. apparently the guy was in his store before asking about phones, but didn’t have an id, so he left. after he ran out of our store carrying that blue box, he apparently hid in a bush until a car came to swoop him up and they were gone just like that. i gave the police the serial number of the system, talk to one of the cops about playing siege on ps4 (bless that man), and get them on their merry way.

not 30 minutes after, i get a call from my district manager asking if i have the serial number of the ps4 because a customer matching the description was trading in a ps4 at a store about 20 minutes away. i give him the number and await a response.

2 hours later, guess what? it was the same dude. gave his id and everything to trade in the system. turns out he already has warrants out for his arrest for felony theft.

and that’s how i spent my day, how was yours?",EVL21,tfr
125,that time i mobilized a nationwide corporate chain to make my sales....,"so i thought i'd share this, was maybe 10 years ago now? but i'm sure i'm still discussed to this day at this company thank to this.... this is a tale of auto parts and desperation. 

i took a job as wholesale manager at a very prominent location at a national auto parts/tire/repair chain. more than 200 repair shops/dealerships within delivery range of my store. big problem, one of their largest competitors has a superhub location a stones throw away and has everything ever made in stock and loads of drivers to send it right out. they also were usually the cheapest available, so i only was able to field calls for higher quality oe grade parts and the sales numbers were garbage. but how to compete? 

i tried making more outside sales calls, priced aggressively, kept delivery timely, no luck, still couldn't compete. what to do?

so the one area i was successful in, was tires. their pricing was decent, and the brands were as well, and i got to know the owners of several tire chains in the same area.

well, one day i get a call from a guy wanting a particular tire, because he has a set of 3 and needs just 1 to make the set. i find the part number and plug it in and my computer spits me out a list of store that still have it, closest one is more than a state away, not worth it. but i see something interesting, there is a note on the part number that was it's part of the ""master discontinuation list"". what, i wonder, is that?

so i start digging into the corporate network to find this list, and i find it. it has every part number of every discontinued tire the chain still has in stock and how many. ranging from thousands to one left nation wide. i also note that every part number i plug in comes up ""clearance"". hmmm....

so the problem is this. the number in stock is spread out to store all across the us. the hubs don't have any more, just individual stores with odd sets. i have to call every store, and get them to store to store them to me, can't do it. 

so the same day i get a call from one of the owners of a large tire chain in the area, and i bring it up to him. i ask for his most popular sizes and brands he prefers and i started my way through ""the list"". 

i find dozens of part numbers that fit his criteria, but how can i get them? so a few days later, the regional wholesale manager comes in and i ask him a few questions. number one, how much can i sell these for, and is there a limit on store to store transfers? his answers, as low as the system will allow you is okay, and no limit, just how much time i want to spend.

so i start digging in the corporate directory, call the head of the local distribution center, and find out who is in charge of shipping. i get him on the phone and ask my question.

""if i give you a part number, can you issue a recall on it and have them shipped to my store?""

""what? uh, i guess i can do that? nothing prevents it, just give me a list of numbers.""

and oh boy did i. 

thousands of tires began tricking from the stores into the local distribution centers and then the massive snowballing chain began it westward journey to california.

i sold hundreds of thousands of dollar of tires to this guy. i had the poor delivery drivers packing their ford rangers full of nothing but tires and going in/out round-the-clock for weeks. 

but alas, all good things must come to an end. someone word got back to those-on-high that the west coast had lost it's mind. a few days later, a few executives show up at the store demanding to know what the hell is going on.

i was more than ready to back myself up with references from the regional manager and the shipping manager. they were furious. whole trailers were slotted to no one but our store, it backed up delivery across the nation. but i had an iron shield to protect me. i asked, and i was told that i could. so i did. they sputtered for a while and told me to never do it again.

the store saw the most record sales numbers in history, the general manager and the store manager took me out for ribs afterwards.",crispysilicon,tfr
126,disabled woman has the most beautiful name.,"very short story. i work in hardware retail as a cashire and i had a very elderly, very special needs, very physically disabled woman come up to my counter with her nurse to buy some locks (i dont mean to offend anyone). her nurse kept calling the elderly woman ""bon"". they paid in check so i had to check the elderly womans id and she also had to sign the check. when i saw the id her name was ""bonita"" which means ""beautiful"" in spanish and it wasn't until i saw her signature did i start to choke up. the most beautiful, fast calligraphy done of the capabilities of a 50 cent pen can do. they paid and left. this was about a year ago and i still think of her.",marmyboo,tfr
127,the time i embarrassed myself,"so this happened a few weeks ago, i still cringe when i think about this event.  i was on register ringing up this lady who was buying a few greeting cards and some flowers, among other things.  the card and flowers were the last items from the cart that i rang up, and then this happened:

&gt;me: *rings up flowers*

&gt;customer: i'm buying those for a funeral, can you take the price off?

&gt;me: sure, you want me to remove the price tag?

&gt;customer: (doesn't answer me) can you take the price down?

so at this point i figured she wanted to see if she could get a discount for the flowers.  i guess i considered that within the realm of possibilities of what she could want, it seemed kind of an odd request since i have never heard of people getting a discount for a funeral but i have seen and heard stranger things from customers, plus there were a lot of flowers and they seemed to be for a charitable purpose (a funeral) so not really all *that* bizarre, or so i thought at the time.  i had been talking to her throughout the transaction and she had been replying so i know she heard what i was saying.  anyway back to the story:

&gt;me: uhh i'll see, i can call my supervisor over to see if we can do that

&gt;customer: ok

&gt;*waits a minute or two for asst. manager to come over*

&gt;me: hi this lady is buying these flowers for a funeral and wants to see if she can get a discount for them

&gt;customer: no no no, i just want you to take the price sticker off of the flower vase!

&gt;me: oh ok i'm sorry! *asst. manager goes away*

i spent the rest of the transaction looking down and probably with a bright red face, and basically thinking to myself ""stackyourpoop you idiot! why would you think she wanted a discount, just remove the sticker!"".  thinking back though, i don't really think it was that unreasonable of an assumption at the time, since when she talked to me she referred to it as ""the price"" and not ""the sticker"", plus when i specifically asked if she wanted me to remove the sticker she didn't say yes.  i also think it was odd that she didn't say anything about me interrupting the transaction and calling over a manager just to take part of a sticker off of an item after it was paid for.",StackYourPoop,tfr
128,no. just because my car is parked in the back doesn't mean it's for sale.,"looking back, my time at a certain family-run appliance store was pretty laid-back.  i played on my laptop for half of the work hours like everybody else, about 5 purchases could supply the daily quota, and the delivery truck came only once a week. i only had one ""bad"" day, but it wasn't story-worthy. my manager basically got a closing competitor's inventory for a bargain, and we had two whole mac trucks of loosely-packed supplies. a few air conditioners were destroyed by toppling off a tower of about 7 units. it was put to the fault of the ones who stacked it, breaking laws/rules. i don't know the details, but they received punishments.

the job was so laid-back that a certain family project, an experimental car built by every guy related to me, got parked in the warehouse to have ""professional"" work time. our tools were way better than the ones in the wooden shed. the ""experimental"" part of it was whatever way we felt like powering it that month. it ranged from small gas motors, to electric, to water attempts, to even rubberbands and industrial springs we found in a junk yard. only the obvious worked so far. 

i didn't so much power the car as i was better at styling and interior. i put a small tv and radio in it, and styled the body like a rocket. i can't give a photo, but here's a sketch of my original intention that i made:

[https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl](https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl)

this thing was never, and will never be for sale. it's just a family tradition at this point. it's been a solid 17 years of grease and welding.

sometimes people would see it through the windows of the storage room door and ask questions, but they never assumed that it was up for purchase given it's rough appearance. a few kids even sat in it and played with the controls that usually weren't plugged into anything.

however, this story wouldn't exist if this guy, da, didn't come in one day. he even had a wife, who i'll call gw for ""good wife"".

i'll be op, and there's two coworkers/family members c1 and c2.

da: what the hell is that?

op: it's a project car.

da: how much is it?

op: oh, it's not for sale.

da: but it's in the store. you have to sell it to me.

op: that's not true.

da: don't argue with me! my son has been looking for a car for months, that thing will do fine!

op: it doesn't even have an engine in it.

da: then how did it get here, huh?

c1: we got a trailer. it's parked outside.

his face was getting red.

da: sell me the car. 

op: it's not for sale.

he basically said the exact same thing for about 5 minutes until he walked off to his wife, who was just looking for a decent stove. we went about stacking shelves until he suddenly disappeared. i had c@ look around while i checked the cameras in the back next to the car. as soon as i got to the window, i saw this guy in the drivers seat, rapidly turning the key and messing with wires trying to turn the car on. i called c1 and c2, c2 watched the store from the door as we walked over to da with our arms crossed.

c1: you're kidding me, right?

da: this car is terrible! you can't sell it like this! this is horrible service!

is this guy serious?

op: this car is not for sale, and the engine is currently suspended over your head.

da looked up and saw a strange amalgamation of metals and plastics with stray splashes of paint and wires everywhere. i still don't know what it's intent was, but it was the engine.

he sputtered in anger, red like mcqueen, as his wife stomped in and just glared at him.

gw: what are you doing? 

da: they are refusing to sell this car for our son.

gw: what? this is piece of crap!

might sound rude, but i did nickname it ""mr. ugly"" so i don't care.

da: i can fix it up!

gw: no! we are getting him the honda, end of story!

da: i am getting this car, and none of you can stop me!

c1: sir, you are trespassing and possibly damaging our property. leave now, or i will call the police.

he has two options: forget the non-functioning, experimental, rusty, three-wheeled joke of a car; or get arrested.

he got arrested.

banned from the store and paying a fine. all the money we got out of it was put into the car, of course.

129,"no id, no beer","this is my first time posting. i have only been reading these stories for about a week now. i realized i had a few stories to share, so here is one that made me laugh a little. sorry for the length of the story in advance.

c= customer
me= me (obviously)
s1= supervisor 1
s2= supervisor 2

just a little background to start. i work at my local grocery store (in canada) and we started selling beer and wine a year ago. our system is set up so that when it’s rung in we have to put in a date of birth. when we started selling we had to look at everyone’s id, no matter the age. after about 9 months of selling we started just asking for a dob from anyone who looked over 30. well, this guy came in drunk one night and actually fell into our beer cooler and caused a scene when we refused sale. since then we have always had to id him, even though he’s in his 40’s.

fast forward to the end of february this year. i see him come in and he went straight for the beer. he comes up with a 6 pack and some food. it’s almost 9pm. my supervisor that night is at register 5, i’m working the self-serve checkouts. the customer comes to self-serve. he rings in the beer and this is the conversation that follows.
me: hello, do you have id?
c: no, but you’ve seen it before. (yeah, months ago.)
me: i’m sorry but without id, i can’t let you buy this.
c: but it was stolen from my dresser!
i look to my supervisor at that point.
s1: i’m sorry, but no i can’t let you buy it without id, it’s policy.
the customer stands there. starts to sniffle a little, like he’s about to cry. i stand there awkwardly because i’m waiting to take the alcohol back to where it belongs.
c: is the beer store still open?
me: for about 10 more mins. (the beer store is literally in the same shopping strip.) did you want to buy any of the food you have there?
c: yeah, i’ll get just this.
he rang in a small chicken wrap and left the store after he paid.

it was the first time i had ever had to refuse sale for alcohol. it was really awkward and i never wanted to do it again.

2 days later.

the same customer comes in and again i’m working the self-serve checkouts. this time it’s after 10:30pm (we close at 11pm), i have a different supervisor on this night. we’re both standing at the podium where we can see what is being rung in at each self-serve registers. the same customer comes up with a 6 pack. this time the conversation is a little different.

me: hi, do you have id?
c: ugh, seriously?
me: yeah, we need to ask every time.
c: i’ll figure something out. (he leaves)

my supervisor put back the alcohol he had. and we were concerned on what would happen if/when he came back.

well, it had been about 5 mins, we see him come back in and i’m at one of the self-serve registers printing stuff off. he comes up and shoves his id in my face, it’s a proper id and looks used. like it’s not brand new. 
i was confused for a second because he had told me 2 days prior that it was stolen from his dresser. it takes about 2-4 weeks for a new one to come in the mail if you apply for a new one. so i started questioning to myself if it was really stolen.
he was annoyed that he had to go back and grab his beer again. after he paid and left i had a conversation with my supervisor.

me: his id was dirty, not brand new. he was in two days ago and claimed it was stolen from his dresser. did whoever stole it give it back? also, why would it be in your dresser?
s2: i don’t know, but at least he had id this time. we’ve been asking him for months now for it.

but, the lesson here is, don’t be drunk and cause a disaster in our store by falling into the beer cooler. also, always have your id on you just in case we ask because it’s in our policy that we are allowed to ask you.

130,"old lady tries to buy flowers, is in a rush, her dog tries to bite me while i'm helping.","(first time posting on reddit)

so last spring, i worked at one of the big home improvement chains in the us as a seasonal employee in the inside garden section. i sold everything from lights to grills. now, at this store, their outside garden section was always understaffed, especially on weekends, so as a 20 year old male, i was often pulled outside to help. (i think they picked me because i rarely complained.)

one hot, windy day on the weekend i was working inside when i got a page to go outside and help the cashiers. often i would get called out to help someone load bags of mulch or soil into their cars because the cashiers couldn't leave their posts. so i walk up to the cashier and there's an older woman  (maybe late 50s) with four large flowers in ceramic pots in her cart, with a few small bags of stuff (don't remember what they were).

**cashier:** (my name), this customer needs help loading these items into her car.

**me:** (smiles at her) 

the lady smiles at me as i take over and push her cart out into the parking lot. 

now, for context, the outside garden section is mostly open air, with large black bars around the interior section. between the parking lot and the bars is a section of concrete that is used for displays of flowers, trees, lawnmowers, etc. there's not a lot of space there, hardly enough for people to walk through with carts usually.

so we walk out and she has parked her car (an suv) right in the middle of the displays. she didn't knock anything over, but alarms start immediately going off in my head. to this day i have never seen someone park where she was. and there were plenty of parking spaces. i steel myself internally for what may come.

she opens her trunk for me and there is stuff everywhere. books, papers, binders, all seemingly tossed in there. and there is a dog in the front seat of the car, who immediately starts yapping at us.

**me:** ma'am, want me to go and get some of our plastic sheets that we use to protect cars from getting dirty?

**lady:** yes, thank you.

so i hurry back inside and rip off a few of the sheets from the stand and hurry back, the sheets flapping in the wind.

i manage to lay a sheet down in the back and place the bags she had bought in the trunk. meanwhile, she's trying to help me, but pushing me out of the way as the flimsy plastic flops around, all while telling me this sob story about ""how i didn't know that i needed all of this"" and ""so-and-so just called me and asked me to pick this up"" and ""i need it tonight""

i just kept nodding and finally managed to secure the plastic in her car. 

but we still have to get the four plants into her back seat. it's still windy and the dog has been continually barking at me.

(i have a fear of dogs stemming from childhood, but i'm fine as long as they don't bark at me. so i'm increasingly on edge. the dog is small, chihuahua size)

now since she has parked in the middle of the displays, i can't open the right side passenger door very much, let alone fit the plant in, because there is a tree next to me.

the lady is still suggesting different methods to place her items in her car, and i'm trying to be polite but my patience is waning. the dog is trying to get up over the front seat to bark at me so she opens the front passenger door to calm her dog down. i manage to place the plastic in the rear passenger seat during a lull in the wind. i start to place the plant in her backseat. 

i'm trying to get around the door (against the tree) and place the plant in the car without nicking the leaves or flowers, so my head is facing the steering wheel and my right ear is barely in the car.

i've just set the plant down the dog shakes loose from the lady's grip, leaps over the seat, and bites my ear.

i recoil out of the car and stumble back a few paces, my right hand going up to check my ear.

**lady :** buddy, get back here right now! bad dog! bad dog!!!! you are in big trouble! no outside playtime for you!

i can see through the car that she has put both hands on her dog and has yanked it back into the front seat. my ear stings but i don't see any blood when i pull my hand back down.

at this point i've lost my patience with this woman. she apologizes to me as her dog increases it's yapping.

**me, in a low but firm voice:** alright, i am going to place this plastic down. take this plant and put it on your side. i will put the other three in.

the lady goes quiet and follows my instructions, fortunately the dog stays up front. we get the plants in her car. i back out and stand by the parking lot so she can get into the drivers seat.

**me:** have a nice day! (back to my cheerful tone)

**lady:** thank you! (as what had happened was totally normal)

she gets in her car, pulls out, and drives away.

when i walked back inside the store, the cashier asked me what the shouting was about. i told her and she gaped at me, along with another customer who was waiting in line. my ear had a few red marks on it but there was no blood, so i went back to work, but not before moving some displays to block that spot off.

131,man claims to have had a car 30 years ago that i designed only 8 years ago.,"i could go into detail about what this car is or why, but just know my family built it as a project to make the weirdest engine possible. because we practically owned a store with a lot of tools, it tended to get parked in the back room with the appliances. i personally only worked on the look of it, so the mechanics were only vaguely described to me.

here's a sketch of it i have:

[https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl](https://sta.sh/01ii5y2cy2rl)

since a hwy55 was next door, they held a ""classic car show"" outside, so this thing got parked outside for fun. i think we just put in a gas engine at the time for little rides.

i was working, so i just looked outside at it while people were constantly being told what it was. all the extra engines and parts made it seem like we were trying to travel through time.

this guy, c for customer, came in after looking at it for like 30 minutes. he was getting lawn mower parts pretty slowly, and telling me about the car. 

c: you know, i had one of those up until 30 years ago. drove it off the showroom floor in good ol' 54.

op (me): what? no you didn't.

c: course i did. buddy of mine gave me a deal. i had a lot of women in the passenger seat.

op: sir, i can hardly believe you drove that car in 54. 

c: of course i did! 

op: what company made it?

c: a german company. they're always making weird models.

for those who are interested, there's this thing called a messerschmitt bubble car. i researched it for inspiration, but they don't look that alike. our car is also twice as big.

he went on to specific (false) details and how he had to fix the engine. stuff like the radiator, which we didn't have, and an exhaust, another non-existent part. this car definitely isn't street-legal, by the way. we put it on a trailer.

he finished getting his parts, i rung him up, and i proceeded as follows.

op: by the way, did i mention i designed that car?

c: what?

i pulled out a book filled with past designed and specific parts used. i pointed out that there were at least seven other cars in that experiment outside. the headlights were from a 3rd-generation corvette, the odometer was a rambler, the radio from a mid-80's truck, a tv i found in the closet, etc etc etc.

c: that's...strange. 

i had the most ""done"" look on my face. he gave up and paid for his stuff. he looked at the car and i could tell he was piecing it together how idiotic it was.

i doubt he had a bubble car. getting ""ladies"" in one of those is highly improbable. any pair who aren't thin as twigs will get freaky in the space as big as a wooden roller coaster car's seat.",Scarlet-Ajani,tfr
132,ma’am you threatened a customer. no we won’t give you a discount.,"this story happened a while ago so it’s kinda fuzzy. but crazy none the less. 
me: me (obviously). vc: violent customer. m: manager

so the story starts as a normal day at work in an average retail store.  also, the store itself has a reputation of getting the absolute worst customers ever entering the store. this one was one of the worst. 

at that moment i was standing at the turn in the main isle between two departments. the store is pretty compact and not a lot of room to move around. so you can imagine how many times i have to politely ask a customer to move over so i could get through. this time, one customer (vc) with a cart was coming around a tight corner and nearly running into another customer without a cart. the one without the cart said sorry and started to walk away.

then all hell broke  loose. 

vc: yeah you better be sorry. you just ran around and nearly hit me. 

i was watching the whole thing and it was vc that nearly hit the other customer. the customer that said sorry did the smart thing and just walked away. 

vc: (yelling at the customer walking away) next time you do that you’re going to get a broken head!!! 

she yelled that in a crowded store. threatening another person. 

many other people including me, fellow employees, and the manager heard and/or saw this go down. vc sees me walks up to me and says the following. 

vc: did you see what she did?

me: yeah i saw that whole thing (notice i didn’t explicitly say whose side i was on there)

vc: that b**ch could have seriously hurt me. 

me: (trying to defuse the situation) well no one was hurt so there is no need to go any further. 

vc: i want to speak to your manager!!!

m: (who was no more than 10 feet away) is there a problem ma’am?

vc: one of your employees almost hit me. 

m and i just look at each other. 

me: that woman didn’t work here.

vc: yes she did and i demand that i be compensated for almost being injured in your store. 

m: (clearly just as curious as me) and how would we do that?

vc: i want you to take 50% off my entire purchase!

wtf?!? this woman just threatened a customer whom she almost hit with her cart. then she claimed it was an employee who nearly hit her to get sympathy. now she’s trying to get half off all her products for something that never even happened. 

m: (shocked and getting frustrated) ma’am we cant do that. first of all that woman didn’t work here so the store was not responsible for her actions. also you proceeded to threaten her health and safety. which would mean we have the grounds to ask you to leave. but we aren’t because no one was hurt and that ordeal is over. 

vc then proceeds to push her cart away from her and i just catch it at the last second before it hits me in the legs. 

vc: fine then!!! im leaving and never coming back!!!

vc proceeds to leave the store leaving us to put away all the things she abandoned with us. something every retail employee hates doing. 

the manager and i would laugh at that for a long time after. while it was funny we had to feel for anyone who has to deal with her on a regular basis. 

bottom line to all my fellow retail employees. keep an eye out for any customer like vc who will just make up lies to get a discount on whatever useless things they want to buy.

134,customers are why we no longer have a fitting room.,"first time posting on this sub reddit, so sorry for my poor grammar or spelling.

i've worked at the same thrift store for four years now and the same question i get asked is ""do you have a fitting room?"" i say no every time i'm asked but i rarely go into detail as to why we don't. reason: about two years ago, we converted one of the store bathrooms into a fitting room. sucky right? all that was done was that the toilet was taped shut alone with the sink as well. it was well received (i think...) by customers. we only had two simple rules, them being: you can only take in three pieces of clothes and any clothes you didn't want had to be hang up on the rail outside of the room. 

barely anyone followed these rules!

back when i was working retail for this job, one of the thing i had to do was take clothes on the rail and check the fitting room for any clothes. there would be more clothes on the room floor than on the rail itself. once near the end of night shift when the last thing i had to do was check the fitting room. once i open the door, there was least two carts worth of clothes on the floor! not just clothes but purses as well, and clothes in the purses... (thinking back, i did see two customers with carts full of clothes, never saw where they went with them. guess i know now.) if it wasn't clothes on the floor it was people untaping the toilet and using it and not flushing which did make the room itself smell really bad. plus since this was a closed off space and out of sight of cameras, people used it as a way to steal clothes.

after about a year of this, the higher up finally shut the fitting room down and turned it back to a regular bathroom. thank god as it was a fucking pain the maintain.

&amp;#x200b;

last summer i made a table thing to go over my wagon so i could set up a lemonade stand, which i ""premiered"" on the 4th of july.

it was probably one of the best decisions i've ever made, as i live close to a park which hosts a carnival and then fireworks.

 car after car stopped to buy lemonade, some didn't but most did. about three hours in at about 7 pm, sales started to slow down as parking spaces were running out.

 a few of the neighborhood kids were hanging out with me as well as one of my friends. after about 30 minutes of no cars, a ray of hope emerged: a blue prius. at first, seeing it was a prius i expected a karen, but what i got was a surprise.

 a middle-aged man with a thick russian accent, with three kids in the backseat, who looked incredibly worn-out. he stopped and asked for four cups, each priced at 50 cents.

137,gifting away pencils,"i used to work in a small chain of bookstores/stationery shops. we’d sell books, pens, paper and so on. always hated to advise customers which pencil is best, from the most famous brand there where 3 types, red, blue and green. 99% of all people (and schools) need the red ones, customers still wanted to know the difference and why you wouldn’t recommend it. if explained they still wouldn’t understand the difference between them. and they did cost about 80 cents each, making selling them annoying.

&amp;#x200b;

one day a mother and a child entered the store, rather poor looking. it was the beginning of the school year. she wanted to buy a pencil and started to search for some scrap change in her wallet. just a few days earlier we got a package with promotion material from a publisher, literally hundreds of pencils. now we couldn’t really distribute them since it would be counterproductive, people wouldn’t buy our pencils and ask for the free ones.

&amp;#x200b;

thus i ask the kid and mother if it really needs to be a brand pencil, both decline. i grab as many pencils i can, giving them to the mother and child. i don’t think they ever saw that many pencils at once, they could barely hold them. after i told the mother that they can have them for free she almost started crying and thanked be a thousand times…

&amp;#x200b;

gave them a bag for all the pencils and they left.

138,old lady doesn't understand phones.,"ftp, ltr, on mobile, etc.

i have an autoimmune disease and work 5 hour shifts 2 days a week at a local pharmacy. 

i've just clocked out and am trying to grab my stuff to go home. i'm behind a register because i forgot my drink and phone.

old lady comes up to where i am.

ol: did anyone find a pink phone?

me: no, sorry. i've been up here all day and no one's turned one in. we can keep an eye out though.

ol: do you want to take my number to let me know if you find it?

i started to have a bad feeling here. like a stupid-o-meter going off.

me: uh... is it a home number?

ol: i don't have a home number.

i can't talk a second. she wants me to call her missing cellphone... to let her know we found her cellphone. stupid-o-meter at a 7.

me: well, we can't call the phone to let you know we found the phone... sorry...

i thought this is when she'd realize her mistake.

nope.

ol: *storming out* ridiculous! you think they'd have a phone they could use!


i stare after her, thinking, *lady, how would you answer???*

final level of stupid-o-meter: 9/10

normal day, ordinary woman. i ring through her items and she tells me she wants to use a card, no problem, press the button on my screen for it. she slides her card and the card reader beeps, basically saying, 'i know you're trying to use a card but it's not going through.' after probably the fifth or sixth time of swiping the card reader wants her to manually type in her card information.

i know this is really annoying but there really isn't another choice unless she wants to wait on her items. i apologize and tell her she'll just need to type it in with the pin pad.

me: ""i'm sorry?""

woman: ""the expiration date.""

140,being nosy at work led me to having to clean a puddle of an 80 y/o woman’s blood,"i’m back with another story from the place i worked at when i was in high school. this happened at the same place where i sliced my finger trying to show a customer a knife. 

when i first started working at the store i worked in the health and beauty department on the first floor. after a couple months i got moved up to work in the bedding department upstairs. one day i was upstairs just folding things and then i hear someone say “we have an emergency on the first floor by the escalators” over the walkie. i was immediately interested and dropped what i was doing. i had to make it seem like i was already on the first floor so i went through the office and the back stairs so no one would see me going down. so im on the first floor now and make my way to the escalators. when i got there, there was the store manager, the fe lead, an older woman being held up by another woman and a puddle of blood. idk what happened but i heard two things that the old lady had snagged her ankle on a peg upstairs or that she had cut her ankle on the escalators. either way this woman was bleeding and there was a lot of blood. ambulance came and took her, she was fine. the whole time she was cool and mostly trying to calm her angry daughter down. she was really concerned about where her shoes were.  once they were gone it was just me, the fe lead, and the store manager left. the store manager went to make a report and that left me and the fe lead to clean the puddle.

am + wam ; they needed to find a piece of jewelry to get for someone, i don't really remember who. general gift search.

me; hmm, yes what?

wam; that locket type necklace

me: yes okay! gimme just a lil' moment \~

wam; that and that one too.

*i started to unlock the display case to remove the items, i ended up just grabbing the whole thing. trying to get the individual pieces of jewelry would have been* ***hell***\*.\*

they started talking to each other a little bit.

wam; hey look. she's not wearing a ring!

am; i see that yes. hmmm.

*i don't really remember what else but they were talking about their son. and how he needs a girlfriend, to get married she's available no ring yes and all that general thing that couples will talk about.*

the whole thing was really sort of silly and weird. i didn't really know how to react and it definitely wasn't bad.. but i don't get why these two random strangers would think the sales girl wants to be with their son.

143,your fridge is for my personal use,"i work in a small wine shop and this happened earlier today, but a little backstory is necessary, so bear with me. 

we have a small fridge for white and sparkling wines that are on promotion. on friday, i noticed a bottle of premium champagne that didn’t belong on a random shelf in the fridge, in front of the white wine. i presumed someone had put it down when they saw the cheaper champagne in the fridge, so i put it back on the non-refrigerated shelf. 

today, a woman came in and brought a bottle of the premium champagne up to the till. she told me that she had left it in the fridge on friday and wanted to know why it had been put back?! 

i explained to her that it didn’t belong there, and that the fridge wine is carefully chosen because space is limited. she just kept saying that she didn’t understand, so i after i explained merchandising and why a random bottle won’t be left in front of other wine, she decided to get snarky and asked if i was gonna remove the security tag from her champagne. it took all of my willpower to not sarcastically blurt out: “no, i’m gonna leave it on and wait for you to set off the alarm at the door.”

she basically thought that the shop fridge was for her own personal use and expected her champagne to be kept there for two days.",walterswhites,tfr
144,no...i'm not gonna let you buy that for your probably underage daughter.,"so this happened earlier today when i was put on the tills (because short staff, yay! love you guys!)  

a young girl (est. 14/15) had come onto my till with her dad, but they were paying for their stuff separately, anyway, the dad buys his stuff, and the girl pays for her stuff.  

but there's a bit of a problem, this girl, who is pretty small and very young looking, is trying to buy a bbq lighter, so as per the policies (and *the law*) i ask for id, and this goes down:  

&gt; me ""hm...can i see some id please?""  
&gt; girl ""oh, i...don't have it on me.""  
&gt; me ""well i'm afraid i can't sell it to you then.""  
&gt; dad ""oh i'll buy it for her.""  
&gt; me ""uhh...no, i know it's for her so i won't allow you to buy it for her.""  
&gt; dad ""oh okay then""  

i then called for a member of management to come to my till since i have to get them to scan saying i'm refusing a sale (or if i just hit the wrong button by mistake like the idiot i am sometimes), and lo' and behold, my supervisor was right next to me, watching the transaction, i didn't even realize it and i just felt so relieved yet anxious because of what could've happened.  

but atleast the two were alright about it, i wonder what goes through their heads sometimes...  

edit: yes i'm fully aware that they're buying a bbq lighter, not a normal lighter, however i can't do anything about the till saying i need to check their age and maybe even id them, plus like i said, my boss was right next to me, i'm not risking the job and my normal criminal-free life for a god damn lighter.",HoneyBadger162,tfr
145,i'm closed.,"so here's one that happened to me today that i can't stop thinking about, so i'mma share it with this subreddit.

so i was doing cashier as is my job at a store nefarious for customers that don't listen.  i've had the problem often where my checkout light'll be off and even 5-10 minutes later people'll still be coming on line, like i'm suddenly going to ignore break time because they can't wait an extra two minutes.

i was checking some people out and my manager tells me to turn off my checkout light and go on break, i loudly repeat her and she confirms.  i had a line about 6 people long (bless weekend peak times) and i told the line that i'm closed and to tell anyone else to leave if they got on it.  i was down to two people left and two more came on within 30 seconds of me taking my current customer's money and me noticing the next person in line.  i tell them i'm closed, and they get angry at me.  i tell them i'm not going to argue with them, but i'm closed and can't help them so they leave.  as i finish my last person, two more different groups of people hop on my line, i tell the one loading stuff onto the belt i'm closed, and they ignore me entirely.  i say it again, same thing.  i say it one last time, louder, and just walk away.

ten minutes after this happened, while i was in the breakroom, my coworker who was in the lane next to mine comes into the break room super frustrated telling me how the people i was telling i was closed to (she didn't mention who, hence me saying the whole bit) were complaining to the manager about how i refused service and ignored them.  she went on for a while, reiterating that i said i was closed to my other coworkers in the breakroom and reenacting how upset the customers were, demanding to speak to a manager about my horrible customer service.  heh.  god i love being a cashier at a store where no one cares if it conveniences them even slightly.

146,customer picks something off a shelf and tries to get a refund for it.,"i don't make reddit posts that often so apologies in advance if this gets too long-winded.

&amp;#x200b;

i work in a supermarket in an area that isn't exactly that nice. there's a lot of theft in the area and because of our lack of staff we struggle with it a bit and lose quite a bit of money.

&amp;#x200b;

so it's friday night, and we're understaffed. there are three main areas of the shop floor, and store policy requires us to have at least one person on each of them: the checkouts, the self-checkouts, and the customer service desk. but because we don't get that many people coming for customer service, we can usually get away with having only two people managing everything.

&amp;#x200b;

not this night, though.

&amp;#x200b;

we have a guy come to the service desk looking for a return. he has 2 or 3 phone-charging cables, adding up to about £30 of merchendise. he's deaf, and i wasn't the one helping him, so i could only glance at what was happening. he claimed that he bought them earlier that day (at a time where neither i or my supervisor were in) and that he wanted to return them. no receipt. that's not that uncommon, and we have to give people the benefit of the doubt. however, we cannot give cash on returns without receipts, so all we can offer him is a gift card with store credit on it.

&amp;#x200b;

not good enough, apparently.

&amp;#x200b;

he gets rather annoyed, then suddenly claims he has a receipt on his phone (which seems inconsistent, but he may have claimed that he bought the items online, i'm honestly not sure.) my supervisor looks at it, and then realizes something inconsistent. online receipts come with a reference number, and when she looked this one up, it came up with printer ink cartridges, not the charging cables he had on him. so, her response was the same, the receipt wasn't the right one, so she could only offer store credit.

&amp;#x200b;

the guy doesn't like this, so he complains and at that point, my supervisor decides to bring one of our managers into it. she comes along and does the same thing, explaining to him that without proof of purchase, we cannot give out any cash. he's insistent that he bought them, so her response is to check security footage to see if he did buy them or not.

&amp;#x200b;

now, this went over the course of an hour and a half, and while it went on, my supervisor had to leave and to into the warehouse part of the store, which left me on my own. store policy dictates that the self-checkouts, under no circumstances, can be left alone at any time, meaning i was pretty much stuck there. which wouldn't be so bad if i didn't have customers coming and demanding that i open a register for them. we get a lot of old people who either don't know how to use the self-scans, or don't want to. either way, i'm on my own and having to deal with them while this situation is handled, and they're not happy about the fact that i can't do two things at once. still, i managed to pull through.

&amp;#x200b;

it was about an hour and a half since the customer arrived, and my supervisor came back to tell them that footage was being checked, so he'd need to wait a bit longer. he lost his patience, clearly not happy that he was waiting so long for this, to which my supervisor just said ""you should've taken the gift card!"". point is, he's tired of waiting, so we take his details, and he leaves. my manager and a security staff member come back, and as the title gave away, it turns out that he had just walked into the store, picked the items off the shelf, and gone to the desk to get a return. the guy was trying to get a refund for stuff he hadn't bought.

&amp;#x200b;

the funniest part is that he could easily have swindled us. he could've walked out with the cables, he could've taken the gift card, but nope, he was adamant on having cash for something he stole. what grated me the most was, thanks to him forcing my supervisor to run around and check stuff, i was left on my own to do the work of 2-3 people. still, kudos to my supervisor for realising what was. since it was late, some people would've just accepted the online receipt and given him cash. still, i hope that this huge waste of time taught that guy a lesson.

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr - a guy brought in some stuff for a cash return. meaning my supervisor had to go into the back to check it out, leaving me to handle a friday night shift on my own. turns out he didn't buy them in the first place.

&amp;#x200b;

she's with her son, and she tells me she needs to buy her son a bunch of camping gear for an upcoming trip next weekend. i tell her no problem i can help. her son tells me that he needs a new sleeping bag, a backpack, and the essentials from a list that he has. i ask him what sleeping bag he has now, and ask him the usual questions, ""where are you going?"", ""how cold is it going to be?"", ""what sleeping bag does he have now?"" i get all my answers and tell her this is what i recommend, and tell her i have the older version of it and it's great. i tell her that it's actually a little better than what he needs, but it will be able to be used for a longer amount of time. it's one of the cheapest we sell, and i tell her a good value for what it is. i pulled two of them out and had him lay in both (it's a pain in the ass to put them back in, she knows this, i know this). after that, i measure his back and pick out three packs that i would recommend, one of them is ""expensive"" (200$), the next two are 150 and the cheap one at 100$. i tell her that i would only recommend the 150 and 200$ ones as they come from a name brand, and are considered by many a great value. i remind her that this is an investment piece that he's going to be using for the next four to five years. i fit him for the 150$ one, and it looks to fit perfectly with a lot of growing room for him. she asks me to put both the sleeping bag and backpack to the side for her. we then move on to the essentials, i pull out a bunch of options from the shelf (most of it stuff i use), i pull the mid and lower priced items, because i didn't want the price to be overkill and i think that he doesn't need the higher priced items. after i pull everything out, i remind her that our pricing isn't high and is on par with rei and other places because there's a minimum price that everything has to be sold at. after about thirty minutes she tells me ""great, i'll see if rei has these, can i take pictures of them""  i remind her a lot of the profits go to her son and his friends. she then replies with ""oh, i was just looking""

&amp;#x200b;

i've done a lot, like a homeless guy scheming about committing fraud in front of me to him asking me for credit card info, from kids destroying merchandise, to being yelled at, ... but this one pissed me off the most.

&amp;#x200b;

tl; dr: i help this customer out with her son, pull out everything we had, he tries on two sleeping bags, and i size him and try on multiple backpacks. i also pick out all of the essential items her son has to have in order to go on any camping trips. i spend 30 minutes with her while the store is packed and one of the busiest days we have seen. she replies with ""great, i'll see if rei has these, can i take pictures of them again"". i remind her that i've personally checked with rei and we have lower prices than them and that her money would go to helping people in our organization like her son and all of his friends. she replies with ""oh, i was just looking""",endermend,tfr
148,customer wants a discount because she doesn’t like the buttons?!?,"so, i work at a western store and today rude lady came in with her husband or boyfriend. not sure which it was. i overheard her with my manager and fellow associate arguing and demanding she get a discount for a pearl snap shirt. there was nothing wrong with it at all, which she admitted. there was no damage or flaw. 

this lady decided she liked the shirt by not the snaps. the pearl snaps. so she demanded we give her a discount because she would have to go home and sew on different buttons for the shirt. just. because. she did not like them. not because it was missing any, but because she didn’t like them. 

her angry plea was “you have to give me a discount because i will have to go home, take off all the buttons, and put on ones i like!”

rude lady ended up almost yelling at my coworker and nearly caused a scene because we didn’t want to give her a discount for a shirt that was perfectly fine. all three of us working agreed there was no plausible reason for a discount. but, my manager ended up giving her a small discount on it just to get her out of the store without further confrontation. and even made my coworker show her and explain that the discount was applied so that she was extra sure it was there. only because, and i can’t stress enough, she hated the pearl snaps. 

tldr: lady at a western store decides she doesn’t like the snaps on a shirt and demands we discount it because she will have to sew on different buttons she likes.

149,he ruined my transaaction,"on break rn, this happened earlier today. i work in one of those stores that has a pharmacy in it, and there is this one lady who uses coupons like crazy. like i think it’s fine if you want to save a little money, but if you start lying that something is on clearance, or photocopying coupons, you suck.

well she bought this thing of mentos and some detergent, and after she entered her rewards card i hit payment, and it said there were digital coupons, so i hit continue. for whatever reason you can’t go back after hitting payment if a coupon was applied and she had another manufacturer coupon that would let her save 2.50, the price was 2.56, so i tried the payment option with it but it said the minimum price wasn’t reached, so i called the manager to void the transaction and try again, eventually we figured out that it was because of tax not being included, and she actually understood and kept one of the coupons for next time.

but then she got a little mad. because the mentos come with a manufacturer coupon that is actually the same price as the mentos, as a little gift, but it’s limit one per customer. (for obvious reasons) and i called my manager over again and she keeps saying “he ruined my transaction” (we had to void it like 3 times, and we tried returning it again twice) but it wouldn’t print, my manager explained there was no way for them to print a manufacturer coupon separately so then, she finally left without buying the mentos. i hear my manager mutter “bitch” as he goes back. this took up like ten minutes, so i wanted to see something for myself. 

i bought the mentos for myself, and behold, the coupon printed. i laughed pretty hard about it. she must’ve bought them before and thought she could do it again, even though when asked she said she hadn’t done it before.",cowslayer7890,tfr

so where to start... i work at a major hardware retailer in the next town over. said work place is about 15 minutes from my house and takes 2 roads to get there. i am on my way to work as usual and going 53 in a 50 (i would go faster but the cops in my area tend to pull you over when you go 51) when all of a sudden jc in his piece of s\*\*\* truck decides i'm not going fast enough and decides to pass me at 65 mph and to do so he crossed a double yellow line. not only did this guy pass me at insane speeds for that road, he also gave me the bird while doing so. i'm mad but i have a pretty good idea of where he is going since one of the few businesses on that road is the place where i work. sure enough when i arrive to work i see his ugly, green, rusted truck in the parking lot. but not just in any space oh no, he was in the front most handicapped spot. i knew this guy was not handicapped as there were no placards or stickers to indicate that he was allowed to park there. i'm pretty pissed at this point because he could not bother to, to wait the whole 30 extra seconds it took to get there. i walk in the door not expecting to do anything or to have the issue resolved. then i see my manager standing at the door greeting customers. bingo.

&amp;#x200b;

me: hey! mod, how are you today?

mod: doing great how about you?

me: great thanks for asking.

me: hey! you see that green truck parked in the handicapped spot?

mod: yeah!

me: he is parked there illegally. don't we enforce that by towing people?

mod: yeah we do but i'm not going to worry about it.

me: well i think we should. at least just this once.

mod: why?

me: \*explains the situation and what the guy did.\*

mod: says she will deal with it and proceeded to call the towing company.

i don't hear anything for a while and clock in and head to my register.

then i hear screaming from the front door. jc is yelling and running toward his truck which is mostly loaded onto the tow truck (it's at the point of no return). he then comes back into the building where he starts cussing out mod and saying that we have no right to tow him.

&amp;#x200b;

mod: im sorry but you did park illegally and we reserve all right to tow vehicles parked illegally on our property.

jc: f\*\*\* you!

mod: well next time don't flip off my associates.

&amp;#x200b;

i don't think he got the idea of what he did and that i was the guy he flipped off but he definitely learned his lesson about parking illegally, i hope. i later heard that he called the store demanding that the associate who reported him was fired immediately, but they dismissed his call because it was ""not directed toward his experience"" and was ""a result of his own actions"".

my manager comes up and he goes back a full year and a half and can't find any sheet purchases on her card. at this point she is starting to go semi crazy and get louder so my manager cuts her a deal, if she buys these more expensive (and better quality) sheets, he will return the original ones she brought in. so off we go for about a full hour trying to find sheets that she will like and stating very clearly that they are more expensive, but will last her longer. i've already gone past where my lunch break should be, but me and the manager are trying to get this done.

&amp;#x200b;

she finally finds the sheets she wants, we order them online, and start to return the gross used sheets, then she realizes it will not be an even exchange and she goes into full batshit crazy mode. screaming about how we promised her a full exchange and how awful our store is and how she demands to be refunded for the sheets she just bought. we have to call to cancel an online order and my manager is fuming trying to tell her he was very clear and just trying to cancel her order. at one point, she demands to be handed the phone and scream at the poor soul on the other line who had nothing to do with the whole situation that at this point, has gone on for probably about an hour and a half. we finally cancel the order and the old bat walks out with her gross sheets still yelling about what an awful company we are to not give her a full refund. it was a wild ride from start to finish and i will honestly, never forget crazy sheet lady.

&amp;#x200b;

(tldr: lady comes in trying to get free sheets by returning used ones. ends up costing us about an hour and a half of me and my managers time, screaming at us for the majority of it. and no, she didn't get any free sheets.",MostWhile8,tfr
152,wanted something interesting to happen at work and ended up in the er,"ok so, this happened a couple years ago. my senior year of high school, i started working at a big well known department store. i have so many stories from working there 2 years, but this one left me with a scar that will forever remind me of the worst job i ever had. 

anyways, i worked on the sales floor in the health &amp;amp; beauty department. the first floor was divided between the heath &amp;amp; beauty department and the housewares department. over at the housewares dept  some guys had ran out the emergency exit with 3 kitchen aid stand mixers. those things were like $400! so, the guys ran out and my coworker (lets call him frank) ran out after them. apparently frank tried to run to their car but couldnt catch up. he came back in and spent like an hour upstairs telling the managers. since he was upstairs, i had to cover the entire first floor. i remember being so bored and thinking, “damn i hope something interesting happens so i can leave the floor” i also just didnt want to work lol 

there was a call over the walkie talkies saying that a customer needed help at the knife case. i went to get the keys for the case and went over to the knives. there was a lady there waiting and asked if she would see the knives.  usually, i open the glass case and if they want to see a particular knife up-close, i take it off the magnetic strip that theyre all on and show them. so there i go, grabbed a knife and showed it to the customer. when she was done looking at the knife, i turned around to put it back on the strip. not even 10 seconds pass, and i hear the customer scream. idk whats going on so i turn around and i ask whats wrong and she points at the case. i turn back and theres blood dripping from my finger. turns out that while i was trying to straighten out the knife on the magnet strip, i guess i also sliced my thumb. there was blood running down my arm, on the knife, on the case, on the floor. i didnt feel anything lol but yeah, i had to leave my shift early and go get my first ever stitch at the er. 


tl;dr: i tried to show a customer a knife and ended up slicing my finger.",_28350,tfr
153,“isn’t it illegal for you to work here?”,"background: i work at a department store and we get a lot of entitled customers and parents (expect me there one day ;3). 

so this story starts back when i first started my training as a cashier. normally i’m on the floor cleaning fixtures or helping customers find items, and i happened to be on register because some people called out.

well fast forward through me fucking up a lot and a lot of annoyed customers to this 50 year old (or so) lady that we’ll call jan.

so i’m scanning jan’s items (one of those long skirts and a purse) and she’s just staring at me for the longest time. when i’m about to ask if she wants to sign up for our reward program she opens her mouth to say: 

jan: “how old are you?”
me: “17 ma’am”
jan: “you look 12.” (this isn’t the first time i’ve been mistaken as a kid. i’m a really tiny asian girl after all)
me: “i’m 17.”
jan: “isn’t it illegal to hire kids?!”
me: *laughing politely* “well you have to be at least 16 to get a job here so i think i’m okay.”

then i told her the total and i never saw her again.

enter om(old man) he just had that look on his face that told me this wasn't going to be easy. he does some light shopping before coming to my register to be checked out. he just throws his stuff on the counter with a huff. 

me: ""hi! how are you?"" 

om: *ignores my greeting* ""i need a pack of -throw in cigarette name here-."" 

me: ""okay.."" i nod and turn to the cabinet and get his cigarettes. ""may i see you id?"" 

om: ""my birthday is.. yada yada"" 

me: ""i'm sorry but i can't sell cigarettes without seeing an id"" 

om: *now a bit torn up* ""i am not showing you my id i am a (incert age here) year old man so i'm sure that i can buy them"" *proceeds to pull his wallet out and hold it away from to counter, showing me he had an id but refused to let me see the damn thing.* 

me: ""well, i'm sorry but i can't sell you cigarettes if you're not going to let me see your id. i am required to id anyone regardless of age."" 

om: ""is your fucking manger here?"" 

me: ""no but she'll be back tomorrow morning you're welcome to come back if you feel the need to speak with her"" 

om: *throws bag of items he was originally purchasing on the counter* ""i'll be back tomorrow morning then. and me and the store manager are going to have a long fucking talk about how disrespectful you and this company has been to a veteran.""

me: ""okay, have a good day!""


he then left without purchasing anything. that's fine. he can come back tomorrow just so the store manager can tell him the exact same thing i told him. i'm sorry but i'm not losing my job just because your ass got insulted because i asked for your id.

155,i wonder what percentage of customer complaints are actually legit...,"fun fact about me: i'm kind of a doormat. i am pathologically polite and helpful. due to this i do not get many legit customer complaints. at least not against me directly. illegitimate complaints however...

years ago i worked at a major retailer at the cell phone counter. part of my job was to help out in the electronics department due to proximity, but i wasn't fully trained in all their products. so their phone rings one day and i'm closest so i answer. it's a man asking if we carry a certain computer cable. what i tried to say was ""i'm not sure, let me go check for you"" or something like that. what i got out was ""i'm not sure, let..."" and the customer hung up. i had no way of calling the person back, and figured they just got disconnected and would call again. wrong. a bit later the department manager comes out and asks me if i took a phonecall about x item. i said yes, why? apparently the guy immediately called back, asked for a manager, and complained that i was rude and refused to help him. dude hung up on me mid sentence and then tried to get me in trouble...

second one is more recent. i'm a cashier in a dollar store. walk in to work one day and my boss asks if i've recently had any altercations with a customer that ended with them leaving their items and storming out. no, i've had zero altercations. she tells me someone called our district manager and said ""the girl with the glasses and ponytail"" was rude, and called them the n word. it's important to note here that my coworker (an assistant manager) was involved in this conversation passively (as if she were hearing of it for the first time). also, i am the only female there with glasses and a ponytail. that's why they thought the person meant me. 

a few days later another coworker was talking about rude customers, and mentioned an eerily familiar situation. customer was unhappy with a clearance price, argued with both this coworker and the previously mentioned one, and ended up leaving her items on the counter and storming out. the kicker? the coworker telling me about this is a male with glasses and long hair in a ponytail. i have no idea if the n word was used as i wasn't there, but the assistant manager evidently knew it wasn't even me and said nothing. i'm still salty about it even though i didn't get in any trouble. they all know i would never ever speak to anyone like that.

156,help from a nice customer!,"so actually have a nice story here! basically filling milk years ago at the supermarket i work for; which is in metal rack/cages with a small latch and a door about shoulder height. filling up no prob; got my gloves on as it's frigging cold! then i have this one cage where the door refuses to budge up - you have to pull the latch then pull the door up and out the little catch bit to get it open. pulling the latch back is fine, no probs there! but the door is as stiff as anything and refuses to move.

i check i have moved the latch all the way, and there's no other catch or anything else preventing it from being opened... nope! it was. not. moving!

did not budge a centimetre! never mind an inch! i give it a good shot; even lifted the entire frigging cage in an attempt to get it open, but it is not happening. think i was at it for about ten minutes straight before my shoulder feels like i'm trying to purposefully dislocate it. in the end, i hurt too much to go it alone anymore, so i go hunt out my boss to help.

she's down the other aisle filling stock herself and after explaining i have nearly injured myself trying to get it open she comes to give a hand. now i'm no stick figure but she's a bit more voluptuous than i am so i think she can maybe use that strength to her advantage.

nope!

even with me holding back the latch and using my weight to hold the cage down whilst she attempts to lift the door up, it has no effect what-so-ever! my boss only gave it about 5 minutes herself (probably smart) before giving up then tells me to wait with the cage whilst she goes to find a male colleague in store. she manages to find another manager, who is male, to see if he has any better luck than we do. my shoulder was still hurting through all of this but i pull back the latch and use my weight to hold the cage down again whilst he attempts to get it open himself.

again; nothing. nada. nope. zero. zip. zilch.

we had all three just agreed on defeat when a young-ish gentleman who obviously goes to the gym (due to his well muscled arms showing) offers to help out. i am beyond caring at this point but think 'why the hell not? one last shot.'

the customer hands his basket to his girlfriend then takes hold of the door whilst both my boss and myself hold down the cage on either side. amazingly, the door starts moving!! agonisingly slowly, but it's moving! we tell him to keep going whilst still pinning the cage down ourselves, then twang! and the lock is out the catch!

yay!!!!

customer didn't injure himself (yay!) and amazingly, the milk didn't fall out and spill all over the floor after all that! yay again! he even got a small round of applause from other customers in store. all three of us thanked him of course and i had a very hot bath that night to soak my shoulder :-)",Magpie213,tfr
157,because i'm blonde,"i work for a large retailer in south africa. to be honest the situation could have beeb handled better. this happened about 4 year's ago 
please note i'm typing this on my phone so forgive any errors i may have made. 

below is the cast
bl= blond lady
c= customer (regular customer) 
s= security 
tm= trainee manager
it was christmas and i just became a supervisor after a previous lady just up and quit so i was still learning the ropes. c came and told me bl in a blue jacket (important) was opening sealed bags of grapes and eating them then placing them back onto the shelves. our policy is you can taste from the shelve that must still be weighed not the prepackaged &amp; priced products.

in the area with the prepackaged grapes was a african lady with blonde hair and a blue denim jacket 
i alerted security and told him what the customer told me, approached her when c came up to and said it was a white lady with a child. i immediately went to them, explained that there was mistake that it wasn't her and asked the customer if she would like to accompany me to a manager.

she exploded saying we were accusing her of theft because she is black. i then explained we were told originally it was a blond women in a blue jacket i'll never forget what she said then.
bl: ""so its because i'm blonde!!!!! ""

i quickly left to get a manager and could only find a trainee manager she refused to talk to the customer said i should deal with it. i felt overwhelmed i wasn't sure what to do i wasn't even a supervisor for 2 weeks, it was my first job ever after finishing high school. 

eventually the customer left and said we will hear from her lawyers.
 a couple of months later i was called in and explained what happened from my side they took statements from everyone involved. luckily i had c's contact details which i took just in case.

looking back now i realized i should have contacted the camera room ti get confirmation but as you can assume i was very inexperienced and didn't have anyone i could ask as we were short staffed people were being fired kdft anx right, hours were being cut to save costs so you can imagine what i was going through.

i still work for the company just no longer at store level, the company is paying for me to study further it was a teachable moment for me that i still think about today and teach others about ",sdarkraider26,tfr
158,lady gets pissed i can't give her money over the phone,"so had been working guest service for a little while and i was usually very excited to answer the phone. i liked helping people and usually it was an easy fix.

our store has coupons for soda that the cashier has to scan manually in order to get the $5 gift card for buying that amount of soda. usually the cashiers are really good about this but mistakes happen. 

so on that day guest service gets a phone call and i answer it. as i'm talking my manager is literally right next to me doing some manager stuff. me=me phone lady=pl manager=m

me: this is guest service. how may i help you?

pl: my son just came to your store and he bought $20 worth of soda and he didnt get a gift card for it??

me: ah yes, our coupons have to be scanned manually to get the gift card. as long as you come in with the receipt we can fix that for you.

pl:......

me: ??

pl: so you want me to drive all the way down there to get my five dollar giftcard??

me: umm.. well yes but it'll be a simple fix and we can get you your gift card right away?

pl: do you know how far away ""30 minute drive away city"" is???

me: i understand that but you would still need to come into the store to get the gift card.

pl: so there's nothing you can do over the phone???

me: no we need to see your receipt, and the giftcards are physical cards that we have to give to you.

pl: what is your name??

me: .... creepyflyer?

pl: well creepyflyer i am going to fill out this survey i have here on this receipt and tell them that you couldn't do anything for me and that you are absolutely useless and i am never shopping there again!

me: if that's what you feel like you have to do.

pl: *hangs up on me*

m: yeah don't worry about that, i'll write in my report what happened. did she expect you to just transfer the money to her bank account?

me: yeah i think so, ""maam, can you just give me your account and routing number and you'll get that $5 transferred to you right away. if you see any randoms charges on your account just ignore them.""

manager and i had a good laugh over that one. i still to this day have no idea what she wanted from me.

tldr: cashier forgot to scan a coupon to get a lady a $5 giftcard. i'm the bad guy for not being able to magically put money into her account over the phone.

159,the little things,"this is kind of a short, boring story but i figured i’d share it anyways since it made my day! i don’t work in retail per-say, but rather as a food service associate in a retail store. i was working the mid shift for the day when two girls came up to my counter. 

os: older sister.
ls: little sister
me: lowly service employee. 

me: “hey, what can i get for you girls?”
os: “can i get a *redacted ice cream confection involving a series of fruits in a quantity less then five but more then three*, and...” looks at ls, “what do you want?”
ls: “i want a mixed ice cream.”

i ring up the girls orders and then make them their ice creams. ls goes and sits down and os stays by me and grabs their ice cream once i’m done making it and thanks me. she goes and sits down and i continue about my day as normal thinking nothing of it. 

several minutes and a few customers later, ls comes back up to my counter. if a customer returns to the front of the line, it’s usually because we ran out of utensils at the condiment counter, or because we forgot to give them some part of their order, or for some other random request or complaint. because of this, we always address the needs of the customers who have already paid and came back up to the customers. i’m helping a customer in line when i see ls standing behind him, eating her ice cream with a fork. after finishing with the customer i’m already with, i turn my attention to ls. 
me: “hey, what’s up sweetheart? did you need me to put out more spoons?”
ls: realizing that, because she came right up to me, i addressed her before the next customer waiting in line. “oh, sorry. no, i’m okay. i just came back up because i forgot to say thank you.”

that was it
that was all she wanted; to say thank you.
this little angel came back up to the counter and stood there patiently until i noticed her just so she could say thank you.
i almost cried. as anyone who works in retail knows, a simple thank you can go a very long way. this child... this saint of a child, absolutely made my whole day. 
to ls, if you ever read this: your actions today made someone else’s day a whole lot brighter. thank you for being such a wonderful human being!",Miss-Scarlette-13,tfr
160,you took to long why would i buy any plastic bags from you?,"i work as a cashier in a local grocery store in ontario. in ontario, you have to pay for plastic bags at most large grocery/retail stores, they’re 5 cents a piece. 

earlier today, this lady comes up to my register and loads up all her groceries onto the conveyor belt, then for whatever reason, she pushes the cart outside and back into the cart return. i found it a little strange seeing as she had quite a number of groceries, but didn’t question it. 

after i finished scanning almost all of the items, i get to the last few which are all produce, so it takes me a while to punch in the codes. i get to the last two items, which are both papayas and she asks me to compare the prices of the two and then asks that i take the lighter of the two off the bill. 

since papayas are priced based on weight and the scale can vary slightly sometimes it takes a few additional steps to remove it off the bill. she apparently has suddenly become very impatient complaining that i’m taking too long (it took me all of about 45 seconds). i apologize and ask if she needs any bags. “why the hell would i buy bags from you? you took too long ringing up my items and you want me to pay extra for some bags? you should just give them to me for free.” she was dead serious. i apologized and said that i couldn’t do that, so she payed for whatever she had (a good 100 or so dollars worth of groceries) and then left. without the groceries. 

now, i was just beyond confused, i had a long lineup of customers who were just as confused as i was. she walked back into the store a few minutes later and grabbed a few items before walking back out. again, more confused looks between me and the customers. she proceeded to do this several more times before i realized that she was loading up the groceries into her car, but since she didn’t have any bags (i mean honestly it would’ve cost her probably 30 cents to get enough bags for her groceries) so she had to make multiple trips. 

the 10th time she came in (i counted) and grabbed the last of her stuff, i told her to have a good day and she spit at me.

mb = my boss

so it’s nearing the end of the work day and it’s been absolutely agonizingly slow. i just want the day to end and this woman walks in. after searching around for twenty or so minutes she finds some clothes she wants to buy and walks right up to the register where my boss (the owner of the store) is working, i’m several feet away monitoring the dressing rooms.

dl: “i’d like to use this gift card first and see how much i owe for the rest” she slides a hammered looking business card across the counter. it’s a very old punch card, you know like the ones that say ‘buy ten burritos get the eleventh one free’ but it’s for every hundred dollars you spend you get ten dollars off your next purchase.

mb: “this expired seven years ago.” she points at the date.

dl: “no. giftcards don’ t expire in this state. its a law.”

mb: “this isnt a gift card.”

dl: “well i know the owner and they said it would be alright.”

mb: “i am the owner and i certainly don’t remember talking to you.”

dl: “i mean the old owner, the one before you.”

mb: “i’m the original owner, ownership has never changed hands.”

the woman is stunned and completely backed herself into a corner, but she surprisingly continues on in making herself look like a moron.

mb: “did you just lose the punch card and found it again only recently?”

dl: “no i’ve had it in my wallet, i just never found anything good enough to buy in here after seven years.”  

an obvious jab at my boss and her store but without missing a beat my boss replies with “ok ma’am have a nice day.” with the biggest fakest smile on her face.

dl: “ well i’m glad you were here to straighten things out!” she says sarcastically 

mb: “me too! have a great weekend!”

162,more coupon fraud,"original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromretail/comments/ak8nrr/coupon_fraud_revenge/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

most of the background info is in that tale, but tl:dr: warehouse store, one coupon per item is the policy but the register system accepts duplicate coupons sometimes due to a bug which is set to be fixed in the next few weeks as we switch to a new coupon system.

anyway, i’m a self checkout supervisor, and today a man (coupon guy = cg) calls me over because he’s having trouble scanning his coupons.

i look at the screen, and it’s a duplicate of one that’s already been applied. however, that’s not why it wouldn’t scan, his finger was blocking the barcode.

&gt;me: so, normally i would put this through for you but since you’ve already applied this coupon, store policy dictates that i can’t.

&gt;cg: well, the register takes them so you’re gonna put them through.

he’s not wrong about the register accepting them, but as i already tried tried to explain, he’s violating the store policy and the terms of his membership (see original post for more details)

&gt;me: the registers have a bug that allows them to take doubles, however all employees know to only accept one per item and the bug is being fixed shortly. i apologize but i cannot do this for you or i will get in trouble.

*corporate is rolling out new coupons over the next few weeks that have more anti-fraud protections. not sure how exactly it works but the coupons are much more specific now and the registers will check them against the items more carefully.*

&gt;cg: well if you’re not gonna do it then i will.

cg grabs the coupons and scans them, then pays and walks away.

a minute later, our loss prevention manager (lp) comes downstairs.

&gt;me: hey $lp, can you reprint the receipt from self checkout #*x*? he pushed through some fraudulent coupons after i specifically told him it was against policy.

&gt;lp: absolutely!

of course, the transaction is linked to a membership. his account has been suspended and flagged for potential fraud, and next time he comes in, he’ll need an override from loss prevention to start a transaction. oh, and he can only go to normal cashiers, who can be more careful about fraud.",ComputerGeek1100,tfr
163,"i cannot change the price. again, i cannot change the price. like i said before, i cannot change the price.","truly tried to make this shorter but this dude was persistent leading to a long story.

for the past 2 years, i worked at a fruit stand during the fall for a local organic apple farm. we mainly sold apples and fresh pressed cider but we had an assortment of edible goods and gift items.

important background: we offer free samples of all of our apples to customers; the employee slices the apple, gives them to the customers, and gives a little blurb about the apple. we sell all of our apples for $2.95/lb. yes, that is expensive but apples are organic and this farm is basically a hobby for the owners. we are also the cheapest in the area because we offered price breaks if you bought a lot of one type of apple. if you bought 10 lbs to 19 lbs of one type of apple, the price dropped to $2.75/lb. the price drops more from there. you cannot pick the apples yourself, so the customer basically tells us what they want and we bag them from the crates in the employee area, weigh them, and label the bags. the stand closes in mid-december and we usually start to start a sale right after thanksgiving on a lot of items but we never put a sale on apples or cider during that sale. the only times we put sales on apples was if the apples were too soft to be used for anything besides apple sauce or it was the week before closing.

so, i'm working about a week after thanksgiving and we just implemented our usual sale. it was a weekday, so it was slow. we were empty when a group consisting of 2 asian couples comes in and are browsing around the stand. the group eventually comes up to the counter and my coworker (cw) starts to help him. i was sorting through apples, waiting to help her if she needed the help to bag apples. they proceed to try all of the apples (around 10 different types) with one man (m1) mainly talking to cw then translating to the wives while the second man (m2) makes small comments in english to m1. after trying of the apples, the wives go back to looking around the store and the men start to order apples.

cw: would you like to buy any apples?

m1: yes, i would like 15 lbs of fuji at $1.50/lb.

cw: i'm sorry, sir. the prices are right here. \*points to our price sign\* we sell apples at $2.75/lb for 15 lbs of fuji.

m1: no. i want them for $1.50/lb.

cw: sir, i cannot give you apples for $1.50/lb. we don't sell any apples for $1.50 right now. the cheapest we have is red golds for $2.00/lb or you can buy 100+ lbs for $2.00/lb.

m1: \*pulls out receipt\* here is my receipt from last year. i bought 15 lbs of apples for $1.50/lb.

cw: \*inspects receipt\* sir, you bought these apples at the tail end of our season last year. we were likely having a sale on apples then, but we do not have that sale right now.

m1: so, you cannot sell me apples for $1.50/lb?

cw: i cannot sell you apples for $1.50/lb.

m1: you sure you cannot sell me apples for $1.50/lb?

cw: i do not decide the prices and i cannot change them for you. therefore, i cannot sell you apples for $1.50/lb.

the men go to their wives and discuss the price. my cw turns to me with a shocked look because we have people complain about the price but never haggle. the men come back up and i decide to help them as my coworker already dealt with them and i could tell it had worn her thin. she ended up going to our storage to start restocking cider.

me: hi, sir. can i get you any apples today?

m1: yes, i would like 15 lbs of fuji for $2.00/lb.

me: sir, 15 lbs of fuji will cost $2.75/lb which leads to an apple total of $41.25.

m1: your coworker said we could have them for $2.00/lb.

me: sir, i was right here when you were talking to her. she explained to you the prices.

m1: no, she said we could have them for $2.00/lb like it says on this sale sign. \*points to a sign discussing the sale on the red gold apples\*

me: sir, that sale is only for the red gold apples. would you like to try them again?

m1: yes. \*tries them and clearly doesn't like them\*. ok. i will still get 15 lbs.\*squints at me\* for  $2.25/lb.

me: they are $2.75/lb. i cannot change the price.

m1: ok fine. i will buy them at $2.75/lb.

me: \*starts bagging the apples\*

wives: \*drop off other merchandise they are buying\*

me: \*finished bagging and places bag on scale for them to see\* here is 15 lbs of fuji apples. \*charge for apples and other items\*

m1: you sure you can't sell me the apples for $1.50/lb?

me: i cannot change the price. i can only sell them to you for $2.75/lb.

m1: not even for $2.00/lb?

me: i do not determine the price. i sell them for $2.75/lb unless you show proof you are a veteran.

m1: you can sell them to me for $2.25/lb. \*winks\*

me: i am just a cashier. i am not the most senior person here at the moment. i can only sell them to you for $2.75/lb.

m1: \*smiles and looks at me\* how about for $2.50/lb?

me: $2.75/lb. your total is $xx.xx.

m1: alright alright. can you use your employee discount on my transaction?

me: no. the owner monitors employee discount transactions and i do not let anyone use my discount.

m1: haha i give in. \*chuckles and hands over his card\*

164,"had a literal panic attack during a stressful and busy shift, the catalyst calls me names during it.","(i don't remember all of the details of this story very well for reasons i will explain later, though it was partially because this happened at least 2 years ago) 

i remember one time during a really stressful and busy period at a [big name retail store], (i was working at the tobacco register that day if i recall) ringing a customer up and the lady wanted me to either ring something up for a different price or maybe use a coupon that was expired or not for the right item or somethinging like that. one of those things that we don't do per company policy. i was hot stressed, tired, and possibly a little low on hydration(these all probably helped to contribute to the hazyness) but i tried to explain i couldn't fulfill whatever nonsense she wanted. the big thing that sticks out to me is her starting to yell at me and then it hit me. 

i had a panic attack. i froze up and just kept muttering ""i... can't, i..can't... can't, c-can't...(ect)"". 

through my hazy memories, i recall another cashier and one of my supervisors coming to the rescue with the cashier taking over the register and due to how hectic things were, i was actually huddled up behind the side of the register; which has like a pseudo wall backing the conveyor belt and shelves on the side not facing the customers; having my panic attack for a few minutes. all the while, the customer who had been yelling at me started calling me names and saying i'm ""faking it"" while yelling at my replacement. a few minutes later, i was escorted to the back of the store, given water, and time to calm down. it took me about an hour to calm down and be back in condition to continue working(my choice, i was a hard worker).

167,service dog triggers lady at grocery store..,"okay so as any story goes you all need some back story:

there was a guy that requested the grocery store i worked at. about once a week he would come to pick up the essentials, only a baskets worth, he did this regularly so i got to know of him and his service dog pretty well. i cannot say for sure why he had a service dog because i was polite and never asked why he has a service dog. the only question i ever asked was what was his dogs name and how old was he. his name was boomer and he was eight years old. he was a bloodhound mix from the looks of him. he had had his service dog since he was a puppy. since he only gets a baskets worth of items he typically would just lay the leash over his service dog while he would grab certain items throughout the store. those are the basic facts. my speculation on why he had his service dog was due to his anxiety. he was a very on edge person and just came off extremely anxious. he was a super cool guy, and his dog was amazing always standing by his side as he walked through the store and standing right at his side as he would check out.

&amp;#x200b;

so now brings us to the tale..

as always the guy with his service dog came through my line and i greeted him, having casual conversation as all cashiers do with their regulars, i thanked him and told him to have a good day.

10 minutes later a woman came through my line who was a typical karen/sharon type. and here is how the conversation went.

lady: about 10 minuets ago i saw a man in here with a service dog.

me: yes, he is a regular, he is in here a lot.

lady: well he wasn't holding the lease when i saw him.

me: oh...well he has had the dog for awhile and he is very well behaved so the dog stays by his side very closely.

lady: that is so dangerous he could have hurt someone!

me: i doubt that, the dog is there to protect him, he would more than likely only attack if his owner was threatened.

lady: well it is still a dog and it could attack anyone at any opportunity. 

i literally just stared at her. i was not sure what she wanted me to say at this point. i also thought she was being ridiculous so i ignored her and continued scanning her items.

lady: oh so you aren't going to do anything, you are just going to stand their 'shrugging your little shoulders' i doubt that dog was even a real service dog""

when she made a comment about me not doing anything i was so annoyed. she did not know this guy or what he has been through. the dog had a registered service dog vest on (which yes i am aware anyone can put these on their dog but you can just tell the real ones.) she was angry about a dog she had seen loyally doing its job, 10 minutes ago. i don't know what she wanted me to do?! i was just a cashier i have no power over what anyone does in the store, especially one that has already left the store.

after continuing to ignore her rude comments and accusations she said..

lady: i want to speak to your manger

me: no problem ma'am let me call him up.

&amp;#x200b;

i paged the manger over the pa system and after our transaction i told her to go stand to the side and he would be right up.

&amp;#x200b;

5 minutes later the main manager at the time came up to me and asked what i needed, i pointed to the woman and said that lady would like to speak to you about something.

&amp;#x200b;

since they were out of earshot i could not hear the conversation, but when i would look over i saw her point over at me a couple times which i could only assume she was blaming me for the whole situation. 

my manager finished the conversation with her and she walked out of the store. 

i expected him to come up to me and give me 'the talk' (we all know the one after a customer complains.)

all he did was look at me shrug his shoulders, smile at me, and walk back to his office.

168,old ladies are very particular about puzzles and like to throw frogs,"a 2 in 1 story, i'll start with the one that just happened.

i work at a small toy store. we start off our mornings with only 2 employees. i was wrapping a present for another customer when this old woman, probably named karen, came up to me. k = the old lady. everything she says has major attitude and disrespect.

k: are you two the only ones working today?

me: for now, we have more people coming in later. do you need help with anything?

k: yeah i need help, your puzzles are stacked horribly.

me: .....okay, just let me finish this up then i'll be right with you.

to explain our puzzles, we barely have shelf space because our store is so small. we have them all side by side except for ones that face out. the ones that face out are always duplicates and are only facing out to draw attention to them.

i finish up wrapping my present, take a deep breath, and walk over to the customer. i just know she's going to be very... difficult to deal with. i'm newish to retail, this was my first time working with a customer this difficult. i go over to her and i see about 5 puzzle boxes just thrown onto the floor.

me: hi, what can i help you with?

k: i can't see the puzzles you're hiding behind these ones. get them down for me.

me: okay, i'll be right back with a stepladder so i can grab those for you.

when i get back, there are more puzzles on the floor. 

k: those ones back up there. hand them to me so i can see if i want them or not.

i get on the stepladder and start handing her puzzles, which she just tosses onto the floor if she doesn't like them.

k: okay first of all, your puzzles are stacked horribly. you can't see any of them, they need to all be stacked like this! (she points to the ones stacked side by side) and second of all, you can just stay up there and i'll hand you the ones i don't want.

me: i'm very sorry about that, i'll see what we can do about it later. (i have no plans of changing anything, the puzzles are exactly how our managers and the owner want them to be)

k: whatever.

she hands me back puzzles and finally she decides which ones she wants. when i ring her up, she's horribly rude and glares at me for a full minute before she finally leaves.

the second story which happened a couple weeks ago (it's really short):

a different old lady came in, grabbed a frog stress toy and i turn around just in time to see her throw it at me. i catch it thankfully, otherwise it would have left a bruise. ol: old lady

170,weird customer trying to get me in trouble for no reason at all,"i used to work part-time at a normal grocery store, almost every day after school, typically from 16:15 till 22:15 closing the store. this weird thing happened about a year ago and is probably the only ""out of ordinary"" thing that happened to me when i was working retail.

it was close to closing time, about 21:30 in the evening, we were two workers left in the store and not too many customers, as usual. i was stocking the shelves to ease the load for the people opening tomorrow morning. it had been a tough day in school from which i went straight to work so i was a little bit tired, not much though. while i was sorting things on a shelf, a karen/sharon walks up behind me, she comes to ask if i could help her find a certain bag of chips or something similar. she's smiling and being friendly and so am i, nothing special. as i have her follow me to the counter where the snacks are, i happened to yawn a little. she asked something along the lines of ""oh, are you a bit tired son?"" with a normal friendly tone. i just answered something such as:

""yes ma'm, i had a slightly exhausting day at school today before i came here, it's gonna be nice to go home and get some rest.""

at the same time i hand her the chips she wanted. she smiles, thanks me and tells me to take it easy and continues shopping, as i said, nothing extraordinary here at all.

in a matter of minutes i was done doing what i was doing and headed back to help my co-worker at the checkout, we were just 2 at work because it was so late. when i get to the checkout, the lady was also done with her little grocery shopping. i scanned her stuff, she paid and after my usual: ""thank you have a nice evening ma'm"" she answered ""thank you, sleep well tonight"" and headed off. still, nothing special here.

the next day at 16:15 when i got to work, my manager was there and called me into her office and she looked bewildered. the regional manager of the chain was also there because she just happened to be visiting at this time of the week. i obviously had no idea what was going on so i very nervously just sat down. (super nervous because of the look on my managers face and the fact that the regional boss stands right next to her) she started by asking me: ""what on earth were you doing yesterday?"" while i was obviously extremely confused. she went on to tell me: 

""this one lady called in this morning, she told me that she needed help and had asked you for help. she then told that you had just screamed at her to go away and started ranting about how tired you were and how you hated this place and whatnot...""

all i could think of at this point was ""the fuck?"" and i am sure my facial expression said so too. my manager asked: ""do you want to tell us about it?"" so i obviously tell her how it was, that it was a normal smiling customer and i helped her while being very polite, all i did was tell her that i was a bit exhausted, after she had asked if i was so.

my manager quickly checked the security camera footage and now she was equally weirded out by what this lady had complained about. my manager just told me to don't worry about it and dismissed me. to this day i haven't seen that lady again, either she just wanted to fuck me over for no reason or then she's some kind of schizophrenic that can't control that. i will never know. my manager was supportive to me about it as she knew i got quite nervous, but i hate the fact that every time i met that regional manager later on, there was some awkwardness in the air as she was there when i was called in.",N1troking,tfr
171,“do you dare me to chug it?”,"i work for a well known “natural foods” grocery chain as the buyer of the dairy department.   i know my dairy pretty well, including the various butterfat contents of milks and creams (this will be relevant later)

one christmas, a gentlemen happened by who was very upset that his favorite brand of eggnog was no longer available.  he informed me that it had the most fat of all of them, and as he was very fond of fat would add heavy cream to his eggnog.  now, this is objectively disgusting, but i held back the retching noise i wanted to make and suggested to him a local brand of eggnog with a naturally high level of butterfat.   and off he went and that was that.   

except, no.  the following spring the same customer appeared again and remembered me from the last encounter.  he loved that brand of eggnog.  and now he was adding more fat to his diet apparently to “bulk up”, in his words (bear in mind this was a middle aged, overweight guy) and could i suggest high fat milks to him.   i didn’t know what he was talking about, but no use arguing with the kind of crazy who would put heavy cream in eggnog. 

so i suggested the same brand as the eggnog, but their heavy cream.  it comes in a plastic pint container that looks like a ready to go drink.   and without missing a beat, he looks me in the eye and says: “i bet i could chug this.  do you dare me to chug this?”

naturally, i said: no.  don’t do that.  you’ll get sick.   and with a quick motion, he pulled the cap off and proceeded to pound back an entire pint of heavy cream with gusto.   after which he looked at me like a proud five year old holding up a drawing.   i think he was expecting me to be impressed. 

i was not.   but i’ll never forget having had to witness someone be so proud of something so incredibly stupid.  ",tomphammer,tfr
172,there's a line,"so, i decided to add something that just happened to me earlier this week. this is the first time i've posted on this sub. i know it's not much in terms of what most people on this sub have to deal with, but as a ""do-anything clerk"" i don't have those people to deal with. usually.

i work at a grocery store that has a bottle return. i know i am weird, but i actually love dealing with bottle room or doing carts rather than standing up front bagging. (having something to do and an actual objective just works better for me than just bagging). anyway, this usually leads to me being the person who does bottles most of the time when i am on the clock. 
so, i was in bottles this time, and we had one machine down. (the company who works on the machine has come in and it's still not fixed.)

so, that day we only had two machines working and there was a line as it was during the busier part of the day. 

this couple came in when one of the bottle machines was down. i worked on fixing it and they had to wait for another customer to finish their bottles as it was down to one machine. 

so the wife started putting the bottles in the middle machine while i was finishing up with the one to the left. the right one is the one that's completely broken. as it happens, as i fix one machine, the other breaks. so the husband take the left machine as i fix the middle one. it's an easy fix, the door just acts weird. 

after both machines are working, the wife continues putting bottles in the middle machine and i realize that they are suing both machines. i ask the wife to stop using the machine, as there are four other people in line at this point.

she said no. 

&gt;""i had to wait in line, so they do as well.""

they only had 20 cans or so left, so i decided to drop it rather than make a big deal out of it. 

but seriously, don't use multiple machines if there is a line. especially if an employee tells you not to. ",Skywalker638,tfr

175,mom got annoyed because i wanted to check her daughters id,"(on mobile, english not first language)
this story took place while i worked my shift at a local gas station here in germany.

if you want to purchase cigarettes in germany, you have to be at least 18 years old. within the last weeks the company i work for got tested by ""test-customers"" (testkäufer). they would purchase alcohol and or cigarettes and just check if the cashier checks their id. you could really get in trouble for not asking them for it.

with this in mind i ask everyone who looks a bit young for their id.
in came a young lady (l). she told me the number of the pump to pay for gas and also ordered two packs of cigarettes.

me: ""may i see your id?""

l: ""actually, it's in my car right now, shall i get it?""

me: ""that would be nice of you, thank you."" 

since she was so nice, i wondered for a moment if i should just sell her the cigarettes and tell her it's ok, but now that i asked, i had to stick with it.

a few moments later, this women (w) comes to the cash register.

me: ""hi, how may i help you?""

w: ""number x (the number her daughter had not payed for yet, because i paused the transaction until she came back with her id) and those two packs.""

me: (realizing it has to be young lady's mom) ""ah, of course, that will be xx euros, please."" :)

w: (with a very cold, annoyed tone:) ""she pumped gas, so she obviously is 18!""

at this point, my eyebrows almost touched my hairline. being confronted with this level of stupidity, my brain started to sort out which of the 100 reasons i could have for aksing her daughter, who looked really young, i should give her.

me: ""you know, we get tested a lot at the moment. also, i could loose my job for not asking for an id when selling cigarettes.""

she then left without another word. not even a goodbye.

i had a lot more to tell her, for example that pumping gas does not mean anything. there is no law that you have to be over 18 to pump gas. also, in germany you can get a driver's license at the age of 17, if a parent is your co-driver. and hey, here stands this mom. telling me her daughter must be 18 for pumping gas.

i was grabbing the recovery for my department as i usually do when i first show up to work, and that requires me to push a bulky cart to go and retrieve from customer service which is next to a set of registers. given the placement and layout of this, the line for the registers crosses the path i need to take to get behind service. supposedly when i was pushing this cart over to the door i bumped this lady's shopping cart and failed to apologize (because i hadn't noticed). this resulted in a roughly middle aged man who was probably twice my size demanding i apologize to this women and threatening to get a manager(there were 2 of them witnessing the event) if i didn't. i was so terrified i agreed and asked which lady and i went to apologize. she appeared to be a bit older than the man and looked scared of him as well.  


i had to constantly remind myself to breathe because i didn't want to visibly have a panic attack on the sales floor in front of customers. one of the managers came and pulled me into a stockroom after i had continued about my business and told me i handled it as well as i could've and completely understood that i was trying not to have a panic attack at the time. i did take a couple minutes to relax and calm down in the stockroom.

177,i'll have you arrested for doing your job!!,"another post reminded me of an oldie but goodie.

years ago i worked at a convenience store/gas station. we sold typical convenience store items, including beer and cigarettes. a young woman comes in one day and asks for a pack of smokes. she looks about my age (19), so i ask for id just in case. she doesn't have it so i have to decline the sale. she is polite and friendly, and simply says it's ok and leaves. 

she is parked right in front of the store, so i can clearly see her get into a car, and an older woman (ow) get out of the same car and come in. ow asks for the same cigarettes. i tell her i'm sorry, but i saw that they were together and could not make the sale, as i knew the cigarettes were for the young woman. she completely goes off on me. it's been years so i don't remember exactly, but she was ranting at me about how her daughter is old enough, and it shouldn't matter anyway because she (ow) is purchasing them now.

i do what i always do, politely explain that i'm sorry, but it is the law. i cannot legally sell to anyone if i have even the smallest reason to believe they may be purchasing for a minor. if her daughter would like to come back with some id, i will gladly sell to her. but the woman isn't having it at all. she rants some more, and ends it by telling me her husband is a police officer and i'll be sorry, because she's going to tell him all about this. finally she leaves, and i try to puzzle out exactly why i should fear a police officer if i'm following the law...

the funny part? a few hours later a cop walks in. he asks if i was the cashier who handled the above situation, and i confirm indeed i was. so he apologizes profusely for his wife's behavior, and commends me on doing a good job. i only wish she had been there so i could see the look on her face. also, the daughter did come back with id another day. she was never even upset, so i'm not sure why the mom lost it like that.

""but i'm in the picture!""

""ma'am, that only proves that you didn't take this picture. you need permission from the person who's logo is in the corner here""

we went round and round like that for a while, and eventually she uses the self-serve photo copy machine. fine, i can't technically stop you from doing that, i just can't help you. she left all angry because i wouldn't risk my job for her, and a short while later her husband comes in, in full state police uniform, and tries to intimidate me a little. i'm not sure what he thought would be accomplished, but after that the one-hour film service was always conveniently backed up when they brought in a roll. i'm sorry folks, that won't be ready until tomorrow.",HereKittyMcVitty,tfr

i useful to work for a small snack stand in a mall. it was basically a tiny convenience store. one day while i was at work, this middle aged woman came in and started rummaging around the drink cooler. it looked really suspicious( me and the other people who worked there had to keep an eye for shoplifters since it’s super easy to steal from there. ) i walk over to her to see she is moving drinks around in the cooler. that’s when i decided to ask this crazy lady(cl) about her actions. 

me: (asking in the calmest voice) excuse me, what are you doing?

cl: (practically jumps out of her skin because she was in her own world and didn’t notice me) i was just looking for a cold one. (runs away)

this didn’t make a lot of sense to me because those drinks had been in there for hours and all of them were definitely cold. i didn’t think much of this and went back to business. shortly after that encounter, i needed a bathroom break. so when the store was devoid of customers, i shuttered the entrance, put up the back in 5minutes sign, and left. halfway to the bathroom, i encounter cl again and this is what she has to say.

cl: what is your name? i’m going to go get security and get you in trouble.

i wasn’t intimidated in the slightest. i gave her my name and she walked off bragging about how much trouble i was going to be in. i finished my bathroom break and got to work. never saw anyone from security. i like to think that one of three things happened that day. 

1: she went to security and they told that i did nothing wrong and she was wasting everyone’s time. 

2: she went to security, they said that they would do something about it to get rid of her, and didn’t do anything. 

3: she didn’t end up going to security at all, maybe she got distracted by something shiny.

the most ridiculous incident however, happened a few months ago. so this lady came to pick up an envelope containing sensitive and personal information, and as she handed me the delivery notice card, i asked to see her id. she looked at me like i had three heads, and the conversation went like this (""c"" stands for customer):

me: hi there. just picking something up today?

c: yeah. 

*she hands me the card*

me: sounds good. did you bring any id with you?

c: huh? 

me: id? i just need to see it to verify—

c: why the hell would i need id??

me: well, i need to see it to verify that this is for you. it's just to make sure i'm not giving out personal information to the wrong people.

c: well, i'm standing right here! that's my name on the card!

me: i understand that, but—

*she scoffs and rolls her eyes at me, then starts speaking in a really sarcastic, degrading tone*

c: here, how about i show you my facebook, and then you give me my letter? that way we both are happy!

*she pulls her phone out and pulls up her facebook profile*

me: i'm sorry, but that's not going to work. i need government issued id.

c: this is so stupid! it's just a letter! why can't you just give it to me?!

me: i get that it's frustrating, but like i said, i can't just give out sensitive information.

*she then grabs the card back and slams her hand on my till before storming off, cussing me out under her breath*



i honestly don't really understand people who don't carry id with them, especially when the card says specifically that you need it with you. things like this happen almost daily, but i just thought i'd share this one, since it's definitely one of the more interesting encounters i've had working there.

181,just try them on next time dude...,"so this one time this guy comes up to the service counter to return a pair of shorts he bought.  i ask him what the reason for the return was and he laughs and replies ""well my wife says they make me look like an overstuffed sausage so i need the next size up.""  i laugh with him and tell him to go get his new pair. 

he comes back a couple minutes later with his new shorts.  i scan the receipt, scan the tag for the old shorts and then scan the new ones... and... they're the same ones.  the skus are identical, same color, style, and most importantly size.  i say to the customer ""um sir i think you got confused.  you got the same size again.""

he just waves his hand and nonchalantly replies, ""oh i know.  these ones look bigger on the hanger.  they'll fit.""

confused, i ask if he tried them on.  he says no but he's positive they'll fit.  these two pairs of shorts do not look even a little different to me.  i have them stacked on top of each other.  they line up perfectly.  i point to the fitting room that is completely visible from the service desk and no more then twenty five feet away and ask if he just wants to make sure so he doesn't have to waste another trip if they don't work out for him.  he cheerfully repeats himself that they look bigger so he's confident they fit.

i just shrug and proceed with the exchange and he left happy as a lark.

guess who was back a couple days later?  ",whatamelons,tfr
182,"""i rode in on a helicopter...can i have some soup?""","while it's not the strangest encouter i've ever had with a customer....it's up there.

this was a couple years into my time working at the same supermarket from my previous story. like before, i worked in the prepared food area. in addition to a lunch/dinner bar and a chicken bar, we also had a little soup station a stone's throw from the chicken bar. typically, we sold two different soups each day, and customers could help themselves by ladling the soup into cups, then bring them to the register in the dept to ring up. the 'being able to help themselves' part is where the trouble often comes in. as you can imagine, we do sometimes get customers who get themselves big cups of soup and then realize how much it costs and decide they don't want it anymore, or simply leave it at the soup station and never come back for it. annoying, yes, but i digress. this story isn't about those customers.

so i was working alongside one of the cashiers that worked the prepared food register that day. she was a nice, older lady who had been working there for a good, long while, and was a friend of the family. she's been around the block a few times and took no nonsense from anyone. along comes an older man, who went to the soup station and filled up one of our larger cups with soup. he brings it up to the register, and then he starts to tell us about how he had rode in on a helicopter, and then pointed at a scar on his head. we were both utterly confused. i think he might have been trying to tell us about an injury he got, and how he had to be taken to the hospital on a helicopter...but that was not what came out of his mouth. anyway, she rang him up, but he said he didn't have any money on him. he asked if he could have the soup while he waited for his carer to come and pay for it. naturally, my friend at the register refused. he asked us if we could hold his soup until he came back with money. that much we could do, so we set his cup aside and he walked off. guess what? never came back and no carer ever came by. one wasted cup of soup....

but the story doesn't end there. our friendly neighborhood helicopter passenger came back for round two a week or two later. i was working with a different cashier this time (who was still a good friend of mine). i remember seeing him as he was headed for the soup and warning him (my other cashier friend) about what happened with this guy before. i don't remember him trying to speak to either of us at the time and don't think he even went for the soup at first. however, a few minutes later as i was working on my daily workload, our department phone rings. it's the store manager. he asked me if the guy standing in front of the deli paid for that soup he was eating. sure enough, there was the older man, chowing down on a big ol cup of soup, bold as brass. i told him no and confirmed with the cashier to be certain. that was all he needed to hear. now, i didn't witness this myself (had my own work to focus on), but i learned later from a few friends that the store manager had confronted the man after our conversation and told him to pay for his soup and go. the man, you guessed it, had no money. the police were called and the man was taken away.

183,threatened to be maced.,"so for some background, i had just found out about this subreddit and my wife suggested i share this story from a couple years ago. so for some context i used to work at a prepaid cell phone retail shop. so let's begin at the initial purchase, a lady came in and the conversation went as such. 

me- ""welcome to (random cellphone store) how can i help you?""

lady- ""i have $60 and i need a phone that i can make my calls and texts with""

me knowing we had a phone that i could bundle and plan for $60 because it was a model we had just taken off the displays. but let me tell you this is the most basic smart phone i have seen to this day. so i respond...

me- ""sure i can help you with that, but let me make sure that you want a phone just for texts/calls"" 

lady- ""yeah just text/calls and maybe a little web browsing"". 

me-"" alright, figured i'd just make sure because this phone is only meant for that""

so we do the sale set her up with a phone plan unlimited talk/text/data and the super basic smart phone for $60. i thought that would be the end of it but i was so wrong. a little under 2 weeks goes by the same lady comes back in, in a huff and this is what happens. 

lady- ""i need to return this phone it's not doing what i asked you for"" 

me- ""is there something wrong with the phone is it not making text/calls""

lady- ""no it's doing all that just fine but it not able to run any of my games"" 

i stare back at her mildly confused as she places the phone, box, and receipt all in front of me. then look at the receipt and phone being as we did have a return policy but it only had to be within 7 day with less than 90 minutes of talk time on the phone. she was 3 days over the return date and check the phone and she had 5 hours of talk time on the device. then i look back up at her and state ""i'm sorry but i can't return this phone, your over the talk limit on the phone and beyond the 7 day limits for a return."" at this point a 2 people had come in and were waiting in line behind her and after i told her that she began to freak out demanding my manager to come out and return her phone. for the record my manager had quit and district manager was on medical leave for having mild heart attack on the job. at this point she had reached in her purse and pulled out her keys and at which point she threatened to mace me if i didn't return the phone. internally i wanted her to because i was over this whole situation and job and wanted a reason to leave. so i then called the owner of this particular shop and put him on speaker as he told her the same thing i had stated a few times already. she then in one sweeping motion pulled all her crap off the counter and stormed out stating she would never come back here again. turns out the guy directly behind her in line was an off duty cop and said if she had maced me she wasn't just gonna get away with it. so all in all turned out well, helped the guy and person behind him with their purchases and now thankfully out of retail.

184,can i see your id.,"i work at a large british supermarket, and normally work on stock control, so checking dates, doing wastage etc (don't really have to speak to customers, praise the lord) 

however, i recently got told i must become check out trained, so hopped on to do some training, all went well and was left to my own devices. 

now i will let you know, i'm 18 but look about 14 (puberty barely hit me, never mind hard). however i was in full uniform, sat at a till, logged into the till, had scanned many other peoples shopping and was chatting to my colleague. 

a female customer comes up with a bottle of wine and me being extra cautious, ask her for her id, even though i think she could be 30. she scowls at me and literally says, i think i need to see your id before i give you mine, young man. how do i know you work here?

i give her the wtf look, my colleague gives her the wtf look but nope she asks me for my id again. i look at her gone out and say i'm sorry but i need your id, and press for a supervisor. we're now in a standstill over who is giving id, so i calmly stand up, say have a nice day and walk to customer services and refuse to go back to my til, until she has gone.

185,"i don't think you know what false advertising is, lady","i work part time at a large chain liquor store.

my job is to greet customers as they come in and try to sell them wine mostly but i also assist with spirits occasionally. 

it was a slow wednesday night and i see a woman walk in the store with a scrunched up angry look on her face. as she walks towards me i put on my best cheesy customer service smile and ask if i can help her find anything. she coldly responds with ""wine cooler"".

i point her in the right direction and hope that's the last i see of her when a few minutes later i get asked over walkie to do a price check on a bottle of wine in our cooler. 

the cashier told me the customer thought the price of the wine was $7.99 but it's ringing up as $16.99. i confirm over walkie that the price for the bottle in question is $16.99 but i can see how she got confused as some of the bottles got pushed around a bit and if you didn't read the tags properly it's easy to mistake one wine for another.

all of a sudden i see the woman from earlier storming towards me, purse swinging wildly on her arm, a look of utter contempt on her face. 

me: hi i found a different wine in a similar price range that you might like to try? 

angry lady: *almost shouting* i don't like [that brand]. isn't what you're doing here false advertising?? 

me: umm not really because if you look here at the tags the price for the wine you chose is clearly stated at $16.99 and the wine priced at $7.99 next to it is actually out of stock  - it looks like the $16.99 wine got spread out a bit but it is still properly priced and placed. 

next she nudges me out of the way, grabs a random bottle of wine, storms back up to the cashier, and purchases the new bottle. 

the cashier informed me that she inserted her card so hard in the chip reader that the terminal got knocked off it's mount. 

angry lady, i hope whatever was going on for you that day that you were able to enjoy your bottle of wine in peace, but please keep in mind that if you want good customer service you must first be a good customer.

186,"""can i get it 50% off?""","if you've worked in retail long enough you've probably had the same/similar experience.

got a call over the radio for a price check, the customer had two shirts off the same rack that had a sign saying $17, however one of the shirts was ringing up $29. as i was the only one on the floor i went ahead and took a look. turned out it was our fault as there were two different types of shirts on one rack with only one sign (we do something put two different styles on single rack but there needs to be a sign for each program on either end of the rack). 

no biggie! we give the lady both shirts for $17 and i start moving the shirts and getting ready to sign them.

that's when the lady next in line jumps out of line and runs over to the rack (the rack was pretty close to the registers so she could see exactly where i was and over heard the conversation) and sees me with both arms filled with the shirts. 

thankfully i was able to grab all the misplaced shirts before she got over there, cause the second she approached me she asked ""are those the same shirts the other lady had?"" 

realizing she was trying to get in on the mistake and save a few bucks, i told her the shirts still on the rack were $17 and the ones in my arms were $29. i move away and place the shirts in my arms on a table nearby and begin scanning them to see what shirts signed together and what didn't. 

at first she pretend to look at the $17 dollar shirts  a bit, but the second i moved away to get a sign i saw her go over and grab the same exact $29 shirt the first customer had. when i was no longer in hearing rang i told the cashier over the walkie that the customer was well aware of the price of the shirt and to not change the deal for her. 

i thankfully didn't have to deal with her again, but the cashier later told me that she pulled out her phone and said ""i found a 50% off coupon online but there's no promo code or barcode, could you find it for me?"" 

1) the coupon wasn't even on our website
2) we've never run a 50% off, ever
3) we currently weren't running any coupons as there was a big sale going on in store. 

took about an extra 10 minutes to get in through her head that she wasn't going to get any special deals. she finally left and we had fun retelling the story to the other workers in the break room. i sincerely hope i never have to see that lady ever again.",eLlARiVeR,tfr
187,no one told me you were closed!,"this isn't as extreme as a lot of stories here (and a lot of stories i have...) but tonight, for the first time ever i locked the doors with a customer still in the store. we made a 30 minute announcement that we were closing (which we don't usually do...we usually start at 15 minutes.) then we did a 15 minute announcement. then 5 minutes. then a closed announcement. i took a walk through the store and didn't see anyone, so i locked the doors and counted off the last register. as they were balancing their drawers in the cash office, i was closing the pos program at the registers. a lady came out of nowhere with stuff in her cart about ten minutes after closing. i'll be me, customer is c, coworker is cw

me: i'm so sorry, i thought everybody was out. we've been closed for ten minutes.

c: what? nobody told me.

at this point, my co-worker intervened because i had to finish closing out and we didn't want to be there all night. 

cw: yeah, i'm sorry. that's why we make the closing announcements every five minutes, to give you time to finish up before the registers close.

c: so i can't buy my stuff???

let it be known that i work at a secondhand shop, and most of our customers are hoarders or resellers. she had maybe three things in her cart, one of which i think was a scarf. nothing life altering, like groceries or medicine.

cw: no, i'm sorry. the registers are closed.

c: but why didn't anybody tell me you were closing?

cw: because we made a bunch of announcements that we were closing and that we were closed. we didn't see you in the store.

at this point i was finished closing out of pos, apologized to her again, and went to the cash office to close up the store.

188,"""rancid cat food""","a bit of context: i work at a small grocery store doing the midnight shifts most nights. as i'm still in highschool, this can lead to me getting a bit agrivated by the end of the night for having to deal with certian people or issues. this is a case where a co-worker made me so mad i nearly quit on the spot.

on to the story. me: of course, customer: c

it was around 11:30, just half an hour before closing. of course, the guy running express hadnt done his job all night. all the grocery bags needed filled, and the lanes still needed to be swept. on top of that, my lane was full because the whole town decided the buy food at 11:30. so i'm already stressed from having too much to do, and then this guy comes over with a ton of cat stuff. here's where the story starts

me: find everything you were looking for?

c: yep, just restocking for my cats.

me: cool. do you want everything bagged?

c: except the litter, yes.

at this point i notice he had a case of 24 cans of wet cat food. he explained to me that his cats were very old so they couldnt eat solid food.

me: uh oh, looks like the case is damaged, there's a few cans that are busted. want me to grab you a new case?

c: sure

i go and get the guy a new case if cat food, having to leave my lane unattended. when i get back, i begin to notice a horrible smell wafting from the case of cat food.

me: (gagging) sorry about that, anything else tonight?

c: nope, have a good one.

after he leaves, i have to clear out my line of 5-6 more customers before calling my manager over so he could watch my lane. i then sprinted to the back room to put the cat food in damaged. i looked at the case and noticed that it had been dropped, causing the damage. turns out, whoever dropped it decided the way to fix it was to patch the hole in the package with clear tape, and leave it on the shelf, for two weeks.

there is no way they wouldnt have noticed the damage, they put the tape directly over the damaged can. not to mention the food (which was brown) was all over the indside of the package. this was an act of pure lazyness, and i was livid. i told my manager, who looked at the cameras to find the culprit. that person will receive a phone call from the owner of the store in the morning, hopefully telling him not to come back.

sorry if its a bit ranty, still very tired from last night, and i still smell of rancid cat food from having to sit next to it for 20 minutes.

tl;dr: coworker left broken cat food can on the shelf for two weeks, left me and all the customers to deal with the smell.

189,my daughter is on love and hip hop i'll take you to hawaii,"for context i work at a office supply store as a cashier. we get a lot of rude or strange customers during closing time and due to low staffing we run on 4 workers at all times. one night a man came in asking to buy a cellphone. we don't sell cellphones, we sell house phones and work phones. he says those with do and my manager points him to the phone aisle. once he walks past me i know this is gonna be a long night. he has on 3 beanies, a dirty jacket with lovely yellow jeggings, hospital socks (yellow non-slip socks) and dress shoes. no he goes to the phones and grabs the answering machine and phone pack and an extra phone and places it on my counter but he wasn't done. he grabs every item his eyes can see printer, ink, paper, headphones, bluetooth speaker everything in our store was on my register. he says he's ready to get rung up so i start scanning things and he walks away. confused as to why i scan a few more items and suspended the transaction to assist other customers. my manager tells me over the walkie talkie that he said his daughter is on love and hip hop and that he wants to take to hawaii with them and beyonce and jay z. we all have a chuckle about it and returns to the register. we repeat the cycle of ""i'm ready to be rung up oh wait lemme go get some more stuff"" and i'm annoyed. my manager is now placed next to my register to make sure this is legit (it definitely wasnt). after what felt like forever, he finally stopped and i rung everything up. totaled $800 and he wants to pay in check. as a requirement i check his id and proceed and very unsurprising ""declined check with bank"". we let him know the check was declined and to call his bank. he wants to call them but he doesn't have a phone and wants to use the store phone. store phones don't make out calls only receives calls. then wants to use our personal phones....yea no we close in 10 minutes. he looks at us like we kicked his puppy and leaves....without his id and his check. tragic. even worst i now have to put back all this garbage  that he gathered. haven't seen those yellow jeggings since.

191,"""she could've stolen 7 million dollars from me!"""," 

this is my first ever post on reddit &amp; was compelled to tell my story after a week's binge on youtube's r/ storytelling. so forgive me if i'm not as good in bringing my story across! please note that this story happened a couple years ago so it might be slightly different from how i remembered it.

i used to work as a retail staff in the attractions industry a couple years back when i was a teen. this particular story happened when i was working in the gift shop one evening. cast: cw - crazy wife, ch - crazy husband, nd - nice daughter, co - co-worker, nm - nice manager and me - me. this might be a long one so grab your popcorn &amp; let's get into it!

a little context: working in the attractions industry, it wasn't uncommon to stumble upon items guests left behind every so often. you'd be surprised at the amount of people who would dump their things all over the place to snap a picture only to get distracted, end up leaving their belongings behind and come back running in panic when they realise their items are missing.

when this happens, our staff brings the item up to the gift shop (since it is one of the first points of contact) and it is where all we have the most surveillance cameras. our standard protocol is to fill out a form (description of the item, what time we found it, where we found it etc), store the item in a discreet drawer (directly in sight of a surveillance camera) and when the owner comes to collect it, we'd have to verify that the item actually belongs to them (ie if it is a bag we'd unzip the bag and ask them to describe the items inside etc) ask them to sign the form before releasing it. i was warned that we had incidents in the past where random people would come by &amp; try to claim items that weren't theirs, hence the hassle.

this particular night, i was working the closing evening shift by myself. earlier in the day, a co-worker of mine had dropped off a backpack at the gift shop counter &amp; marked it as a lost and found item. now, keep in mind that i had only started 2 weeks ago at the time - so, i followed the company's protocol to the t. i filled out the form and tucked it safely away in the drawer and went about my day.

later in the evening, a woman (cw), came up frantically to the counter asking if we happened to find her lost backpack in the attraction. we had only found 1 backpack that day so i assumed it was hers. i proceeded with the protocol, unzipped the bag and the following conversation unfolds:

&amp;#x200b;

me: okay mam, i'm going to have to verify that this bag is yours before i release the item to you, okay?

cw: yes (clearly panicking)

me: -unzips the bag- could you describe the contents in your bag to me?

cw: um there is a towel, an umbrella -wait! i have my wallet in there, you can look for it in the bag and i can show you my id.

me: -starts searching for the wallet-

cw: have you found it??

&amp;#x200b;

this is when ch enters the picture... and all hell breaks loose.

&amp;#x200b;

ch: -sees me searching in the bag and immediately starts screaming at me- what the hell is she doing???!!

me: -looks up in shock-

ch: what the hell are you doing?? get your hands off my bag right now!!

me: -lifts my hand up (surrender style) and walks backwards away from the bag-

ch: -violently snatches the bag off the counter- what do you think you are doing, going through my bag??!!

me: -i start to panic and calls for my co-worker from another department-

ch: -walks towards the other end of the store with the bag, cursing and shouting towards the rest of his family (children included)- she was going through my f--king bag, she could've taken something! -trails off-

&amp;#x200b;

my co-worker arrives, concerned.

&amp;#x200b;

co: is everything okay? (i never ask for help unless i needed it urgently)

me: -explains everything to him and was still in completely shock-

co: don't worry you did everything according to protocol, yo-

ch: -storms back with another bag in his hang and starts screaming at co- she was going through my bag, i could have 7 million dollars in that bag &amp; she could've stolen it!!!!

co: sir, calm down.

ch: -holds the new bag up (it was obviously very heavy seeing that bottom of the canvas bag dipped &amp; was weighed down by whatever was in it)- why don't you go through this bag too??!! -literally hurls the heavy ass bag at me-

&amp;#x200b;

now is probably a good time to tell you that i am a tiny (even by asian standards) girl. i was probably 17 at the time, 4'11 tall and 99 pounds at most. the freakin' heavy bag landed on my arm (which is weaker as i had broken it before) that i had resting on the table. that. sh-t. hurt. i snapped my arm back to my body and clutched it in pain. i knelt down and started having a full-blown panic attack, i couldn't breathe &amp; couldn't stop crying. co watched in horror &amp; immediately started to comms for our manager (nm) who promptly rushed to the scene. co explained everything to nm as quickly as possible and consoled me.

&amp;#x200b;

ch: i could've had 7 million dollars in that bag and she could've stolen it all!!!

nm: -turns and yells back- you. do. not. harass my staff!!

&amp;#x200b;

i don't exactly remember what happened next because i was having a horrible panic attack but i remember hearing the following phrases: ""don't you dare f--king touch me!"", ""what are you going to do? slap me? i dare you to!"", ""call the f--king police!"", etc.

i was escorted to the bathroom by another manager to calm down and when i came back out, cw &amp; ch took their phones out and started recording us, our faces &amp; name tags, yelling about how they were going to post about this on the internet. the police arrived shortly after and ch went mental &amp; pointed at me, ""that's her! that is the girl who could've stolen money from me!"". 

&amp;#x200b;

ch: she was going through my bag without permission! (i did have permission btw)

officers: okay...?

ch: i could've had 7 million dollars in my bag!!! and she could've stolen it!!!

officers: how did she have your bag in the first place?

ch: well we lost it earlier in the day! but that's besides the point - we could have millions and she could've stolen it!

officers: well, do you have 7 million dollars in that bag?

ch: well no but -

officer: -cuts him off- please come this way sir.

&amp;#x200b;

the officers separated ch &amp; cw from nm and started interviewing them separately. they asked to review our cctv footage and the officers concluded that ch probably had anger issues and just lost his damned mind. the officers asked them to leave the premises immediately and let them off with a stern warning. they went out hollering about how they were going to sue us and complain to corporate (they never did).

it completely baffles me that cw was the one who insisted i get her wallet out to verify that the bag was hers but did a complete 180 when her husband started accusing me, immediately stood by his side and didn't bother to mention she was the one who asked me to reach into the bag in the first place. well, i hope she's not being abused by this psychopath - not to mention, his grandkids were around to witness all of this too.

till this day, i am so incredibly appreciative of that nice manager who stood up for me. more often than not, the employee gets blamed for a customer acting insane but this time around, she (and co) was my hero &amp; practically saved me from this horror story. i went on to work for the company for another year before leaving. i still see nm occasionally -she got promoted and i couldn't be happier for her. oh, and i never got into any trouble for that evening so i guess... that's a win?",freedomrosette,tfr
192,scan the coupons in a different order...,"considering it's been a while since this happened some details might be a little scuffed.  
it was around the time of black friday so not quite major sales but still cheap enough for the store to be busy enough where i had to keep cashiering for a while. everything was fine up until the point where i had a customer come up with a couple dress shirts and maybe 1 or 2 other items. this customer, he was a probably mid 30s mostly white male and he had a 3 of the coupons we had going on at the time: a $5 off special gift (something that the company sends out from time to time), a either 20 or 30% off coupon, and a $5 off $20 men's apparel coupon (or something of the like). so i get to scanning his items and the 3 coupons and it comes out to x price. the customer isn't initially satisfied with that price and asks me to scan the coupons in a different order. i comply whilst telling this customer, who was thankfully friendly, that scanning the coupons in a different order wouldn't change a thing given that the calculations for price are done server side and done in a specific order. again, it rings up the same price and he asks me to do it again, which i'm fine with because thankfully i can just delete discounts from the transaction instead of having to restart each time, and i tell him that the order won't change the price, he responds saying ""i'm just trying to convince myself."" after about a minute of this he's convinced and just pays the price that comes up and i bag the items and tell the customer to enjoy the rest of their day as i do with everyone i ring up.

193,"part of store closed due to flooding, customers can't deal with it","i work in a large department bookstore. this week, the department i work on got flooded overnight due to a pipe bursting. the day after was a mess. we have floating floorboards and when you tread on them, water was coming up from between the boards. management closed off the most badly affected part of the store with bollards and signage explaining the closure and asking customers to seek assistance from the sales staff. outsourced cleaners were in there with wet vacuums trying to clean things up and tradesmen discussing the damage with center management. we can't have customers in there with water and electrical leads everywhere.

customers were hovering beyond the barrier desperate to get into the section. we explain the situation and management's decision to close this part of the store for browsing access today, and we can bring them a particular title from the shelves back here if they want it, or we can bring them a number of books to choose from on a specific topic.

customers sad :'( customers angry &gt;:-(

""can i come in and browse?"" no you can't. that's why we have barriers here and signage explaining that you can't come in and browse.

""i just want to browse! why can't i come and look at the books? they're right there! just a few steps away!"" yes, so close, yet so far. i'm sorry.

""can you get me a sample from your x section?"" this section in question is 5 panels, numerous subsections, and thousands of books wide... the concept of a single representative title is meaningless.

""but my favourite section is in there!"" believe it or not, we did not arrange this event to inconvenience you personally... fate is arbitrary.

snapping with condescending rage: ""it doesn't look very wet."" ok... well it is very wet?

a couple of customers went behind the barrier without asking. one gentleman tried to bully my team leader into letting him in, raising his voice and puffing up his body weight over her, pushing menacingly at the bollard tape and making motions towards stepping underneath it. how can anyone get aggressive over wanting to browse in a shop?

i mean... i'm sorry, this is obviously a decision from management, i am following their directions. this is out of my control. i'm not letting you come in here. do you want me to get the managing director to come out and apologise to you? or perhaps you would like to meet our security guards and they can help you find your way to the exit?

we put a lot of hard work into our range and shelf presentation and it's nice that customers love it so much. and i get it... it's disappointing when you want something you can't have. but don't you just be like ""oh, i really wanted it! but it's ok, i can get it another time. i like browsing here so i'll be back later."" i was really surprised by the number of customers of all types who haven't achieved that level of maturity.",practicesimperfect,tfr

195,"i almost worked myself to death, but was saved by a kind old lady.","i got my job at a local grocery store in a tourist lake town a month before the height of summer. i would stock shelves and bring in carts. it was a particularly hot summer, one where the news cautioned viewers to stay indoors and to drink lots of water. surprise surprise, tourists don’t listen to the news. they were out in full force, often would leave shopping carts all over the parking lot, and would clear out the drink aisle pretty thoroughly. 

i alternated between bringing in carts and keeping drinks stocked on the shelf. i hadn’t taken my break and was getting very thirsty. we weren’t allowed to have drinks on our person, and my bosses were very strict about rules. we could be written up and sent home for an untucked shirt. if you got three strikes in one month you’d be dragged into the office and usually fired. i had two strikes: for having an untied shoelace and an untucked shirt as a manager walked by. 

i couldn’t afford the third strike so i was busting ass trying to get merchandise out on time before a manager came by. without having a drink for five hours, and being out in the sun, i began to overheat. my heart started pounding faster than it ever had and hurting like someone was squeezing it. i ignored it, and worked through it. i groaned a bit, but many customers walked by me and seemed to pay me no attention. i didn’t want any complaints from them, so i’d just take a breath or two and keep working. occasionally i would get a pulse of pain that would cause me to recoil, but i was 17 and didn’t think a stroke or heart attack was possible. i actually thought my back and ribs were just hurting from all the extra work. 

while i’m clutching my heart, after a decent amount of pain sets in, an elderly woman comes down the aisle to ask if i could help her find something. i describe the aisle she’s looking for but she’s suddenly afraid and starts asking if i’m alright. i assure her that i am, just a little tired, but my heart pulses enough to make my eyes shake and knock me to the ground. 

she immediately calls an ambulance. it isn’t too long before they show up. i refuse to be taken to the hospital, as i wanted to finish out my day and not have a third strike. the night manager, who had been called in since we were understaffed and busy, told me not to be silly. she waived my two  existing strikes, and begged the owner to install a water fountain. she and the old lady were friends, and they both didn’t leave my side until the paramedics were finished with me. since i didn’t go to the hospital, she had me call my mom to pick me up and have my sister drive my car home. i was pretty embarrassed but the paramedics said i was lucky the old lady came along.

196,why are people this way,"[insert apology for formatting because mobile here]

slight context: work for a clothing store chain that encourages people to bring old clothes to be recycled (don't ask me where, i have no idea) and in exchange will get a discount on a futire purchase.

so this woman comes in with a bag full of clothing and just dumps it on a random counter and looks at me expectantly without saying a word (i'm not so dumb as to not understand what she wanted, but i mean, maybe a greeting of some sort would have been appropriate). i put on my best ""i l o v e people"" smile and show her the box she can put her back in and go to give her the voucher she can redeem for a later purchase. she looks it over for a while, before practically shoving it in my face (if i'd been standing a centimetre closer i would have been punched in the nose) and exclaiming ""i don't have my glasses what does it say""

i take a step back because there is a hand right in my face and i know what it says on the voucher (besides, i wouldn't be able to read it from that close anyway), which she seems to find insulting because she shakes the thing in my face. still  i remain composed, keep a smile, and tell her what's on the voucher. she thanks me and leaves, and i sigh in relief until i turn to see that the bag has left dirty water all over the white counter (it was raining and apparently she put her bag on the ground at some point). i clean up and hope this is the end of it.

the next time i see her, i'm at the till, ringing up customers. 

picture this: a row of four tills, only number four is currently open, and customers are all lining up at that till. where better to wait for it to be your turn, then right at till number two?

so while i'm dealing with the customers who have an ounce of common sense, i see her getting impatient from the corner of my eye. finally realising that i am not  going to drop everything, close my till, ignore four people, and come tend to her dumb ass (the nerve of retail employees these days) she decides to join the queue. when it's her turn, i slap on an even bigger smile than i already had and ask her whether she found everything. she ignores me. slaps the voucher on the counter. i ask her whether she needs a bag for 30cts. ""not if i have to pay for it, she scoffs. i don't let it get me down. i will remain friendly if it kills me.

i ring her up and wish her an excellent afternoon. was i expecting a ""thank you, you too?"" at this point, honestly, no. but instead of just leaving she examines the receipt for two whole minutes right in front of me (bitch you bought two items). finally she leaves, and i see her head to the tablets we have for customers to give us feedback.

she only tapped the screen twice and seemed to give up (she didn't have her glasses after all) so i'm hoping she just didn't have the patience to go through with whatever she was planning on doing, because i really don't want my store to get a negative feedback from someone i treated with way more respect than they deserved.

197,manger faints customer are upset.,"on mobile and all that yada

i worked in a grocery store that was scheduled to close in about an hour while on register my manger went in the back to get water and my co worker was working on the shelves. so it’s co - co worker, me- me c- customer, sm- store manger.

my co worker went in the back five minutes later and calls me.

co- hey me, m is on the ground unresponsive.

me- okay give me one second, tells customer i’ll be right back.

i run into the break room, and my manger is on the ground barley responsive and seems out of it.

me- co call 911, i’ll call the sm so she can come in (we can’t close on our own since we have to have a manger do the count the registers,) as i run back up front i have a long line and customer staring impatiently. 

c- why are you taking so long?

me- we have a medical emergency so i’ll do my best to get you out as soon as possible, (i rush through about 10 customers just trying to clear out the store.

cw- hey the ambulance needs you to go stand outside, i don’t want to leave m. 

me- okay, i apologize to the customers, letting them know i’ll be right back. and wave to the ambulance and guide the paramedics to my manger who’s been on the ground and finally waking up.

c- are you gonna help us or what. ( i was walking past to let the paramedics into the room he was in) and said i’ll be right there. 

my store manger finally came in and locked the doors (an hour earlier then usual)  and told me to finish ringing people up. 

c- you guys should’ve really told the ambulance to move so it’ll be easier to get into the store. (she’s glaring at me like it’s my fault he parked there) 

me- i’m sorry about that ma’am but we had an emergency and needed the paramedics right away. 

c- doesn’t excuse the ambulance blocking the entrance. (the ambulance has the lights on and is blocking both doors for people coming in and out, so getting into the store was quite difficult.) 

me- well have a good day ma’am (as i finish ringing her order and sent her out of the store) 

my store manger then came walking out with the paramedics and my m on the gurney being wheeled out. looks at me like wtf happen.

me- hey cw is he okay? what the paramedics say? 

cw - not to much just said he needs to go to the hospital. 

sm- hey me, i honestly wasn’t going to answer your phone call but it was late so i thought it was weird. 

me- we’ll thankfully you did.

we finished closing and left about 20 minutes late because me and my co worker were still understanding what happen. my manger was out a week with being diagnosed with heart issues and couldn’t return to work until he was better. thankfully he was okay but still a nightmare night.

200,"guy tried to pump gas at closing time, then complained about me not letting him","so, this is my first time on reddit, english is not my first language an i'm on mobile.

i work at a gas station while going to college to earn some extra money. this gas station is located in germany, btw., so here you first pump your gas, them go inside the shop and pay for it. we're open until 11 o'clock in the evening and have this rule my boss set up, that no the gasoline pumps on the outside must be locked at 22:56/22:57, so no customer will be in the shop after 11 o'clock, because our insurance will not cover any damages after our closing time. 
it's a good rule i think, because not only it helps us employees with our closing routine in the evening (we're alone on our shifts and have to get everything done alone), also not many people are able to pump their gas and pay withing 3 minutes.

anyway, one evening, ist was 22:56/57, so i closed the pumps. after that, i have to lock the front entrance, which is made of two glass sliding doors. annoyed client (ac) comes to the door, sees me kneeling behind it to fiddle with my key to close it (the lock ist right above the ground) and stops a few feet away.

ac: ""hey, it's not time for you to close! why can't i pump anymore gas?"" he makes a movement with his fingers, tapping an imaginary watch on his wrist. (ugh. he knows better how to do my job than i do.)

me: ""i'm sorry, i can'l let you pump gas anymore, we have a rule that no one can pump gas after 22:57. we're closed now.""
(this guy was none of our regulars, i didn't see him before, most of our clients unterstand this an will leave right away. oh but not this guy.)

ac: ""what?"" (he still is standing a few feet away from the door. it's hard to talk through security-glass and he could have just come closer.)

me: *looking at the locked door* *looking at him* *wondering if he expects me to stick my head through the closed glass door to talk to hin so he doesn't have to come closer*

ac realised his mistake, came closer

me: *explained everything again, telling him several times that it's also our bosses rule and even told him why we do this*

he finally left. 

within the next days he stopped by again, this time at daytime. he told my colleague that i had closed like fifteen minutes before closing time and how he was not able to pump his gas because of this and how this was so wrong of me and how this can not be and that he wants to talk to my boss and yadda yadda. she instantly did not believe him because she also knows our rule and knows me. she told him to come back in the afternoon if he wanted to talk to the boss. he said he would, but he never did. 
even if he would have talked to him - everything was captured by our cameras. it would have easily been exposed that he was lying.

so this was my first little story, i hope you enjoied it a little. i feel better now writing this down. it happened a few weeks ago but i still feel anger thinking about how rude this guy was.

there are two ways of accessing your membership: entering your phone number and its 4 digit pin or through the app.

i was on a regular lane this day and it was a slow day, i would get about 1 customer every 2 or 3 minutes. in walks crazy lady (cl). she seemed like a sweet lady, i greeted her and she smiled back and returned the greeting. she wasn't buying much so i rung them up in about 2 minutes. as i was scanning, she was staring hard at the screen that lists the items and their prices and this is how the rest went:

&amp;#x200b;

cl: so are these (insert random produce item) 3 for $5?

me: yes. do you have your savings membership

cl: i think so, how do i enter it

i point to a button on the card reader screen and tell her ""just press this and enter your phone number and the 4 digit pin .""

i continue scanning her items and every few items i scan, my screen tells me that the number she enters is unknown. after the 3 attempt, she couldn't enter the number anymore.

me: ma'm you reached the maximum attempts-

cl: what's my number? can't you enter it?

i was visibly confused: ""um, i can't enter it on my screen for your privacy.""

she groans loudly while rolling her eyes.

cl: gosh i can't even remember my phone number and you can't help me! you must hate me! god must hate me for having me go through this! it's such a terrible day. just let me pay.

i was just staring as she whined and tried to think about what to do but she was grabbing her bags from the bagging area with a visibly angry posture and slams her items in her cart. i finish the order and give her the receipt and tell her to have a great day. she glances at me before storming out.

so for a quick summary of how i met the old guy that i'm going to be talking about. he is an old guy (pretty obvious i know) and i was working self-checkout and he came up to me asking ""where do you guys have your lights?"" in all honesty i didn't exactly know we moved most things around since our store was under remodel but i was sure they were by the aisle that had school/office supplies so i replied back ""i can't leave here to show you but they are over by the office supplies in the next section behind the wall"" (they were there in the end). he goes off and not even a minute later tells me ""they are not there"" and since i had self-checkout to watch i just grab my supervisor and tell them what he was looking for and in less than a minute they went where they were and picked him up. my supervisor being amazing tells me that he wants me fired since ""i should know the whole store"" i wasn't blown back really i just thought it was just some grumpy guy, whatever. he fiddles with the machine and then buys the singular light bulb i say ""have a great night"" since i just say it to everyone as they leaves just to be nice. he comes up to me and claims that if it ever happens again i should be fired and because i wasn't in the mood and wanting to be polite as possible i just say ""certainly sir, yep, totally agree"" and that was the last time i thought i will have to deal with him.

oh boy would i be wrong

old man 2: electric boogaloo

a month or so later.... yep. on self-checkout as well. yesterday of me writing this

so i was doing my normal rounds asking guests if they need bags and generally helping them. enter stage left: old man. i didn't recognize him and he was taking awhile on the checkout so of course i go and help him and say ""have you scanned the item yet?"" 99% of the time i ask this to anyone else having issues with the machine i get the usual reply of ""i'm trying to figure it out"" or ""i'm just checking if i want the item"" and them i help them as needed but this old guy oh boy was it a mistake to even to helping him* (trust me this will come in handy later). 
i almost instantaneously get assaulted with him strangely asking my age i say i'm 19 he then goes on then says that ""you should not harass the damn customers"" ""only help when you are asked to help"" (* yes this guy believes people should only need help if and only if they ask obviously he never worked in retail) ""back off!"" most guests where actually surprised by him and started chuckling at him. i not really caring that much if some old guy refuses my help i back off as instructed. i go around and help other guests as i do and he struggles on how you have to press cash on the screen to put in cash. he never asked for my help so i didn't help him as requested i'm not that pity to say ""oh you have to touch the screen, ect, ect.."" and me thinking that was it and just as the first time i tell him ""have a great day!"" and like if it was repeating history then comes up to me to try to chew me out starting with ""have they trained you at all since last time!?"" my mind started to fully click everything into place to realize this was the same old guy. i respond of course surprised still mid-process ""trained?"" he just repeats more or less the same back and then i said ""i've been trained just to help guests as needed it looked like you-"" he didn't like my guest service answer then said something around the lines ""you have no idea how much you are harassing people like me"" and me basically done with his crap just replied ""you are the one harassing me aren't you? you are then one being aggressive towards me"" i realize i should just point him to my supervisor so i do he just yells at my supervisor who is in the middle of helping a guest and my supervisor barely gets anything that he says. he leaves after saying his rant which i unfortunately just couldn't hear i was happily back to helping other guests.

epilouge:

just like that he was gone. everyone continues to how they were and soon later my supervisor comes up and asks ""what was up with the guest just now?"" i tell him the truth and what i said to him and what he said to me ""he was harassing me and told him he was. ""my supervisor really understanding says yeah some guests are just wanting to be grumpy and i tell him"" yep i don't really care he just was just having overreaction. ""my supervisor again agrees and asks me ""did you know him"" i reply with a short ""nope"" and again things went back to normal. 

all i can really say is to people who do this: just don't

tl;dr: old guy wanted me fired over not finding lights bulbs a month later harasses me again. he leaves.

i'll keep any updates if any more events happen.

208,why is it wet?,"one day, when working the closing shift a lady comes up to the fitting rooms were the stores phone operater and i were having a chat. at the store i work at the operater also runs the fitting room and i would take it's clothing guest wouldn't want and put them back on to the sales floor.

this lady had a few bathing suits in her hands that she wanted to try on, we gave her the ""okay"" and went back to are conversation ((it was a slow day and the managers were busy in the other departments)). 5 minutes later the lady is asking for help, the phone rang and my operater gave me a smug grin.

me: me
lady: lady
phone operater: po

me: is everything alright?

lady: this size is to small can you replace it with a size up?

me: sure thing!

lady: *slams door open and is fully naked, she then throws the bathing suit at me*

me: ... *screaming inside because the suit she throw at me was also wet* 

i made my way to po and set the bathing suit down. po grabs it and then drops it looking at me with horror.

po: what the fuck

me: i don't know, i need a shower and bleach.

po: what the fuckkkk

me: i refuse to go back there and help again

po: mmmmmnnmmmmm

i left to wash my hands in the bathroom and take my 15 minute break, after what i touch and saw i was pretty much done for the day.

i got back and saw the same face of horror on po face.

me: you didn't

po: *points to bathing suits she tried on* there all gross and wet and she flashed me when she opened the door, oh and guess what she as a husband who looked at me with pride like i should be jealous of that.

me: i'm so sorry

po: this isn't the worst thing that's happened in the fitting rooms but it sure is scaring.

after that i made sure to call someone else to help guest in the fitting rooms and to never touch bathing suit from the fitting rooms.

209,can i see your id?,"so during college, i worked for the same retail chain on and off for 5 years. i had a lot of memorable experiences, but the one that stuck with me the most is below. 

before i get to the story, a little explanation about me. i have always been super strict when it comes to rules, and often take precautions i shouldn't. as most can imagine from the title, this includes asking *everyone* for id when it comes to alcohol. i was always paranoid i would fail a sting, so i just decided i would check the id of the buyer and *every person who touched the alcohol* so i knew i'd never get in trouble. or so i thought.

so the day in question i was working my register, getting people through pretty quickly, minding my own business. about halfway through my shift, an older lady and a college age guy came through. the lady was paying, but it was the college age dude who put the alcohol on the belt. i did my best to politely ask for both of their ids, and neither of them had anything. i found that really suspicious, so i denied the sale. as i'm putting the alcohol off to the side, i hear a snide remark from the next customer in line.

&gt;seriously? she's obviously old enough to buy it. that's stupid.

immediately my retail senses were tingling that this was a moment i was going to hate, and i glanced back to the woman who made the comment. she looked mid to late twenties, had a teenager with her, and to my horror i watched as the teenager slowly put a bottle of hypnotic on the conveyor belt. 

*fuck my life.*

 i start scanning the woman's items, and finally reach the bottle of alcohol and begin the worst three minutes of my retail experience.

&gt;me: can i see both of your ids?

&gt;her: she's obviously not old enough to buy it. why the hell do you need to see it?

&gt;me: i'm sorry. can i see both.

&gt;her: oh for god's sake. *hands me both ids* this is my daughter.

i check both ids. the adult is 23, obviously old enough to buy the alcohol, but the ""daughter"" is 15. i check the last names (what i usually did in this situation), and they didn't match, so i called for my immediate supervisor for a second opinion. i tell the lady one sec, and we wait for maybe 10 seconds for my supervisor before she got annoyed.

&gt;her: i don't see what the big deal is. it's just alcohol, i'm old enough to buy it, this is ridiculous, why are we waiting for this other person?

in that moment, i don't know if it was nerves, frustration, or just my brain ceasing to function, but i said the single stupidest thing i could have in that situation.

&gt; me: ma'am, if this is your daughter, that would mean you would have to have been 8 when you had her.

and it was that moment i understood what it meant to have truly fucked up.

&gt;her: she's my step-daughter! are you fucking kidding me?! this is absolutely absurd! this is un-fucking-believable! i want to speak to your manager!

at about that point, all of the color had left my face and i looked away praying for some sort of back-up. instead, i see my supervisor with a look of ""what the hell did you do?"" slowly walking over. i told my manager what was going on, she looked at the ids, and she asked me the only important question in that moment.

&gt; do you decline the sale?

without thinking, i said ""yes"" and my manager took over from there. she informed the woman that the alcohol sale was declined, and the woman slammed her cart into the wall in front of her and walked out. immediately my manager shut off my light, and i asked if i was in trouble.

&gt; manager: nope. it was your call. i just figured you might need a moment after that.

for the next three years, any time this woman saw me, she would make snide comments behind my back, and make sure she was loud enough for me to hear it.

&gt;stay close to me, i wasn't old enough to have you.
&gt;careful, you might not be my daughter.

hindsight on the situation, i should have just sold her the damned booze and just left it at that. it was just one of those retail moments that stuck with me for the longest time.

210,no pleasing this customer,"i will try to keep it short. first time posting

i used to be a manager at a grocery store that on weekends had non profit groups hold bbqs outside of the store. we supplied the product (buns, burgers, condiments) and the more the group sold, the more profit they made at no cost to them. each burger cost $3.00 each which is important for the story.

one afternoon, the non pleasing customer (i will call him npc) comes into the store to speak to a manager. i come to the service desk to greet npc and ask how can i help

npc:"" why do you charge $6.00 for a double burger when the group further down sells the for $5.00?""(one of the other businesses in our box store complex also has bbqs)( the other group is about 200 feet away)

me: the group over there has the same group doing daily bbqs and have no problem making a little less money whereas our group is only here for one day. 

npc: then why would i buy one from this group?

me: that is totally up to you sir. you have the choice to buy a burger from wherever you want.

npc: then i want to buy a double burger from this stand but i'm only paying $5.00.

me: sorry sir, but our prices are $6.00 for a double. this us for charity and they would like to make a profit. if you want to walk to the other group, you can get a cheaper burger.

npc: i dont want to walk over there. i want one from here for $5.00. ( this went back and forth for quite a while. this was also inside the store with the customer getting louder and angrier. he could have walked to the other place 4 or 5 times to get a cheaper burger but i'm guessing he just wanted someone to argue with)

me: (fed up at this time) sir, come with me.
i proceeded to the charity group, gave them $6.00 out of my own pocket, and asked them to make the gentleman a double burger on me.

npc: that's not what i wanted you to do. i just wanted a double burger for $5.00

i cut him off at the that and told him to ""have a nice day, and you are welcome for the free burger"".  i was extremely frustrated by this point and had to get back to work. 

it didnt end there as i had staff and customers later tell me about an angry customer complaining that i bought him a burger.

211,sharing is the greatest power of all,"after five years in theme park customer service and four years in retail, i've lost track of most of the horribly bad. so i thought i'd share a good moment that really stuck with me. 

i was working at a well known kid's store where the employees help the customers create their product. i would even go so far as to say build their product. one of the most popular options was to make your item superhero themed. one day, i had a boy who was about 3 years old choose to do the superhero theme. he was talkative, his parents didn't have to push him to say anything. i was really excited to help him because of this. 

when i interacted with customers, i tried to theme the conversations to the item they were making. it was just a good business plan for reinforcing their purchase. the boy jumped right into the conversation with me. m for me, b for boy.

&amp;#x200b;

m: are you so excited for your new toy!

b: it's gonna be so much fun!

m: well you know, only superheroes can take this home. what's your superpower?

b: one time we were looking for eggs and i had two, but my friend didn't have any, so i gave him one. 

m: that's one of the best superpowers i've ever heard about!

b: it is?

212,"""why do you need my pin number?!""","i just recently came across this sub and have been reading some of your stories, and i happened to remember that i have some stories (plural) of my own to share. so here goes!

so i work in a well known grocery store in the uk (17 y/o male by-the-by). this store is known for being rather middle class-y as stores go. you don't get much of the weird whacky people that visit corner stores and the like.
i've been working there 4 months and this happened i wanna say 2-4 weeks ago.

it was getting towards the end of my shift, one hour to go exactly, when a woman joined the line (which was about 6 people long), she looked to be quite old but i'm not sure if she was quite a pensioner. either way, i will now refer to her as sl (strange lady).

i serve the customers without a hitch, business as usual. sl eventually reaches the front of the line. i noticed at the time that she had shopping bags from other stores with her, meaning she had done most of her days shopping before coming here. this will be important later.

i started serving sl, everything goes as normal, until we get to the transaction stage.

sl chooses to pay with card and insert it into the machine. again, nothing unusual about this. but you can imagine how confused i am when she asks me why she needs to input her pin number!

""why do you need that? no, you're not having it""

at this point i'm so stunned i can't even respond, i couldn't even ask sl why. after staring at her for a few seconds in bewilderment, i tried to explain why she needed to enter her pin, however i fell flat to persuade her.

all this is going on in full view of the now 7 people in the line, and at least another one hundred people in that part of the store, which may i also add is in the center of my city.

after i failed to persuade sl, the customer standing behind her decided to lend me a helping hand, and joined in trying to change her mind. i don't know what she did differently, as she spoke quietly as to not draw more attention, but whatever it was, it worked.

finally sl put her pin number in and the machine started working on the transaction. now these card readers aren't the fastest thing in the world, they take a few seconds if you're paying by inserting your card and not contactless. she grows impatient barely two seconds after pressing enter on her pin.

""has it done it yet?!""

i don't answer for a few seconds, allowing the machine to finish before then thanking her as i do after serving everything customer. sl withdrew her card from the reader and grabbed her stuff and started packing it, in front of everyone. it took what felt like years. usually in this circumstamce people would move their stuff further away from the cashier so i can at least start serving the next person, but no, she stood right there, blocking me from moving on, also insulting my ability to do my job while packing her things.

eventually, though, sl was finally ready and waddled off. the next customer giving me an 'i really feel your pain' look. thank god that was over, my nerves were in shreds having to live out this whole thing in front of many other people with paranoia and anxiety biting at my heels the whole time, in case i slipped up and showed cracks while dealing with her. and unfortunately for me this would not be the last time i would encounter her.

the next encounter would be too long to fit in this post down here, so if you want me to write up the sequel then let me know.

213,"she didn't believe me, so she asked someone else.","i have way better stories than this one, this was just the shortest one i could think of at the moment.

so i used to work at a local retail/grocery store that only allows members to shop there(yeah. one of those two stores) and for those who do not know, they only carry certain items around the holidays and various other times throughout the year so the store is constantly changing. now keep in mind, when this interaction happened i had already been working here for almost 3 years so at this point i know this place like the back of my hand. 

&amp;#x200b;

so on this particular day i was just doing my daily tasks: zoning, stocking the run, helping members, etc., when a member walks up to me and asks where we keep our french's fried onions. i then tell her that we only carry that item around thanksgiving because the store carries everything in bulk, therefore the merchandise takes up a lot of space so they can't carry everthing year round. 

&amp;#x200b;

i guess she didn't understand or didn't like what i said so she gets a little pissy and asks again. rl=rude lady, cw1=produce coworker, cw2=grocery coworker, me=me lol.

rl: no seriously. where are the fried onions?

me: we don't have them right now. we only carry them around thanksgiving.

rl: well you obviously don't know what you're doing. i'll just find someone else then.

she then proceeds to walk over to cw1 and asks him where they are. now since it's such a big store, not every associate knows where everything is so cw1 gets on his walkie.

cw1: hey groceries, do we have any of the french's fried onions?

because the aisles are so wide i can clearly see cw1 and rl from where i'm standing so i reply.

me: no, i already told the member we don't carry them right now. 

so i figure that the situation is dealt with and i can continue with my work. nope. not even close. what do i see out of the corner of my eye? cw1 and rl walking towards me to ask me again. when rl finally realizes that they were walking towards me, she says ""oh not her. she doesn't know anything."" which kind of shocks cw1 a little because just like the majority of the people that work there, he knows that i'm the go-to person to find almost anything in the store. so they proceed to walk through the freezer section and find cw2 zoning and ask him where they are. luckily cw2 has been working here a little while longer than i have so he knows the store just as well as i do. he then tells cw1 and rl the exact same thing that i said. 

overall, the rl ended up wasting her time talking to 3 people to find one thing when she could've just gone to the store next to us and get it.

214,"woman gets upset over being asked to pay for her 15c bag, i get cussed at for it","crossposted on r/retailhell because it fits there too. also i'm sorry if its a little long. this happened a couple days ago. title is self explanatory.

so some context, one of my jobs is in a large chain supemarket. i mainly work in the self serve kiosk or on large registers. for this particular encounter, i was in self serve on a fairly busy day. 

so, i've been on for about an hour, greeting everyone that comes in (a job requirement, as is interacting with the customers more than once to help prevent theft - this is important for later). in walks this woman and her daughter (nice kid as far as i can tell, though quiet). this woman is a regular on mondays and to this point is someone who has been friendly so i generally give her a big smile and a quiet hello (she was on the phone so i was trying not to interupt her too much). they had 2 items and a 15 cent plastic bag. when she returns her basket i get a look at her register and notice the bag has not been scanned and looks previously unused so i decided to double check (ok yes it is only 15c but due to being considered stock it is infact theft if they dont pay for it so if they dont i get in trouble).

now i know shes on the phone, so i pitch my voice lower and politely ask (still smiling) if the bag is new. she doesn't seem to mind as i am keeping my voice low and sentences short. conversation goes something like this,

me: hi there! is your bag new today?

woman: yes it is we picked it up on the way in (should point out she was actually smiling at me still)

me (as politely as possible): ok, i just need to quickly remind you that it needs to be scanne---

oh boy. usually the reaction i get is along the lines of 'oh s*** i totally forgot sorry'. but no, my sentence wasn't even finished when this woman does a complete personality 180.

woman: excuse me, im on the phone right now! you're just gonna have to wait!

im not a confrontational person, i can and have gotten teary over arguments, especially when im mad so i backed off said ok and stepped away from her. 

the next thing i know she is ranting to whoever she is on the phone with then turns on the daughter, tells (yells at) her to 'scan the bag!' and then continues to rant into the phone. 

now, i couldn't make out the majority of it, but the bits i did hear included them apparently agreeing that all the girls in my store were the 'worst' and that i was apparently getting all uptight over '15 f****** cents' (the lady next to gave ger a dirty look,  then gave me the 'wtf is her problem' face but otherwise stayed out of it).

i decide to do a round of the machines to check if anyone needed help etc. thinking i would give her a chance to cool off but i made it back to where i had been previously standing before she left. while i was not happy with her behaviour i still gave her a small smile and nod as i do with all customers who are leaving the kiosk. her response? to walk as close as she could behind me and loudly call me a bitch. she then proceeded to glare at me for another 30 seconds just to try and goad me into reacting so she could complain about me to my supervisors. needless to say i kept my mouth shut and she eventually stormed off when she realised i wasn't going to give her that satisfaction. 

i told my supervisors, and they thought the encounter was hilarious but way over the line on her part. i doubt they will even bother speaking to me if any complaints come through online (customers can complain or give feedback anon online).

that woman aint ever getting smiles from me again. the kid will though, can't imagine growing up with that s***.

215,"no, i don't want sunglasses!","hello! this is a story about my time working for a small sunglasses stand. i was about 15-16 at the time, and i was about a managing level (family), however, the girls were encouraged to stand at the front and smile wide. that meant we dealt with most of the customer service and pricing deals. one day, this man approached me at the stand when my uncle had left, and conversation ensued as follows (we'll call him philip or p): 

philip: ""hey. i'm not here for the sunglasses."" 

me: ""alright, sir. is there something i can help find, then? i'm happy to."" 
(the stand was in a local fair and people often asked for help.) 

p: ""no, do you live around *city we were in*? you look like it.""

me: ""yes, i'm a local. i can leave you to look around, sir."" 

p: ""i am too. i'm not here for the sunglasses. you look pretty."" 

at this point, i walk away and pretend to help other people looking near, because i didn't want to deal with whatever that might have escalated to. he was still wandering around the stand about ten minutes afterwards, therefore i tried my best to maintain customer service and try it again. (everyone was still off on their break.) i was extremely anxious over this, because this man looked old enough to be my father (fanny pack and all)

me: ""sir, are you certain i can't help you?"" 

p: ""i don't want sunglasses. when are you on break?"" 

me: ""i don't take breaks. i'm sorry, sir."" (i worked 14-15 hour shifts.) 

at around this time my uncle arrived back, and he does not play with me. this wasn't exactly the first time adult men came around to talk with me, and proceed to buy nothing, or walk around/ by the stand to stare at me. his patience was worn very thin by the end of the annual week of sales, so he immediately told him he better disappear and not show up again. the man was disagreeable, but once another man appeared, he left. 

i don't know why people show up and expect me to tell personal info, especially when i'm attempting to work and paid to be nice to these men ( a tip, most retail employees are paid to be nice. they aren't interested.) it wasn't insane story like others, or maybe it wasn't extremely weird, however i felt it's worth mentioning, because i felt unsafe/ weirded out. who goes somewhere and doesn't buy anything? 

sorry about format, and tl;dr: a man shows not wanting sunglasses, asks me about personal information, and gets kicked from my stand. ",incredicali,tfr
216,complaining shoplifter,"i run a store that sells a mix of pop culture and adult items, as well as a lot of cheesy gag stuff (if you know what i mean...)

having the adult items tends to attract the idiots who think it's perfectly okay to take what they want, because why not? this last weekend, i was doing my required closing shift, and it was a relatively quiet night. this couple comes in, a young guy and his girlfriend. i've seen them in the store before, and as far as i'd noticed, they were pretty mellow and okay. turns out i was wrong...

i went into the back room to get something, the door to which is in the middle of the adult section. something i'd overheard from the couple twigged my spidey-sense, so i stood at the door for a moment, listening. sure enough, the guy was talking the girl into slipping a toy up her sleeve. we'd never know!

i sat down to watch the cameras, because yes, i have two cameras on that section alone. i watched her pick out her toy (the appropriately-named ""wallbanger"") and they started wandering the store with it. i went back out to the floor, and kept them in sight. at one point, some kids knocked some items off of a display, and they helped me clean it up. then they wandered back to the opposite corner of the store, and sure enough, the toy went up her sleeve.

i went back to the front of the store, and as they were walking out the door, i stopped them.

""hey, where did you put that toy you picked out?""

""i put it back.""

""actually, i've been watching you, and you haven't been back to that corner since you picked it off the wall. can you show me where you left it, please?""

she walked in, the boyfriend trailing behind us both. i give him credit for not bailing out and leaving her behind, at least. as she walked through the store, i could see her trying to discreetly slip the box out of her sleeve. she got it out just as she got to the other corner, and handed me an opened box. the wallbanger was still in the box, thankfully.

""great. thanks for that. by the way...you and your boyfriend are now banned from the store. i don't want to see you here again.""

""what? why?""

""i watched you put the toy up your sleeve, you left the store with it. i could have you arrested for shoplifting. be glad i'm just banning you and your boyfriend. now please leave.""

i followed them to the door, and as they walked out, i spoke one more time.

""by the way, the next time you decide to try to steal from a store? don't talk about it in the store.""

they both paled, then turned and walked away.

not the end.

the next morning, i'm opening, and the phone rings. i'm not fully awake, and i don't answer the phone with my name like i normally do. the voice on the other end asks for a manager, which wakes me up. i identify myself, and the girl launches into a complaint about the guy who accused her of putting a sex toy up her sleeve and banned her from the store for no reason the night before.

""yeah...that was me. i was the manager last night. you're still banned.""

five seconds of complete silence, then a soft click as she disconnected the call.

217,the tale of the yellow bandit,"the day was a sunday, and i was **not** enjoying this shift. the seasonal flip flops had arrived, and it was time to set the sections, but for some reason the last person who set this pegged seasonal section used a mismash of peg types from 4sd all the way to 16hd. i asked myself the age old question, ""*who did that?*"" i took anything that was not a 10sd off the peg wall and dropped them into a shopping basket and started off to the receiving area.

&amp;#x200b;

now, it is important to note my receiving room's door stays propped open, because previous employees of this store have absolutely destroyed it and up to this point my work orders to have it fixed have been kicked back. this has already made me feel a little weird because all of my other stores i've had locks installed on the receiving room's door so not even vendors could be back there without an employee handing them the key. having been here a year almost though, i finally have settled down and no longer have issues with being startled because i fly into the back to find a vendor back there.

&amp;#x200b;

so, i go wheeling speedily into the back with my shopping cart with a roaring caster sounding like something out of mad max. i get a little playful at work some times, drift said shopping cart around the corners. i drift it, as one does, into the back pointed down the way i need to go to put the pegs up. i caught a glimpse of someone out the corner of my eye, and at first assume vendor until my mind clicked, ""*it's sunday! best day of the week in my opinion...do you know why that is, dudley? no vendors? right you are dear boy, no vendors on sunday!""*

i spun on heel to see a large man starting to find his way out of the front corner of my receiving area, and for once in my life find the mess at the front to be a useful thing for slowing him down. ""**excuse me**,"" i snapped. ""can i help you?""

&amp;#x200b;

""lookin' for the bathroom,"" he muttered as he rounded the corner out of the receiving area. of course i took this as a lie, because when you see some rando customer in the corner of your receiving area in a mound of stock, you assume they're back there to steal.

&amp;#x200b;

""it's out of order,"" i called back firmly as i stepped towards the corner to inspect it and see the packaging i assumed he'd dropped when i wheeled in. and behold...thereupon the floor was a bright yellow puddle, running into the wall, soaking its way into the corner of products.

&amp;#x200b;

at this moment, i could feel a wave of heat rising from the fiery depths of hell transforming me from the humble italian retailer mario into the goddamn king koopa bowser. i stormed up to the front of the store, knowing i would catch him...but alas, wario knew well what he was doing. i reached the door by the time he left the parking lot in a silver sedan. when i stepped back into the door, my cashier looked at me and asked, ""what's wrong, /u/admiralda?""

&amp;#x200b;

""that motherfucker just cocked his leg and pissed like a dog in the back room!"" i said, before i came back down off the heat and realized i was in a professional setting. you could have dropped a pin, and someone on the other side of the sales floor would have heard it. the yellow bandit has yet to be caught and charged for indecent exposure and destruction of property.",AdmiralDA,tfr
218,customer doesn't understand discount,"something im sure most people are familiar with is the customer facing screen. it displays the items, sometomes the price of each item, and then the tax and total. in my 5 years of working various retail jobs ive never had someone get confused with what the displayed price was. 

so, the customer ordered 2 items and wanted to use a coupon on one of the items, however our computers will automatically pick the best deal. in this case those 2 items purchased together where a few dollars cheaper than what his coupon would give him and you cant use both. the customer was confused by this so i explained the combo and how his coupon could be used another day. he still was very confused so i explained it in a different way but he wanted to do it his way, which i couldn't do even if i wanted to. the computer automatically applies the best discount and you cant make it more expensive. he then goes on a tirade about how there are 3 totals on the screen and how this makes no sense. i just tell him in not sure how else to explain it and that this is cheaper. he out of nowhere tells me that saying ""this"" makes no sense (in context it really does). then decides to say f#ck it, and asks for my name and says ""name, you're an a##hole"" then walks over to tell my manager that im an a##hole and walks out.

im completely dumbfounded as to 1. how im the a##hole and 2. how a cheaper option is bad.

please listen to the cashier, we know what we are talking about and trust me most of us have no incentives to intentionally make things more expensive.

219,man is unsure of prices and is afraid of russian oligarchs stealing his data,"so i work at generic american retail store and after i take my lunch break that's when the crazy's come out. so i;m just doing my thing stocking shelves when this older dude walks over and starts comparing prices when he says to me""hey how much is this?"" as he points to some juice"" i look at the tag and say ""sir that is 2.98."" thinking that was the end of our interaction. he retorts with""the name brand is only 2,78 why would i pay 20 cents more for a generic. i had thought that i made a mistake and that he had grabbed juice cocktail(juice and water) instead of 100 percent juice so i said the juice cocktail price of 1,98. this made him happier so he started complaining to me about how they had removed a scanner device one of the isles. i remarked that we also used it a lot and that we where a little annoyed it was gone. he then tells me to inform my manager of the situation and i thought this was just gonna be a normal interaction, but i was sorely mistaken. he then starts complaining that the company doesn't respect costumer feedback and started ranting about the stores app for scanning the prices yourself. he starts ranting about how data is being stored and sold and that mark zuckerberg and putin where in cahoots to steal this mans precious data(the app requires an email and a password to register) and eventually  after about 2 minutes realizes that hes being a lunatic and that i don't care and he leaves. i realize i made a mistake and told him the wrong price for the juice so i ask my manager about the dude and she informs me that he regularly comes in just to harass people about the scanner being removed i tell her about the mistake in the prices and his rant about facebook and putin teaming up to steal his information and we have a good chuckle and she tells me that she'll give him the juice for a dollar and if i see him to tell him.

220,how can you be out of fuel?,"so heres 2 stories for you.  


1) so a i work at a convience store in se texas. it was around hurricane season, a little bit after hurricane harvy, and we were very busy because of the need for people to rush in and fill up there cars and spare tanks for generators since we were one of the few stores still open  and barely keeping up in fuel sells since almost all the factories had shut down due to the major flooding. obviously our tanks were dangerously low and it was only a matter of time before we ran out again.  
needless to say we eventually ran out of unleaded in the middle of the day and i had to start turning down customers and explaining that we had just ran out while we tried to get someone out there to tag the pumps. ((we cant really tell exactly when until our pumps start refusing to pump at about 500g left))  
but because this is retail and we all have that customer this middle to late age woman came in and i obviously had to turn her down. and that is were her anger suddenly exploded.  
she starts by pulling the race card and accusing me of refusing to sell to her because of it, i apologized and told her that we have litterly just ran out right as she pulled in.  
she followed this up with proof claiming her neighbors had just gotten fuel a couple hours ago. once again i apologized and stated a few hours ago we had fuel but we ran out. but she wasn't having it. she demanded i print a piece of paper and write her a note stating ""i refused service to the customer because we are out of fuel"" and sign it with my full name.  
by this point my manager noticed the berate woman and took over and eventually shooed the woman out the door with sarcastic politeness thats above my pay-grade.   


then story number 2 much shorter. a few days later same scenario. fuel trucks cant keep up with fuel sales. a couple of ladies. middle age mom and late teenage daughter. came to buy fuel. had to explain taht we were out of unleaded,so all we had was premium. and she looked at me and stated "" why would you order premium if you cant even keep enough unleaded"" -as a note. usually we have i think 8k gallons of premium and 25k gallons of unleaded. and all factories still closed and our fuel sells were up by 4x at least-  
this lady at least didnt argue. instead she walked out the door. i stated ""have a great day"" and she gave me the bird and told me to f-off",Ordosan,tfr
221,worm man,"i used to work at a popular retail chain in the desert part of texas. i was there for about a year and a half, worked across 10 different departments even though i was only hired to take care of 2, and met probably tens of thousands of people. 

no one has perplexed me more than worm man.

i worked primarily in sporting goods and automotive and there were only three of us, me, my 75 year old coworker and my department manager. i was alone the first time worm man struck.

if anyone has been to the sporting goods section of any big retail chain, you'll see that 90% of them have this massive u-shaped desk. that's where i was the majority of the time, organzing and reorganizing the pocket knives because i had nothing better to do. 

behind me were a few short aisles with bb guns and bow and arrow equipment, but at the end of leftmost aisle was the worm fridge. the bait kingdom. worms and nightcrawlers people used for fishing and all that. this was the holy grail to worm man.

i was fixing the pocket knives when i heard the fridge door close behind me. confused, because i never heard it open, i looked behind me to greet them and ask if they needed anything. but no one was there.

even more confused, i looked at the fridge and noticed there were a few of the bait containers that were partially open and some knocked over. i rolled my eyes and assumed they were stacked badly so i fixed them. then, i noticed that they were lighter than usual. i opened them up. three of the containers had no worms. the dirt was left behind.

this motherfucker stole only the worms with no container for them.

but djcasheel, you say, what if they were empty on arrival? and to that i say, i spend over an hour every week checking every single container to kill time. it was saturday. i checked these bitches and they were all full.

and it didnt end here!

worm man struck 2 more times over the following month, taking exactly 3 containers of worms without taking the dirt or the container, only the worms. 

people thought i was losing my mind. no one ever caught this bastard man on camera. he knew the cameras blindspots.

i never really told management because i was paid barely above minimum wage and these containers literally only cost like 2 bucks each. i didn't care that much about retail integrity lol.

and then it happened. i saw him. 

worm man.

i was zoning the camo apparel wall and i heard the door open. it's not uncommon for people to not realize i was there, its a quiet corner. i poked my head around the corner and saw a young man, easily late teens, early twenties, just. fucking shoving worms into his pockets. 

i didn't know what to do. just out of pure shock, i gasped and whispered ""its you"". 

worm man gave me the most deer in headlights look you could possibly imagine and he backed aqay very slowly, putting his hands into the pockets of worms. 

i never saw worm man again, and to this day i'm still not sure if this man is real, but if he is, he knows something that we don't, and i live in fear of that thought every day of my goddamn life.

222,“why don’t you dig his receipt out of the trash.”,"typing this on mobile. sorry in advance. 

so i work at a very popular american novelty store. we usually get a lot of teenage customers and most aren’t that bad. but this duo was the worst.

so it was my first day being a sales supervisor and i was already extremely nervous. i was at my register reading emails when two teenage boys walk up to my counter. teen 1 puts a stash jar up on the counter. i politely greet them and ring it up. he pays with cash. we have a strictly no cash return policy (this is important later). i go to hand him his receipt and he tells me to keep it. so i bag the jar and they go in their way. 

now when i’m told to “keep the receipt” in my head that means throw it away. so i do.

about half an hour later they come back, asking to do a return. i call my manager over, let’s pretend her name is vicki, and i ask her if i can do a return with no receipt. she says no. 

“i asked her to keep the receipt.” teen 1 says.

i tell vicki i threw it away. he gets obviously mad

“why don’t you dig it out of the trash then so we can do the return.” teen 2 said. this made my manager mad.

“yeah we aren’t going to do that. but how did you pay?” she asks extremely calmly.

“cash.”

“sorry we don’t do cash returns. i can make you a gift card or you can exchange it but we can’t give you a refund.”

they get pissed but leave. we think it’s over. nope

another 15 minutes pass and they come back to yell at our greeter. he tells them the same thing and they leave. again we think it’s done. 

right as we were closing teen 1 comes in and walks up the counter where my manager is closing her drawer. he slams down a bunch of empty candy wrappers and knocks over our st patrick day bead display. “throw these away with my receipt.” and he leaves. 

we stand there in shock for a few minutes. once we get everything cleaned up and the store closed my manager starts laughing and we go home. definitely the worst costumers i’ve ever had ",PlasticL0ve,tfr
223,rude customer does what he pleases and gets shut down,"this all happened about a few weeks ago (late february 2019).

so i was working afternoon into evening at a gas station/convenience store, and my team lead (tl) was scheduled out earlier than me and got off the clock on time, but stayed an extra hour or so to help me out. tl was getting a few things together to purchase before heading out for the night.

so i got tl all checked out and was chatting for a few minutes, all the while the rude customer (rc) walked in. and while chatting with tl, the customer walks about 4 large steps behind the register counter and looks at what we have on the shelves. tl and i stop our conversation and turn to look at the guy and tl spoke up

tl: sir? do you work here?

rc ignores sl

tl: sir!?-

rc: shut up b****

at this point i instantly see tl turn on ‘boss mode’

tl: sir, if you don’t work here you need to get out from behind the counter!

rc then repeats himself and tl then tells him to “get out from behind her counter” and he does, ever so reluctantly. 

rc gets to the other side of the counter and then while shifting the glasses on his face says to tl something like “do you see these on my face? i can’t see well, and want to see what you have in stock”

tl: then you can ask what we have in stock

rc asked tl something like “and exactly who are you b****” and tl opened her coat to reveal the work shirt and name tag showing her employment at the store.

at this point there may have been more to the interaction that i don’t recall exactly, such as more b-words spouted, enough that i lost count at about eight times. tl told me not to serve rc, rc began asking me to help him and i responded with: “she is technically my boss, so i won’t be serving you”

rc began storming out and yelling out “f*** you b****!” to tl just before leaving.


tl and i just stood there in silence for a good minute or two, both of us completely dumbfounded at how rude this guy was over such a simple thing that could have been handled in a much more civilized manner. and how he believed that just because he couldn’t see and had glasses that must not have helped much either, it gave him the right to walk behind the register to look at our ‘behind the counter’ products.

224,"ma'am, i can't cut your ribbons here- no, we haven't been cutting up here for more than 8 years!","new to this sub-reddit so i thought i'd start off with a simple story.

some context though:

i work at a fabric and crafts store, however we also sell curtains for some reason. in our curtains and dress fabric departments, there is a row of 4 counters with meter rulers and cutting guides made into them (3 with a register attached). in total there are 6 cutting counters available in the entire store for customers to head to. as it is our largest department, our dress fabric cutting counters are the busiest. on days that are very busy, the previous rolls brought up by customers tend to be thrown onto either side of the 2 middle counters, leaving only 2 cutting spots open. the staff try their best to clear the counters to allow for a 3rd area but more often than not, it's just not possible wth the influx of customers. so because there are only 2 people cutting, and the amount of people that decide they want fabric cut all at the same time (as well as being unaware there is another cutting counter around the corner in curtains), some impatient customers are not very polite when they show up at the front registers to pay.

i've had many experiences with customers complaining that the wait took over 30min-1hr (which is ridiculous as i've had many shifts in the department before, as well as brought a lot of fabric from our store; the wait was 5-10min tops). some decide to take matters into their own hands and bring whatever they want cut up to the front counters... which, because we do not have the proper cutting equipment at those counters, we cannot do that. you'd get a bit of grumbling before suggesting them to the curtain's counter, or they'd straight up place the product at the front and leave entirely.

however, being a craft store, our usual customers are old ladies whom tend to be quite impatient (despite having the time to knit many sweaters, scarves and sew multiple quilts) and like to stir up trouble.

the following is the exchange between myself (me) and an elderly lady (customer) that i had recently:*~~\[keep in mind that i've served this lady many times in the past to the point we could practically be on a first name basis.\]~~*

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;me: hello again! did you find everything you needed?  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: most definitely. you have scissors up here, don't you?  
&gt;  
&gt;me: yes we do.

i open the draw underneath the counter to retrieve some scissors. i'm assuming that she's wanted some tags cut off whatever she has (i've done this for her before).

&gt;customer: perfect. *(proceeds to lift entire basket full of cut-by-the-metre ribbon spools onto the counter)* just these for today.

i look up to see the basket and stop what i'm doing. this situation has happened before, and i'm already bracing myself for the wrath of a 80 year old woman. however, i presume that she's forgotten (as she is old) and remain professional and polite.

&gt;me: oh... i'm sorry, ma'am, but i cannot cut these here.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: sorry?  
&gt;  
&gt;me: i'm unable to cut these here.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: but you have scissors, why not?!

i reach back into the draw and pull out the scissors. they're very small, kids-grade scissors which we use to cut tags and paper- definitely not appropriate for ribbons.

&gt;me: these are the only types of scissors we have up here.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: oh, they'll be fine! i only need 2 metres of each.  
&gt;  
&gt;me: we also do not have proper measuring equipment for the process.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: what? you don't even have a ruler or measuring tape?  
&gt;  
&gt;me: we do have rulers, however they're only 30cm ones. not big enough for a transaction such as this.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: you cannot be serious- i used to have things cut up here all the time! they're just ribbons!

now, i really would have liked to have cut these ribbons for her if i could, however, my managers have cameras installed for security reasons behind and in front of the registers. when they're bored, particular managers will just sit in the back, not working their departments (like they should be doing) and just watch the counters because they can. there have been many phone calls made to the front by managers doing exactly this, calling out employees for standing around and talking (even if it's about work). there was no telling whether someone was watching, so i really don't like to risk things such as this.

&gt;me: i'm really sorry, but i can't. i could get in trouble for doing so- it's just our policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: nonsense. i've had ribbons cut up here before!  
&gt;  
&gt;me: i'm sorry, ma'am, but i'll have to direct you to a cutting counter.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: this is ridiculous. i've just come from there! last time i waited in that line it took over 2 hours to get to me. *(of course over exaggerating)*  
&gt;  
&gt;me: i understand that, however i can walk you down to the curtain's counter.  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: but i can't get these cut down there.  
&gt;  
&gt;me: oh?  
&gt;  
&gt;customer: i'm not making curtains, nor do i have any curtain fabric to cut.

you would presume she was trying to make a joke, but i assure you she was dead serious about the matter.

&gt;me: that's okay, ma'am. they're able to cut all fabric's and ribbons in the store down there.

she huffs a little bit before i escort her to the curtain department. this doesn't stop her from complaining though.

&gt;customer: i'd like to have a word with your manager. *~~(here we go)~~* only a few weeks ago you were able to cut all types of fabrics at the front of the store.

we were never able to cut fabrics or ribbons at the front. none of our stores allow it. not even when our store used to be situated down the road at a smaller location, more than 8 years ago.

&gt;customer: and why do you only have one person serving at the cutting counter?

there were surprisingly 3 people serving all day.

&gt;customer: your management needs to get a grip on their customer service and employ more people to work those counters instead of being lazy and paying no-one at all!

we tend to get this complaint a lot, despite the only reason there's any hold up at the counter being the sheer amount of customers who want items cut at the same time. (they'll be waves. you all understand.)

the lady complained all the way down to curtains and continued to complain long after i left. i feel bad for the soul who had to sit through cutting every single one of those ribbons. i hope she was a little more thankful at the end of it all.

&amp;#x200b;

not the most exciting story but it's a simple yet very common occurrence i tend to face in my line of retail. do you guys have any complaints you get all the time?

225,customer thought he could damage property and get away with it!,"my father was a genius at handling rude customers. he was the size of a linebacker, and had a genius iq. so his size intimidated people, as well as his mind. he was also very good at expressing anger, sort of like hulk smash!! so customers learned real quick to be respectful of him. my father was also very respectful of customers, till they weren't to him, then watch out.

a known customer, came into my dad's store, and asked from something my dad's couldn't do for him, (i can't remember what it was now, it's been like 20 years now.)

the guy got pissed at him, he also seemed to be drinking. (we have a gravel parking lot, with gas pumps in a row.)

he got back in his car, floored the gas, throwing rocks everywhere. he broke the glass on 2 of our gas pumps, and damaged the siding of the building by putting a bunch of dents in it with flying rocks.

my dad knows where the guy lives, he quickly closes the store, gets in his big truck, and goes after him. he pulls into the guys driveway, just as the guy is getting out of his car.

sorry, i can't remember what he said, just think hulk smash! my father with ease, picked up the guy and threw him against his car, and held him there off the ground, and told him he'll be paying for all the damage he just caused, or he's calling the police.

the guy was really scared, 1. because everyone is scared when my father gets that angry, and 2. because this guy didn't want a dui on his record!

the guy agreed to pay for everything, and sincerely apologized for his behavior. the guy continued to be a customer of ours, till the day we closed our business around 15 years later.

unfortunately, my father has passed away. he had a mind like a steel trap, and if he was still here, he would fill this thread with story after story  in great detail otherwise. if i can remember anymore, i will post them.

226,i'm supposed to do your job?,"it's a weekend at the former big name retailer and i'm ringing this guy out at checkout and everything is normal so far.

&amp;#x200b;

it's a large purchase, but nothing i haven't seen before (mostly food and random electronics/clothing), so the guy swipes his credit card (this was before the chip readers were installed) and up comes a screen that i had never seen before (i would see it 3-4 more times in my time working there).

&amp;#x200b;

apparently, the card company had seen previously large purchases recently and froze the card under suspicion that it may have been stolen, which is understandable, so i follow the instructions.

&amp;#x200b;

step 1: get a manager/supervisor, so i tell the guy that i need a manager, and go to the wall-mounted phone and page overhead for a manager to call the checkout phone. 2 seconds later it rings and i pick up and explain the situation to him and explain that the further steps require the manager/supervisor to handle the credit card company call (yes, the credit card company needed to be contacted) because i'm not the one who should be doing that.

&amp;#x200b;

the manager (who was the mod; manager-on-duty because he's the assistant manager and the actual manager left for the evening) then told me to do it yourself, but i said to him that i couldn't as i'm not authorized, and then in a demanding tone over the phone...he said...do it yourself.

&amp;#x200b;

i spent 15 minutes calling the credit card company (i want to say it was discover) and verifying that the man using the card was in fact the account holder and was making a purchase at this store, and they did let it go through, but the card had to be swiped again because the first swipe was blocked by their system. (i followed the instructions on the screen, so everything worked out)

&amp;#x200b;

again...i spent 15 minutes away from my register on a weekend (the busiest days of course) talking to a credit card company for a customer (which i'm not allowed to do mind you). i didn't get in trouble for this, but it left me really uneasy about continuing to work at this store.

&amp;#x200b;

surprisingly, no one left my line during those 15 minutes...i was shocked, and they were ok with waiting.

a couple of hours later a pair of police officers came to the store wanting to talk to my manager. i was busy stocking fruits but i saw them head in back presumably to look up security footage, and i went back to my task not thinking more of it. when the officers left with a copy of the footage my manager pulled me aside and asked if i remembered selling two pints of vodka b to a guest. turns out she had recently been released on bail and as part of the release she was only supposed to go to work and her home, and had been given an ankle monitor to track her movements. since the bracelet showed her stopping at the store the cops had come to investigate how badly she had screwed herself. as we were talking they were probably already on their to arrest her for a parol violation and she was more than likely about to be sent back to jail. all for $5 of booze....",Fakjbf,tfr
228,i should be grateful...to lose most of my break?,"this happened a few years ago, and my memory is a little fuzzy on some of the finer details, so my apologies for that, but the important details are still there. also, if you would like to hear more stories of my experiences with customers and even fellow employees, let me know. in the long time i've worked at this particular store, i have no shortage of stories to tell.

once upon a time, i used to work at a grocery store with a prepared food area, where customers could take prepackaged containers of food, collect it from a food bar, or ask us to make it fresh for them. we also accepted larger orders of food, with the understanding that they would call us in advance to give us time to have it made and ready for them when they got there. to be fair, most customers did just that. this group of customers, however, did not.

it was fairly early in my employment (don't think i've even been there a year at the time) and i had just gone on my dinner break. unfortunately, i was the only one working the prepared food area most evenings, so when i went on break, there was no one else there. not long after i had sat down with my food, i see a trio of customers at the food bar, clearly looking for help. i went over to see what was going on and already they're annoyed at me for not being there initially. i ask them how i could help them, and they said they wanted a large order of chicken. now, my understanding at the time was i was not permited to operate the equipment while on break, so what i could do was limited. i explained that to them, and they were not happy with that answer (of course). they argued with me over it for a while, before one of them said if i didn't do it for them right now, they were going to come around the counter and do it themselves. i knew i would get in even more hot water if that happened, especially if they got hurt, so i had to suck it up and just do it.

between preping and cooking the chicken, preparing the container for them to take it home in, cleaning up, and packing the chicken, it took roughly fifteen minutes. about half of my break lost because they couldn't be patient, or call ahead. but that's not even the worst part. when i gave them their order, they told me that i ""should feel grateful to serve that much chicken to the likes of them"". so, i should be grateful that i was forced to give up about half of my break to do a favor for a trio of ingrates. yeah. thanks for nothing.

an older lady comes in to the customer service cash of which i was working at the time. we process returns there and deal with any questions or concerns plus other things that may hold up a line at a regular cash register. anyway, this lady comes over and she was making a purchase. as i was ringing in her items, she mentions to me about a bag of potatoes she had bought about a week ago that had gone rotten. here is what happened from what i can recall from my memory.

me = me, c= customer, s= supervisor.

c: i was wondering if i could get a new bag of potatoes. the other ones i bought last week gone rotten.

me: sure! that's no problem, do you have the bag and your receipt?

c: no i don't, i threw them out.

i was thinking in my head.. okay, well, from what i can recall from similar situations as long as they have their receipt and it's only a few dollars we can process the refund/exchange when it comes to problems with the food. this is just to keep customers happy. they don't even need to have the item with them, as long as they have the receipt they can get the same product or a refund as long as the item is under $3, the manager doesn't care much as this is just to keep customers happy. which i don't have a problem with. not many customers knew this so it wasn't abused much to my knowledge. anyway, continuing:

me: oh. well that's fine, do you have your receipt?

c: no.

me: i would at least need to see the receipt or the potatoes to proceed with the exchange.

c: why would i keep a bag of rotten potatoes? any other store i would go to would give me a new bag on the spot no questions asked!

me: i'm sorry but without the receipt or the item i can't do a an exchange.

this is what we were all trained to do by the way. the store does offer no receipt refunds but it goes onto store credit. but we need the item for obvious reasons such as proof that they actually have the item... we need at least the item or the receipt. both preferably.
the customer starts getting frustrated and keeps repeating how other stores would give her the money back, or offer an exchange and how this store should be ashamed of itself etc. i'm thinking to myself... 'lady.. you can't just walk into a store, say you bought something and want it exchanged without any proof that you have said item to begin with...' 
so after seeing she was getting quite upset, i call my supervisor over so maybe he can help me in this situation. i thought he would have my back on this as it is what we were trained to do.. but oh was i wrong.
so here is what happened after he came over to my cash.

s: what seems to be the problem?

c: i just want a new bag of potatoes. my bag went rotten that i bought last week.

me to my supervisor: she doesn't have the receipt or the bag of potatoes.

s: no problem! i will go get you a new bag of potatoes.

i was frozen for a few seconds thinking to myself... wait what? and the customer gives me this smirk of ""ha. i'm right."" sort of attitude. my supervisor comes back with the new bag of potatoes, puts them in her cart and apologized for the situation and told her to have a good day. she left oh so proud with her new bag of potatoes in the cart with her nose up high. after she left, my supervisor pulled me aside for a minute and said "" we have to make the customers happy. it was just a bag of potatoes, she was just an old lady, you can give her the bag of potatoes.""

i then said to him ""well i was always told we need to see some sort of proof. receipt or item before doing any exchanges.. i don't want to just give away an item""

and he just went on again about how it was only a bag of potatoes and that she was just an old lady blah blah. i was a bit shocked at the whole situation because i thought i was following the right procedure. i never understood why some of the rules are put in place if they get bent for some customers. but oh well.

231,make sure your dog finishes doing it's business before entering the store,"hello, it's the cart/trolley guy again, but this time it has nothing to do with the carts/trolleys.

&amp;#x200b;

my previous job was for a former big name retailer (the place was liquidated due to not turning a budget in years and is now 4 separate stores and is making decent business, so kudos to those stores), and i was working a much worse job...cashier at the federal minimum ($7.25/hour; although i was working about 40hrs/week...for part-time it wasn't too bad)

&amp;#x200b;

anyways, i remember this one fairly well.

&amp;#x200b;

it was a slow night as usual (middle of the week) and it was mainly me and another person at the registers/checkouts, so we passed the time sorting the magazines (taking out the old, putting in the new ones), and about midway through that...a customer came to the checkout area and said someone smeared feces on the floor in the shoes area, and that got me thinking...i did see a guy walk in with his dog (don't know the breed, but i'd probably say beagle or lab), and then later left...i saw them walk from the shoes section, so i put two and two together.

&amp;#x200b;

i went to go see how bad and thought that it was just a small spot...oh boy was i wrong.

&amp;#x200b;

there was a line of it...on the main path and in the aisles, the dog must've been dragging it's bottom on the ground, which would explain the line of crap. (btw, if your dog is dragging it's bottom...you may want to head over to a vet)

&amp;#x200b;

there was no actual solid crap, so that was a plus, but i had to call for a mop and bucket to clean it up, and since it was essentially dead in the store...i volunteered to clean it up; but why did i volunteer you ask? because the maintenance associate had already left for the night, and i wasn't doing anything.

&amp;#x200b;

and people wonder why service dogs are allowed in stores, but not the actual pet. this is the reason.

that store didn't have that rule...ever...at least i think",ARob93,tfr
232,"robber comes to my dad's store and buys a soda, and some smokes...","description of my father.
my father was the size of a linebacker, and had a genius iq. so his size intimidated people, as well as his mind. he was also very good at expressing anger, sort of like hulk smash!! so customers learned real quick to be respectful of him.

also, apparently robbers...

i wasn't there, this is what my father told me.

so, a customer comes into my dad's store, and buys a soda, and some smokes, and leaves.

a couple hours, or so later, a officer walks into the store, and tells my dad a story. see, apparently, that customer went a mile down the street, and robbed the next store, but somehow was caught shortly after.

the officer asked the robber, what he did before he robbed the store?

robber: i left my house, and stopped by ____ store, to buy a soda, and some smokes, then i came here and held them up.

officer: wait!, you stopped at ____, why didn't you rob him?

robber: oh hell no!, ____ has a huge gun!!!

the officer and my dad laughed! the officer thought that was so funny, he had to come to the store, and tell him what happened. :)",VRIceblast,tfr

234,"“be careful, it’s sharp and can easily cut you”","so for 4 and a half years, i worked at a smaller hardware store with a big name in the city i live in. this story stands out among numerous other stories.

one day, i had a customer come in, she was an older women that i could already tell was going to be hard to deal with. lets call her ow for older woman. she walks up to me and it starts. 

me: “hi, how can i help you today?”

ow: “i need quarter inch glass cut to 24x30.”

me: okay, i can do that for you. i can cut it and leave it as is or i can sand down the edges for a little extra because they will be pretty sharp”

ow: “you can just leave it as is”

me: “alright it will take about 10 minutes”

so i go to the back room and do my thing, cut the glass, wrap it up in paper (to protect the sharp edges), and calculate the pricing. bring it up to her and remind her about the sharp edges, and she checks out and leaves.

about an hour passes and i help other customers (most of them lovely people who i knew by name), then back in comes old women. 

ow: “the glass you cut for me earlier cut my hand and my daughters hand. i want to return it and get a refund.”

me: “sorry ma’am, we don’t give refunds on cut items and i warned you multiple times that it would be sharp. i’d be happy to sand down the edges for you so it won’t happen again.”

she starts to throw a big scene and starts yelling at me and asks to see a manager. i happily obliged and called my manager over.

m: “hi, what can i help you with today?”

ow: “i want a refund on the glass i bought.”

m: “sorry ma’am, we don’t give refunds on cut items.”

ow who is even more pissed off: “but me and my daughter cut our hands on it!”

m:”yeah! it’s glass! it’s sharp!”

the old women seemed so shocked and she just left the store, never to be seen again, thank god. ",MyYummyYumYum,tfr

236,"""but i am always a size 9!""","i work at a shoe store and i had a woman come in wanting to try on a pair of shoes. these shoes she wanted to try on are unisex, however, obviously the size for men and women are different.

&amp;#x200b;

the woman asks for a size 9 so i go to the back and get out a size 9 for her. she tries it on and says it is a bit too small for her, so i suggest going a size up. the woman frowned at me and said ""but i'm always usually a size 9... can you get me a size 9 in men's?""

&amp;#x200b;

i explained to the woman that the conversion of sizes makes it different and that a size 9 in men's fits like a size 11 in women's, obviously way too big for her. i suggested going to a size 10 in women's. 

&amp;#x200b;

the woman shook her head and she was very adamant, saying ""just bring out the size 9 in men's. i am always usually a 9. this is ridiculous.""

&amp;#x200b;

i decided to go to the back to get a men's size 9 pair out for her in the case maybe seeing the physical size difference would make her change her mind. i brought it out and she insisted on trying it on. even just at a glance, the shoes were way too big for her and she had to tie the laces really tight just to get them to stay on her foot. however, the woman nodded. ""yup, this will work. i told you i am always a size 9!"" 

&amp;#x200b;

i kept asking the woman if the shoe fit alright (which it clearly did not) and if her heel lifts up as she walks (which it clearly did) but she insisted it was good. i even tried to convince her to just try on a women's 10 ""just to be sure"" and she insisted the men's size 9 was good. 

&amp;#x200b;

after a while, i reluctantly began to ring her up when she said she wants to wear the shoes out and for me to throw away the box. i told her that this would make the shoes final sale and there will be no way of returning them once i throw out the box and let her wear them out. again, i asked her if she was sure the size was okay. the woman nodded and said ""i am always a size 9. have been for years."" 

&amp;#x200b;

i cringed as she wobbled out of the store wearing the shoes that were too big for her. i talked to my manager about what happened and my manager, like me, was confused but since the woman was adamant she get those shoes, we just disregarded it and hoped she wouldn't turn it around on us and make a complaint to customer service about how the shoes we got her were ""too big"".

239,power goes out at work...so do customers brains.,"so for anyone that has worked pretty much anywhere, but especially in retail you know that when the power goes out there is an immediate feeling of confusion on what the next move you need to make is. i worked in a grocery store as a cashier and on the hottest day of summer the power went out. i was bagging for one of my other coworkers and all the lights went out. to be honest i was pretty excited and yelled ""cool we all get to go home"" of course that didn't happen but i could dream. since there are big windows in the front of the store where the cash registers were we could still see because it was 4 in the afternoon when the power went out. 

all of the cash registers shut off except for one, the one i was helping bag, since she was in the middle of scanning i believe there was a fail safe in the computer that was able to still scan and work for an additional 5 minutes before shutting down. (i don't remember exactly why it was still on all i know is that it was on and she was able to continue scanning while all of the other computers shut down.)

so, my manager had her stay ringing and told the rest of us to start telling customers that they need to leave and we would take their carts and put the items back for them. my manager had also informed the customer who was being rung up and the one after them that they were the only ones who would be able to get their items. i started walking around the store and telling customers ""i'm really sorry, but since the power is out we will not be able to ring your items up."" now for the most part many people understood this, however, i got replies like ""well when will the power be back on?"" or ""but i'm not done shopping"" or my favorite ""its okay i'll wait until it comes back on.""

i walked back up to the front and one of my managers told me to go guard the entrance/exit, and let customers out but to apologize to any customers trying to come in and explain the situation to them. the front doors are near the cash registers so i was able to see what was going on there and be the door monitor. i opened the door for customers leaving and apologized for the inconvenience i had one man say ""i can't believe this i am going to shop else where"" like the power going out was something we planned and did on purpose. 

it seemed that the cash register was able to continue working for a little longer than 5 minutes and they were able to help one more family check out before it shut down completely. there was a family of a mother, father, and two daughters between ages 10-14. they were regulars, mainly the mother, and she was one of my least favorite customers who came in because she was just one of those customers who always had something to complain about. as they started to walk towards the exit the mom stopped and looked at her receipt she then starts to go through the bags and pulls out a jar of honey, ""wow they overcharged me for this honey i thought it was only $8.99 not $14.99"" (by the way it is impossible for us to overcharge her, she had just grabbed the more expensive jar) the husband said ""its okay we can come back tomorrow when the power is back on and deal with it then lets go"" she says ""no i am not coming back tomorrow i want my refund now"" one of the daughters was pleading to her mom ""come on mom they were nice enough to ring up our stuff the power is out can we please go??"" 

the mom ignored them and walked over to customer service to complain and demand a refund. the family just stood back looking defeated, and surprise surprise the mom returns still angry and complains about how she can't get her refund because ""the systems are down"" she said in a mocking way. i opened the door for them and told them to have a great rest of their day. i did enjoy seeing her not get her way.

we finally were able to get all of the customers out and put all of their items back on the shelves, and get our back up generator running to keep all of the frozen and cold food from going bad. we turned away many more customers who were pulling up trying to shop. one of my manager was even offered $20 for a gallon of milk from a lady who apparently could only buy it from our store. 

i later found out that the power outage covered half of the city and was out for almost 12 hours before coming back on at 3 in the morning.

&amp;#x200b;

overall, i learned that even when situations are completely out of our hand people will still demand their items because they are there, and they need these things. to be honest i think people expected us to just let them have their stuff for free because the power outage inconvenienced them.",tearsxrain,tfr
240,"""that's not my change!""","i'm the assistant manager at a gas station attached to a grocery store. corporate has decided not to shell out for a register program that actually is suited to the needs of a gas station, and instead we're saddled with a frankensteinien abomination of a program. when a customer pays for gas, the system treats it as if the customer is purchasing exactly that much; as such, if a customer does not use all the fuel that they've ""bought"", they must return to the cash booth so we can manually return and refund it. 

&amp;#x200b;

after a while, you get to be pretty good at recognizing when a customer is coming back for their change. today, i saw an elderly gentleman coming back with his receipt, and so i quickly cashed out his change and placed it on the counter for him.  


him: ""somebody's left their change here.""

me: ""no, sir, that's the change from your transaction.""  
him: ""no, it isn't. this is my receipt right here.""

me, taking the change back behind the counter, but plainly still in his sight: ""ah, yes, quite right. may i see your receipt?""

he hands it over, and without looking at the receipt, i pick up the pile of change and hand it to him. he trundles off quite happily.

i was working at a grocery store. i had the closing shift this time. i'd say it was around 8:30 to 9pm when two young girl come to my register and tells me they want to get drunk fast. they were very nice, they werent rude at any time, they were just sooo.... you'll see for yourself. 

they wanted to know what was the better way, a 750ml big bottle of 12% strong micro brew black beer that they would share or 2 normal size 7% pale ale beer. i tell them it depends on what kind of taste they like but they tell me they dont care if it taste like crap, they want to get drunk to celebrate their 18 birthday (of course i checked their cards, they were indeed 18). so i tell them the 12% was best because, well its a black beer and its 12%. but then they ask me the question

''yeah but we'll be sharing, so doesnt that mean we'll only have 6% each?''

i was so shocked by this question i froze, trying my best not to laugh.  
i tried my best to make up an explanation in my mind so they would understand, but in my shocked state it was futile, so i ended up saying

''yeah you're right''

i ring them up, they took the 2 small beers and left super happy and exited.

as soon as they left i burst out laughing and told to all my coworker present at the time.

242,wannabe thief gets locked up in more ways than one.,"i'm really new to posting on here and i've only had an account for a few days. i've read quite a few fantastic stories over that short period and would like to share one of my many tales from working in and around retail/customer services.

first of all sorry for the crappy format i'm on mobile. secondly here's the character key. (wt)- wannabe thief (me) yours truly.

bit of background info before i dive in. back in 2016 i was working as a relief deputy manager for a high street bookmakers (betting shop). basically this meant i was sent all around the district to open and close up shops and basically manage when staff members were absent.

the time this takes place i had been stationed at the same shop for several months due to the regular manager being out sick due to being in a car accident. i'd been on shift for most of the evening and was now working on my own preparing the shop for closing. i decided to do this earlier as i'd not had a single customer for the best part of 2 hours. well i activated the magnetic lock on the shop door and go about my business emptying all the cash from the gaming machines stationed on the shop floor. whilst i was doing this i set the events screens to display the cctv footage so i can keep an eye out for anything that might be of concern. out of the corner of my eye on the cctv i notice wt who was known to be underage and not a very nice person in general just loitering around just in view of the shop. i see him walk off up the street and think nothing of it. i carried on cashing up and dropping the money to the safe's timed insert. i'm all but finished when there's a loud bang on the shop door. i look up thinking it's gonna be wt i'm rather surprised when it turns out to be one of the regular customers coming in to collect some winnings. i pay him which leaves me with hardly any money at all until the shop opens again in the morning. i pressed the button which disengaged the mag lock and let him out of the shop as he leaves wt somehow manages to sneak into the shop before the mag lock can engage.

wt swaggers up to the counter with his hoodie pulled up and a scarf wrapped around his face hoping i won't recognize him even though he wears the same hoodie all the time. he tries to put on a deeper voice and then pulls out a knife from somewhere.

wt 'give me all the money from the till or i'm gonna stab you'

i know what's going on but it doesn't quite sink in so i sit there without speaking for a moment.

wt ""give me all the money or i'm gonna stab you"" he repeats 

i then realized the stupidity of wt he's waving a kitchen knife at me through a gap no bigger than his hand and there is no way he can get to me due to the bandit screens which can withstand a shotgun blast.

me ""nope not gonna happen""

wt ""do it or i'm gonna stab the next person who comes in""

me ""good luck with that""

wt ""just f*cking do it i'm not joking""

at this point i blatantly laugh at him and say ""what are you gonna do if i don't wt?""

i stood up and pressed the shop security alarm which automatically connected me to the company security who proceeded to take my version of events and log into our cctv they replied by telling me to comply with wt and that a police unit had been dispatched to my location. i told them that i couldn't comply as there is no money on the premises

i look up and wt is still stood there. i look at him and i can see the realization creep over his face that i know who he really is and what's gonna happen. he drops the knife and makes a dash for the door and starts screaming that he can't get out. tbh until this point i'd genuinely forgot the mag lock was still active. wt is now looking absolutely petrified as he can't leave the shop. i sit back down and wait for police to arrive. when they do wt is crying in the corner of the shop.

it ended up being taken to court and him pleading guilty to attempted robbery and possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to inflict harm. being underage he only got 18 months in juve and a slap on the wrist he walked after serving only 6. it kinda pissed me off that i also got fired by the area manager for failing to comply with wt's demands and apparently endangering myself and others around me. 

up until recently i was embroiled in a legal battle with my former employer regarding my dismissal. they've finally settled out of court with a £52,000 payment.

243,"next time, make sure the person you road rage at isn't your cashier.","fuel clerk 

we're an extension of a grocery store and we don't have our own facilities, so the grocery store sends a clerk down to cover our register while we go to the store and use the bathroom. it's not far at all, maybe 300 feet, but i always take my car just because it's a little faster than walking and i feel safer in my car than i do walking through a parking lot. for exactly this reason. 

i was on my way back to the gas station and as you leave the grocery store part, you have to stop at a 4 way and then continue on to the gas station. well i stopped, and a man in a 1500 truck behind me stopped. as i started to pull forward, for some reason he cuts out from behind me so that he's beside my car in the opposite traffic lane and proceeds to cut his wheel to the right, loudly flooring his truck so the exhaust roars directly in my ear and turning it directly in front of my car. if i wasn't just leaving from a dead stop then i wouldn't have been able to stop in time, that's how close he was to ramming the front end of my car. 

obviously, i laid on my horn as i slammed my brakes on and then continue once he also stops. then he has the audacity to lay on his horn back at me and call me vulgar names out the window. i watch him in my mirror as i pull into the gas station, hoping and praying that he leaves and doesn't turn in. no such luck. 

a few minutes later, he comes up to my window and doesn't recognize me, but i let him know that i'm the one he almost hit. i'll be me, he'll be md for moron driver. he's mid-late 30s.

244,woman gets peed off i get sent for my lunch break.,"i work saturdays 1200 till 2100 my lunch is at 1600 and i would say it had just gone couple minutes past 1600 when i was just about to finishing serving the couple i had at my till when my supervisor came over and told me to go on my lunch. so as i always do when i'm in the middle of the sales, i finish the sales tell the customer to have a lovely weekend and then proceeded to place the ""till closed"" sign over the front of the till and sign off the till. however this time after i had just placed the ""till closed"" sign over the front of the till this woman came up to the till and places her items onto the till and demanded that i serve her. i politely and calmly explained that i had just closed the till and i was about to go on my lunch hour. she proceeded to shout at me how this was terrible customer service and then walked off in a huff.

note: i must add i do not get paid for my lunch hour and i am excepted to be on the shop floor at 1700 so anytime i spent longer on the shop floor is up to me and i do not get paid for it therefore i do not serve the next person when sent for my lunch i only finish serving the person that i am serving. which most people in my company don't bother doing.

245,"""so what do you have in my size?"""," something i hear way too often in my line of work. 

  
  for context- i'm the assistant manager of a small shoe franchise that carries four different brands of shoes next to other assorted clothing and accessory items. our shop itself isn't very big, but despite that we carry a variety of around 800-900 different models, including all the leftover ones from past seasons we put on sale in our downstairs area. i get that it doesn't appear as much, since we only put single shoes out on display so that customers have to come to the staff and request their size. 

  
  but for the love of god. 

  
  if i had a dollar for every time a customer got annoyed with me for being out of stock on a pair they wanted and said ""well then, just bring me everything you do have in my size!"" i'd be able to pay off my debt and live happily ever after. but alas. it isn't even common to tip retail worker in germany, let alone give them anything but an eyeroll or humph in response when we tell our treasured customers to have a nice day. 

  
  i digress. on one particular day i had my typical stressed grandparent dragging their dismissive grandchild in with them, asking for something in the kids size. usually we ask if they at least have a preference in color, style or at least a brand, since even the kid models range up to a variety of 150. the kid was having none of it though and just wanted this to be over with, so the grandparent gave me the ""just bring everything you have in x and y size."" especially with kids nothing unusual, they're often between sizes and almost each brand fits differently. 

  
  in my head i'm already calculating the amount of boxes that this will amount to and my well practiced customer service smile cracks for a split second before gaining my composure and assuring them that it'd be no problem. over the years i've learned that it's easier to operate on spite and give them what they want, rather than trying to explain that it'd be ridiculous to leave them with 50+ boxes they could never navigate through anyway. 

  
  so i return shortly after releasing steam in the storage, carrying my first tower of shoe boxes over to them when i see the grandparents face drop.     
  ""that'd be all the z brand ones, i'll be right back with the rest."" i announce cheerful as can be and already turn on my heels, when i hear the grandparent mutter that this is ridiculous, all they wanted were a completely different brand that we don't even carry, mind you, in the color black. hearing that i stop in my tracks and turn back to them with a more strained smile to inform them that i'm really sorry, but our store won't have what they're looking for. 

  
  grandparent was not amused, accused me of bad customer service and dragged the now wailing grandkid back outside to take their business elsewhere.

246,"""you opened ten minutes late""","i work as a cashier in a big supermarket in the uk. i start work before the tills open on sundays, so do other jobs for the first few hours of my shift. the store itself opens half an hour before the tills open. i happened to be at the front of the store so was asked to open up and let the customers in, where i was met with a man who asked why we left everyone standing out in the cold. let's say the store opens at 10:30. a quick glance at my watch tells me it's 10:33. i tell the guy that i just opened up when i was asked to, so he tells me to take him to whoever gave me the order to open up. i kinda eavesdrop on the ensuing mess as he asks my colleagues why we opened ten minutes late, is shot down when they show him multiple clocks and watches that say it's only 10:35 at this point, he yells at one of my colleagues for not looking at him when he's talking to her (she glanced away for a moment to place a scanning handset into a rack, and the man had the full attention of the other colleague next to him), and then went on to customer services to get them to contact a manager. what was his problem?",ArtemisMartin,tfr
247,this person forgot all about math and logic,"i'm sorry, english is not my first language, there are terms about cashiering that i dont know

gl = grumpy lady

me = do i have to explain?

c = customer

m = manager

i still remember this lady vividly as she was the first dumb/rude client i got in retail.

i was a cashier in a grocery store and was working the morning shift. the ''breakfast rush'' was long gone and the place was mostly empty and quiet. until a lady (in her 45-50) comes to me. i politely say the typical ''hi, did you find everything you needed?'' and starts working as usual. she tells me to bag her things lightly so i oblige. in total it must have weight around 20-25 kg  (44-55 pounds) worth of food. i pack her food lighter than i would normally and make sure bags are approximately the same weight, in other word, i did my job. after she's done paying, she tries to pick all her bags and fails. she then dead glare me and says

gl : you idiot! i told you to pack my bag light, i have a long way to walk home, those bags are too heavy!

i was a bit taken aback by this because my first logic thought was ''why buying 20kg of food if you cant carry it?''

me : i'm sorry ma'am but i did as you said, i spread the weight equally but...

gl : i dont care if they're all equal in weight, its too heavy!

me : \*trying to be logic\* if its too heavy for you we have a delivery service if you want i can-

gl : i dont want to pay extra, just do your job and pack my things lighter!

she was basically screaming at that point. i tried to explain that even if i spread the weight through 50 bags, if she picks them all up at once, together they will still weigh the same. she was having none of it and kept making a scene. she asked to see the manager witch i promptly called because at that point i wanted nothing more to do with her. while waiting for my manager to arrived, the lady kept yelling and cussing at me while i was ringing another customer (c). my manager arrived and asked what was going on.

gl : this lady here is incompetent, you should fire her immediately!

m : there is no need to scream ma'am. \*looking at me\* what's going on?

me : i-

gl : she packed my thing way to heavy on purpose!

my manager knew me well enough to know i wouldn't do such a thing as i usually went out of my way to accommodate customers.

m : (with a cold ''i dont have time for this'' voice) may i take one bag to check?

gl was so sure she was right gave her a bag. my manager looked at her and straight up said ''this bag isn't heavy, i dont see the problem?'' gl face turned red in anger and started yelling at my manager that she had to walk home with all those heavy bags and she had a long walk to go. my manager told her we did deliveries, but gl, again, didn't listened and pointed the finger at me calling me incompetent and other lovely names.

c got mad at her and said firmly ''ma'am, will you please shut up, she did exactly what you asked, its your fault for buying to much groceries, she cant magically make your grocery weigh less.''her face was worth all the gold in the world.  i think at that moment she was both shocked to be treated so poorly by someone as well as feeling ashamed of her lack of logic, as if she understood the point i was trying to make earlier. she picked up her bags and left hissing at staring at me as if it was all my fault. my manager laughed as soon as she left.

i seriously have no idea how this woman though that by spreading the weight in many bags it would make the whole thing weigh less.

tl:dr : a woman thought that if i put her groceries in more bags, it would make the total weight less heavy and she got mad at me after reality hit her.

248,i have seven thousand dollars in my pocket right now that i wanted to spend but you won't be getting any of it!,"man, working in retail really shows you what kind of people exist in the world, doesn't it?

yesterday, i was managing the floor at my store, greeting customers, delegating tasks to colleagues etc. we had a launch on friday of a new product so we've been incredibly busy.

last night during a really busy period, i was already with a customer when a man (man) walked past. he was wearing headphones and appeared to be talking to someone, so i smiled at him and said ""hey, how are ya?"". he ignored me and went to go browse at tablets.

about a minute later (literally a minute lol), i'm still with my customer, my staff are still busy doing their jobs, and he begins to walk off still talking to someone through his headphones. as he walks by, my customer begins to walk off too and i say ""bye guys! have a good night!"" man turns around and starts yelling:

&gt;**man:** have a good night? i have been in here, for five minutes, and not once was i asked if i needed help  
&gt;  
&gt;**me:** i'm sorry, you were on the phone to someone and as you can see we're all busy with customers. is there something i can help you with?  
&gt;  
&gt;**man:** on the phone???   
&gt;  
&gt;**me:** oh, it looked like you were speaking with someone, i thought you didn't hear me when i asked how you were because you were in a conversation.  
&gt;  
&gt;**man:** well i *wasn't* and i just want you to know that *you've* lost a *customer* and i have *seven thousand dollars* in my *pocket* right now that ***i wanted to spend*** but you won't be getting ***any*** of it!

he begins to walk away.

&gt;**me**: no worries mate, i hope your night gets better.  
&gt;  
&gt;**man: i** ***hope*** **that's not sarcasm**

he storms off into the shopping centre and starts yelling at random people ""warning"" them not to come in and announcing to the world that he's going to go buy \[competitors product\].

249,are you just going to ignore the pee?!?!,i worked at an office supply store and it was one of the only ones for miles so we usually got people from out of town. we closed at 9pm and a costumer ran to the fore before i locked it and said they drove 2 hours with the 2 young girls they begged to shop so they didn’t have to come back. it was back to school time so i asked a manager and she decided she was fine with it and understood because she lived far from the store too. she keeps one register open and counted the other ones and everyone left except me and the manager. i was helping the mother and father get everything on the list while the little girls played hide and seek around our furniture displays. the final thing on the list is a desk and chair so we head over to the displays and they pick out the one they want when i smell something a bit off. i looked around while they where deciding what color they wanted the desk when i saw it. there was a huge ass puddle under one of our desk displays. apparently when the little girls where playing hide and seek the younger looking one got startled by her sister jumping out to find her and peed herself. i wasn’t sure if the parents had seen anything till the mother ran over and took her daughters to the bathroom immediately. i didn’t know how to handle the situation and waited for the father to at least acknowledge what jus happened but he didn’t say a word! he chose the desk color and wanted a chair next and walked to the desk with the pee under it and said he wanted the chair at that desk without even so much as a glance at the puddle. i got him a chair from the back and told my manager over the radio about what just happened. she was new as a manager so she had no clue what to do except call the general manager. she told me just to take the farther to the front and check him out so i did just that. the mother then came back and left the store and i locked up behind them and at no point did they say anything about the incessant not even an “ops” or “sorry”. i went to se how bad the damage was because the whole store was carpeted and found out that there was a whole trail of drips all the way back to the bathroom. the bathroom that had been cleaned earlier was now covered with toilet paper on the ground to soak up the pee and needed to be re cleaned. since we couldn’t clean the carpet ourselves the general manager came to the store with a koala carpet cleaning team to take car of it for us. we where at the store till 12:30am 3 and a half hours after we closed just cleaning the mess. ,lordpi1999,tfr
250,the customer was confused... and now i am too.,"this happened yesterday and i’m still a little boggled by it. the usual: me = me, cc = confused customer 

so as background, i work in an upscale supermarket in the us and we recently started carrying biltong (a south african jerky) and... that’s pretty much the only important detail. 

cc: do you carry biltong? i saw it on tv and i want to try it. 

me: yes. let me show you where it is. (walks to jerky section) okay, so we have a savory one and a spicy one. 

cc: (looking at package) what is it? 

me: it’s a type of beef jerky. 

cc: but when i saw it on tv it looked like chips and they were cutting it off a big piece. 

me: well, i had another customer tell me that in south africa you can get it cut to order but here we only have the kind that’s already packaged. 

cc: so what is it? (still holding package)

me: ...beef...jerky...

cc: but what is beef jerky? 

me: a dried, spiced meat product. 

cc: i don’t think i’ll like that. my daughter certainly won’t eat it. i’ll pass. 

me: okay, have a nice day.  

cc: (walking away) i like baklava better. 

me: whaaaaaatttt

so basically now i just have all the questions. did she think it was a greek dessert? did she think it was a potato chip? what did she think they were slicing it off on whatever show she was watching? how did she not know what jerky was? how could she not tell it was meat when she was holding the package??? it says “beef” on the package. 

anyway. she’s confused. i’m confused. i hope you’re mildly entertained by my story. ",boring_average_user,tfr
251,old guy just really wants some nuts,"so last night, i was at work (cashier at a grocery store) and i'm doing general tidying since it isn't busy. the new cashier asked me about doing a return, and i told her to call our supervisor.  cast is as follows: s=supervisor, oc=old customer.

&amp;#x200b;

so, i had just finished doing some put aways when i went back to my till right before my break and thats when i just stand there to over hear this transaction. 

&amp;#x200b;

oc: i bought these peanuts for $4.97 and now they are $3.97. i want a refund.

s: (looks at the receipt) oh sir, you purchased this on the 7th (thursday) and the sale started the 8th (friday, sales always start fridays), and thats why it is now ringing up as a dollar less.

oc: well i want a refund and i want to keep the peanuts

s: i can do a refund and ring it through at the sale price, and give you the dollar difference. (which, by the way, she absolutely did not have to do since he bought it before they went on sale)

oc: well why would i want that? giving me a dollar back isn't doing me any favours! i want a full refund!

s: sure thing sir.

she started to do the refund, and then this rude ass guy said 

oc: is there a manager here? this is ridiculous.

at that point, i had to walk away before i said something that got me into trouble. i told her when i got back from my break that she has way more patience than me, and i definitely would not have given him even the dollar difference. when i told one of my other supervisors what happened, she agreed with me that s did not have to do anything for that guy, and giving him the dollar difference would actually be doing him a favour. i even know that the store owner would have stood up for us for that one, since he was not over charged. honestly, this guy made such a stink over a can of freaking peanuts. customer service really does suck sometimes.

252,"the chicken made me fat, give me my money back.","so i have worked retail for a little over 7 years now, so i have plenty of stories that i can share but i think my best one was from less than a year ago. i wasn’t at the store when this happened but this story has been told to me by the three employees who had to deal with it. 

backstory, i work at a large multinational company and we have our own brand of generic items. not much is different except maybe a couple ingredients or the way it is made, but it’s never anything massively below brand name quality.

now to the story. a larger man had come into the store one night about 2 hours before closing. he had three completely empty bags of our generic brand chicken wings. as i’ve been told he went up to our cashier and demanded a refund for the chicken. the cashier we had working at the time has some mental issues due to a stroke he had as a young child, so he isn’t very good with confrontation, (although to this day he is still and always will be the customer favorite). so he calls the manager on duty who comes over. the man demands that the manager gives him a refund for the chicken.

now this manager isn’t a push over in the slightest so he simply said no and tried to walk away. the customer continued to demand that he be refunded because “the chicken was too fattening.” to which my manager admitted he chuckled at as the man was (according to him) well over 300 pounds (136kg for the rest of the world). the man began yelling and screaming at both my manager and my coworker, and more or less forced my manager to call the store manager.  the store manager offered to refund one of the bags and the man reluctantly accepted knowing he wouldn’t get any better.

about two days later our store gets a call from our district management about how we refused to refund someone for a “faulty product” once the situation was explained even the dm found it amusing.

tldr: fat man comes in to return eaten bag of chicken, complains to corporate, and is still joked about in the store today.",DizzyBet,tfr
253,an unfortunate refusal,"i work at a gas station that has filling stations for regular gas (unleaded and premium), diesel and propane.  the latter is what this story is all about.  it is about maybe 30 minutes before i am supposed to clock out when we have someone in a food truck pull up to the propane filling station and bring out a small tank and then lift the flap up for his vehicle's tank.  donning my personal protective equipment (ppe) i head outside and talk to the customer, nice fellow sells filipino food.

&amp;#x200b;

i inspect the small tank as i already had the nozzle for it attached and it passes visible inspection (it's not expired and there are no holes in and it has the right type of valve on it.)  that gets filled pretty quickly and then i detach the standard nozzle for the vehicle tank nozzle (some trucks and campers have propane tanks hooked up to them underneath.)  i hate these things as they are always a pain in the ass to inspect and attach the nozzle to.  everything seems fine, keyword being seems.

&amp;#x200b;

so i ask them if everything is off, engine, pilot light and that everyone is out of the vehicle.  they answer yes to everything.  seems pretty straight forward.  i fumble around with the nozzle as usual with these things as it's a pain to get them to attach.  a few mental profanities and a connected hose later, i turn the filling station on and then open the valve on the tank to fill.  immediately propane and the chemical they add to give it color and smell (propane is colorless and odorless by itself by the way), begins coming out from the  main valve, that opens and closes the tank.  that is not where you want propane to come from.  i shut everything down and disconnect the hose.  where the nozzle connects to the tank spits out propane, so i poke inside there with a screwdriver and it shoots out a bit more and then stops.  

&amp;#x200b;

shaking a little while fending off a panic attack i turn to address the driver that i cannot fill his propane tank under his vehicle but he had gone inside.  cleaning up the filling station area and making sure there were no further leaks from his tank i go back inside to deliver the bad news.

&amp;#x200b;

me: ""i am sorry sir but the tank under your vehicle is not safe to fill."" 

&amp;#x200b;

customer: ""they filled it down there last time..."" he points towards our fuel dock. 

&amp;#x200b;

me:  ""well it's leaking out propane where propane isn't supposed to be coming out, that is not safe and i am not allowed to fill it.""

&amp;#x200b;

the customer doesn't seem to get this fact and repeats what he had said the first time.  we go back and forth on this a bit, not yelling but both getting annoyed.  


me:  ""sir there is propane leaking from your tank where it should not be coming out of.  one stray spark could cause it to explode and that could trigger our filling station's tank to explode which might set off the rest of the station and kill a good portion of downtown. ""  i say giving him the worst case scenario.  ""i am not doing this to be mean, i want you to have a full tank, but i cannot in good conscience and out of preservation for your life, mine and potentially countless others fill that thing.""

&amp;#x200b;

i guess it sinks in as his eyes widen, the fact that one screw up could cause such a horrifying result he asks if we could fix the tank.  i tell him we can't but if he wants to talk to our fuel dock that he could go by there tomorrow as they are closed on sundays.  ",Malharon,tfr

&amp;#x200b;

me: hello, how may i help you ? 

om: my remote is not working with my tv and i want to send it for repairs.

me: sure i'm just going to try it out on our own tv. 

i go in to our test section in the back and connect it to our test tv and it works just fine. 

me: the remote works just fine so it doesn't need to be sent out for repair. 

om: but it doesn't work. 

me: i just tested it in the back and it works just fine. 

he then starts arguing with me back and forth about the remote not working which it clearly did. 

om: i would like to speak with your supervisor. 

so i go get my supervisor and explain the situation to him. 

s: so op here says your remote works just fine which means we wont send it out to repair. 

om: keeps arguing with my manager. 

one of the tv sales people hear the man arguing with us and comes over. 

ts: are you sure you have connected the remote properly to your tv ? 

om: how can i connect it when it doesn't turn on my tv ? 

suddenly we all realise what the problem is. if you buy a spare remote you always have to connect it to the tv when its on. 

ts: oh, then follow me and i will show you how to connect it. 

so ts shows om how to connect the remote to the tv while i watch him do it. 

me: so now you know how to connect it to the tv im sure you are satisfied with this solution. 

om: but my tv doesnt turn on without a remote ! 

me: ts just showed you how to turn on the tv without the remote. 

om: yes i have had the tv for 3 years and im sure it doesn't have these buttons.

the buttons were actually quite hidden under the tv and there was no text to tell which button did what. 

me: i'm quite sure it does so i can't really help anymore but please contact our customer service if you still can't connect the remote to the tv. 

om starts calling me incompetent and starts getting quite mad until my manager steps in and tells the man just to go and try again on his tv. 

a couple day later om calls in to our stores customer service and starts apologizing for acting so rude and said he found the buttons on his tv and got the remote connected.

for context, i work at a small franchise that sells batteries for just about everything from cellphones to big rigs. we aren't your typical walmartesque type of place. we have some very talented people on staff. i am the advanced diagnostic technician for all consumer electronics devices. aka phones, laptops, tablets, etc. things that no other store in my franchise can figure out gets sent to me, and i often have to work on things under a microscope, so attention to detail is one of my strong suits. to get to where i am i had to learn everything there is to know about the batteries and circuits that we sell and occasionally work the counter on odd days. 

od: old dude
me: me

od: *comes in with a regular 9 volt battery* 
me: hello sir, how can i help you today
od: can you help me find this odd type of battery for my smoke alarm?

i'm a little confused at this as 9 volts are the most common battery out there especially in smoke alarms. so i ask to take a look, just to see if it's any specific type of 9 volt. thinking he wanted to match the brand or something. it was a no name brand and just said 9v smoke alarm battery.

me: well, we dont carry this exact brand but i do have 4 different brands to choose from. they range between x for this brand and y for that brand.
od:no no no, i've tried a regular 9 volt and it doesn't stop the darn thing from beeping. 

i've come across issues before where people keep batteries for long periods of time in storage or even in refrigerators and are surprised when they are dead even though they're ""brand new"".

me: well sir, all of these batteries are the same in the way they function, different brands just determine how long the last. like x brand will last this long, y brand will last this long in a standard smoke detector, but 9 volts is 9 volts. 
od:no! this is a smoke alarm battery and its smaller than a regular 9 volt. i really need this smoke alarm battery. 

me being a little annoyed at this point proceed to hold it up against every other 9 volt we carried. the way each manufacturer seals the battery can affect the total length by about 1mm. i of course mention this as i'm comparing them. 

od: no, see they are smaller.
me: no sir they really aren't. i can prove it.

i proceed to grab my micrometer (basically a ruler but more accurate) and measure each battery difference between the 2 is less than .05mm

me: see sir...
 
he ignores me and proceeds to grab a couple of brands and reads the packaging on each. 

od: y brand says it lasts 10 years in smoke detectors but it only has a 1 year warranty, that's unacceptable.
me: batteries like these rarely even come with warranties because of the wide variety of devices that they're used in. that's actually the only battery with any sort of warranty.
od: man i just want my smoke alarm battery
me: *just wanting this guy to leave* well, i've sold all these brands for smoke alarms and they've worked in every single one ive installed them in, but y brand (the most expensive one) is the only brand that even says smoke alarm on the packaging. 
od: fine just give me that
 
i finish ringing him out and sent him on his way. he came in again when i was off and it turns out his smoke alarm had a broken wire. easy 2 min fix for us so we didn't charge him. i understand being confused about batteries, theres thousands of them. but when you come into a shop that specializes in batteries and proceed to question our expertise. it's very rude in my opinion.

backstory:
i worked at a large retail box store for about a year. just recently quit for a number of reasons. i normally worked at the self checkout area as a host. my job was to watch customers and report theft. it wasn't uncommon for theft to happen. i became very good friends with the ap manager and some other managers because of this.

main story:
it's a normal day at the self checkout area. all has been calm so far and nothing to report. 

that's when she appears.

cl seemed fine at first. she had her baby with her and only had a few items. i noted that she had some baby items since those are often stolen. 

she then proceeds to place some medicine next to the scanner nearest to the bagging station. i already knew what was getting ready to happen.

sure enough, she throws it in a bag without scanning it and goes to pay. i check the main console to be sure and it's definitely not on there.

so i walk up to her as friendly as possible to let her know ""the mistake.""

me: ""excuse me ma'am, i think the machine didn't pick up one of your items.""

cl: ""oh, haha, okay go ahead. it happens to me often.""

sure it does lady.

i take the medicine out from the bag and ring it up, checking her register list to be sure it's on her receipt. 

i walk away and she begins mumbling to herself as she pays. no biggie, probably embarrassed she got caught. 

after she grabs her receipt, she turns to me, slightly annoyed.

cl: ""that medicine is on there twice so i'm going to the service desk to get my money back."" 

me: ""very well then ma'am, enjoy your day."" 

now is when it gets fun. i knew exactly what she was trying to do. fortunately you can reprint the receipt of the last purchase made on a register. so i immediately reprinted hers and contacted k.

k walks over to me to see what's going on. 

me: ""this lady with her kid in line at the service desk tried to steal some medicine and is trying to get the money back for it, claiming it's on there twice even though it's clearly only on there once.""

at this point, k was baffled. i go to continue explaining the situation further, but here comes cl looking like she's about to rip out my jugular. k slinks off immediately.

cl: ""y'know i really don't appreciate being treated like a thief in front of my own f-ing kid. i come in here all the f-ing time and i can't believe you have the f-ing audacity to treat me this way!"" 

me: ""ma'am i...""

cl: ""no!! i don't f-ing care what your w- mouth has to say....!!""

she continues to mouth off and i say nothing, walk over to the phone, and call for upper management. 

at this point i'm smug because i knew they'd have my back, but at the same time i'm just having a huge wtf moment because of cl.

m1 and m2 come up to cl and escort her loud mouth away from me, afraid she may turn violent.

k comes back and asks for the full story. i explain it all exactly how it went down. k takes her receipt and all the while cl is having a fit.

cl was on the verge of being so angry to the point of crying to m1 and m2. she claimed to be a previous manager herself for our store and couldn't believe my behavior. m1 calmly explains that it is my job to report any type of behavior i deem suspicious. all the while m2 is just as confused as i am and idles. cl is not having it and tells them she won't be returning to the store. good riddance.

after she leaves, m1 and m2 ask for my story. i explain it to them and they walk away offering words of encouragement. i just shook my head and chuckled to myself.

the icing on the cake was the kid sitting in the cart smiling and waving the whole time. poor kid.

tl;dr, crazy lady tried to steal, tried to get money back for said item, and then confronted me when i reported it to my manager. her kid was having a great time at least.",EffieLove,tfr
258,a new form of id.,"about 6 years ago, i was working in a local superstore, switching from shelf stocking and working on the checkouts. i usually got stupid questions or rude customers on an almost daily basis, but the one i am going to talk about was probably the best one i got. i was working with just the manager one evening as after a certain time, the store got very quiet, it was also a tuesday. i remember that as for some reason we never had security on shift on tuesdays. the store was actually in the middle of suburban street, so most people were local regulars, with some people who have ventured out to shop there.

&amp;#x200b;

i was working on the checkout, scanning items and all the other stuff you do when a young adult male customer (mc) and his girlfriend (gf) were the next ones to be served. they had a single bottle of alcohol (whiskey, if i remember right). i wasn't too sure and the store was notorious for mystery shoppers (i'd been caught out twice before for the pettiest of things), so i wasn't going to risk my job.

&amp;#x200b;

me: ""hey, do you have any id?""  


saying nothing, mc just pointed towards the huge window looking out to the car park. there was just a single car, a fancy bmw. i then look back to him.  


me, still being genuinely polite: ""nice car, man. but i need to see the id before i can sell you the alcohol""  


mc: ""yeah, that car is mine""  


he was actually trying to use his car as a form of id. at this point i was trying not to laugh.  


me: ""but you can legally drive at 17. that's under the age allowed to drink alcohol""

&amp;#x200b;

gf starts getting annoyed by this and decides to step in.

&amp;#x200b;

gf: ""you're just jealous because he can afford a car like that while you're working in a dead end job with low pay.""

&amp;#x200b;

me: ""i'm more of a mercedes man, myself, but a car is not a form of id, i'm afraid.""

&amp;#x200b;

i forget what was said exactly after that with it being a while ago, but it was about 10 minutes of mc and gf verbally abusing me, while i just stood there, letting it roll off of my back.

&amp;#x200b;

until, he finally gave in and showed me an id card. turned out he was about early 20's.

&amp;#x200b;

mc: ""so, how much do i owe you for the booze?""  


me: ""nothing. unfortunately, after the whirlwind of abuse you both gave me, i'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.""

&amp;#x200b;

gf: ""fuck you.""

i just laughed as they surprisingly left the store without putting up any resistance.",FearlessBookkeeper,tfr
259,we are closed don't open the doors,"so background, i am 17 at the time and this is my first job as a bagger at a chain grocery store. it's fairly popular as there are 3 other locations in a 10 minute drive and a competitor within 2 minutes away. now our store is odd and it closes at 10pm and the others of the chain mostly close at 11pm and the competitor is open 24 hours.

as i am evening shift and being a bagger my job is to collect the buggies from the parking lot and bring them inside for the night. this is the final check before i am allowed to go home and the store has been closed for around 5 minutes the automatic doors are turned off and have to be slid apart with some force. so i walk outside being sure to close the doors behind me to go grab the 3-4 buggies when half-way across the lot i turn around and watch as this old lady wedges her hands into the door and shoves them open and waltzes in like she rules the world. (note: the building was only on emergency power and could not pass as being open for business)

i almost run across the parking lot to tell her that we are closed when my manager tells her we are closed. after a bit of arguing and repeated mentions of the other stores she finally leaves. the manager then turns to me demanding to know why i left the doors open i respond that they were closed behind me when i went out and the manager huffed and stated i should be mindful to not let it happen again.",caselesshope,tfr
260,customer didn't understand how to try on shoes??????,"so yesterday i noticed this woman was standing with a ton of single shoes around her. i walked up and asked if she needed help, which she said she did. then i asked her why she only had left shoes. apparently, she thought she wasn't allowed to take the box of shoes corresponding to her shoe size in order to try both on. so, she was pulling the left shoe from the box and putting the box back on the shelf.

i explained and then insisted that she just take the box and try on both, as it makes life easier for both of us. i grabbed a box and watched her struggle to put the shoe on while standing. i told her she could feel free to sit down, as that would make it easier. she said she couldn't find a single place to sit in the whole store. now we literally have so many benches, that our regional manager is always telling us to throw a few out. i pointed behind this woman and told her she was welcome to sit there.

she didn't seem to understand why she was allowed to sit on the benches we have everywhere. i just don't get our customers sometimes....",BrokenIntoxication,tfr
261,i was what her shopping?," 

i once served a customer, older lady, lots of magazines and marked down products, the marked down labels were not printed well and wouldn't scan, and it was difficult to find the barcode on the magazines. after 5 or so minutes of reading barcode numbers and trying to find magazine barcodes that seemed to be hiding, sending broken eggs for replacement (she had missed the leaking pool of slime oozing from the box, and it wasn't marked down), and her making impatient noises i managed to get all her shopping done, give the list a quick look over and correct a price (i had put the number in correctly but the system had an extra 0 in the price, it sometimes happens), i ring her up with a smile, she pays and leaves, and i though that was the end...... wrong!

i get called up to the office about 30 minutes later and get told a customer had made a complaint, they describe the lady and i confirm i had served her, i was told to give better service and not to let it happen again or i would be in trouble, wanting to know what i did wrong i asked what the complaint was, i was told the customer didn't like me 'reading' her shopping, i still cannot believe my manager at the time took that seriously.",tiredRetailzombie,tfr
262,some people do not know how to wait their turn,"i have been a cashier for almost 6 years now and while i love my job, there are some customers that make me wonder how i managed for so long. 

i was working on wednesday morning last week and it was quieter than usual when a customer came in asking to make photocopies. she needed to zoom in on the image so it took a little longer than usual and i could not just unlock the machine and leave her at it like i would for simple copy jobs. 

meanwhile another customer comes in when we are almost done and makes his way to the counter. i let him know i would be there in a moment, i would just finish up with the copier first. first come first serve right? 30 seconds goes by and i hear a whistle, as if i was a dog. the customer had the nerve to whistle for me to serve him. the customer i was with tells me i can go serve him and that she was okay alone now. i just answered ""no, he wants to whistle at me and treat me like an animal, he can wait.""

i finish up with the copier maybe a minute later, so he was waiting all of 2-3 minutes maximum. when i get to the counter he tells me ""took you long enough readersanon"". 

me: ""i was busy with another customer""

customer: ""but i was at the cash waiting""

me: ""well you whistle for me, you can wait longer""

customer: ""oh you're getting lippy with me now?""

me: ""yep, especially when you treat me like an animal instead of a human being"" 

after this he paid for his things and left without saying anything else. i just could not believe that someone would actually whistle for someone's attention when they are obviously busy doing something for another customer. ",readersanon,tfr

264,thief found in hospital.,"strap yourselves in, it's a bit of a long one.
this happened quite a few years back so forgive me if my details are a little vague.

i was a manager in an outdoor activities store. camping/fishing/etc. and got a call at about 2am from our security company letting me know our alarm had been set off and police were waiting at the store for me.

so i make my way in and the police and i discover there has been a break in.  someone has smashed a window and entered from behind one of our display stands. they had then crawled from the far side of the store to the front counter where they had smashed open our registers.

they had then crawled back to the window they had entered , making a brief stop at the case where we store our satellite phones, stealing about $25,000 worth.

now we know they were crawling because they had cut themselves pretty badly when breaking the window. and had left a bloody trail of handprints along their path to the counter and back. we discovered the had also found the first aid kit we keep at the front counter and tried to patch themselves up.

i say tried because when the police called it in to their station,  they were informed someone had just been admitted to a nearby emergency room with severe injuries to his wrists. someone had found him unconscious about 2 blocks from our store and called an ambulance. 

turns out it was his partner in crime that called the ambulance.  he was acting as lookout while his mate did the break in.  when his buddy collapsed from blood loss, he called 000 (australia's equivalent to 911), grabbed the bag full of sat phones and ran.

we proceeded to contact the satellite phone company they located the missing phones (turns out they had a gps accurate to within 3m) and the police did their business. 

turns out the guy who got cut was out on bail for another break in crime and his dna was on record, so he probably wouldn't gave gotten far anyway.

tldr: idiot thief collapses from blood loss after cutting himself on broken window. partner got away with items that can be traced by satellite anywhere in the world.

265,"""are you trying to kill my unborn grandson?""","ok, so this one is a wild one ladies and gentlemen.. fasten your seatbelts! tl;dr at the bottom.  

this one takes place around 2 years ago, so the details and conversations are a little fuzzy, so i will be paraphrasing for a lot of this!  

**the backstory**  

i'm a young female retail manager working for a small department store in the uk, with roughly 200+ stores nationwide. quite fresh in the role, and *definitely* look younger than i am (i commonly get mistaken for under 18 years old). the store sells a range of everything, from fashion to electrical household appliances, and everything in-between. so basically, you have to be a ""jack of all trades"" and have a basic understanding of all of the goods in the store. i have worked in the store for roughly 2 years at this point, so know pretty much everything like the back of my hand.  

**the main event**  

so, from what i remember, it was just a standard day. queues were getting dealt with efficiently, customers asking the standard ""customer-y"" questions, and i'm just minding my own business, setting up a promotional event ready for the weekend near the till area of the store.  
 as i'm merchandising and trying to get the area looking spot on, i can overhear a conversation happening between a middle age lady and one of my members of staff about a vacuum cleaner that has apparently stopped working, and the lady would like a replacement for the product.  
 now, here i will mention that the store operates a year's guarantee on all electrical items sold, and anything that becomes faulty within this time will be refunded/replaced as long as proof of purchase is presented, so that we can verify that the product is within the timeframe and was genuinely purchased from our company.. (i know, really straight forward stuff)  

as i'm listening in, i can hear my member of staff repeatedly asking for her proof of purchase, with no avail. this is when i decide to swoop in and see if i can resolve the situation...  

for clarity, **st1** is the member of staff at the till, **st2** is another member of staff operating the second till, **cl** is the crazy lady with the vacuum cleaner, **pd** is her pregnant daughter. special guest appearance...**me**  

**me** &gt; ""hi there! is everything ok?""  

*the look on st1's face tells me that, in-fact, everything was not ok*  

**cl** &gt; ""yeah, well... i bought this vacuum from here and now it's not working... i want my money back.""  

**me** &gt; ""ok, let's see what we can do for you! do you have your receipt for the vacuum?""  

**cl** &gt; ""no, i don't know where i put it.. you should just be able to find it on the system. it was probably about 11 months ago""  

**me** &gt; ""right.. so unfortunately without an exact date, i won't be able to find the transaction, and even if i could i wouldn't be able to verify that it was you that made the purchase. did you pay with cash or card?""  

(if she had paid with a card, we could accept a bank statement with a date of the transaction to our company. i could then use the rough date to find the transaction of the same value and print out her receipt.. bam problem solved.)  

**cl** &gt; ""nahh... i'm pretty sure i paid cash. look, just be a *sweetheartttt* and get me my money. this one's just no good and i don't want to have to wait.""  

**me** &gt; ""ok, so unfortunately without any proof of purchase, i cannot give you any money for the faulty item. even if i wanted to, i wouldn't even be able to process it, as i don't have a product code for this vacuum. i'm really sorry, but if you were to find your receipt for the item i'd be happy to help""  

at this point, st1 is nudging me, and staring down at the vacuum incredulously. i peer down from behind the counter to take a look at it, and a small *ding* goes off in my head. i've never seen this vacuum before in my life. and, as i stated earlier, i know the stock like the back of my hand.. i smell something very fishy.  

so, against my better judgement, i decide to press a little further with this con artist.  

**me** *continuing* &gt; ""in-fact... i don't believe i recognise this brand of vacuum at all. did you purchase it from this store?""  

at this point, a heavily pregnant, waddling lady comes towards the till and stands next to the woman, who is becoming more and more agitated.  

**cl** &gt; ""of course i did, are you calling me a liar?! look, young lady, just search for the f***ing vacuum on your computer and give me my money""  

**pd** &gt; ""yeah, the box was right there! (pointing to an area just past the till) jesus christ just give her the money, we're loyal customers!""  

at this point, st2 is serving a rather lovely disabled lady who comes in the store quite often. i hear her huff and look at the two women in disgust. she gives me me a gentle nod as a small sign of ""you go girl, you can do this!""  

**me** &gt; ""ok, so there's no need to swear at me. i'm afraid i will not be doing anything further today without some proof of purchase off of yourselves. and to add, our vacuum's haven't been merchandised over there *pointing to the area pd is waving her arms at* for well over a year.""  

**cl** &gt; ""how dare you call my pregnant daughter a liar!!! i am old enough to be your grandma, where is your respect!! this vacuum began sparking at the wall and is unsafe for my grandddchilllddd.. if i walk away from here and this vacuum blew up and killed my grand baby, then you would be responsible. are you going to kill my grandson???""  

i am now absolutely dumbstruck by the monstrosity that is stood before me... st1 and st2 have moved off to one side, presumably to avoid laughing directly in this woman's face. the sweet customer is edging towards my till on her crutches, calming staring at this lady as she loses her marbles.  

**cl** &gt; ""who are you anyway???? i've never seen you here before, you obviously don't know what you're talking about. let me speak to your manager!!""  

**pd** &gt; ""yeah don't speak to my mum like that, i could have f***ing died. who are you?""  

**me** &gt; ""i'm the manager on duty, and if you don't leave right. now. then i'm calling the police. do not speak to me or my staff in that way, you're not welcome here.""  

**cl** &gt; ""fine. i'm ringing customer service and i'm going to get you fired. ring the police, i'll tell them how you tried to murder my grandson""  

so... i ring the police. as i'm on the phone, the two women prance around the store, on the phone to customer service with sh*t eating grins on their faces. i urge the police to come soon, as they're still on the property and are causing a scene, and they say that they will be there soon.. *click*  

i'm watching the pair intensely as they prance around, sitting on display stacks of drinks and basically waltzing around like they own the place. i overhear their conversation with customer service, and they must have asked what brand the vacuum was, as i hear cl spelling it out as *slowly* and as *patronisingly* as she could.  

all of a sudden... the pair stop prancing. i see cl look at pd with a look of pure embarrassment, and without a second glance, grabbed the vacuum and left the store as fast as they could, and jumped into a car parked across the road from the store. i noted down the registration and gave it to the police when they arrived.  

the lovely disabled lady spoke to me for a good 10 minutes about how absolutely despicable the two women were and how well i handled the situation, whilst st1 and st2 mocked me for being a baby killer, and we all fell into fits of laughter.  

later that day, i got curious as to why the two women left as quickly as they did.. so decided to ring customer service to get the run down of the situation.  

apparently.. customer service had gotten the electrical buyers on the phone to the woman to clarify the make and model of the vacuum. turns out...  

**it was from a totally different store!** an own brand model from a well known supermarket that we had never sold.  

i go about closing the store that day, with the **biggest** sh*t eating grin on my face.  

tl;dr - lady tries to refund a vacuum from a totally different store and accuses the staff of attempting to murder an unborn child in the process.. because logic.",20percentdisgusting-,tfr
266,sticks and stones,"i use to be a cashier at hardware store. i was at the register alone in an isolated part of the store. a customer came up the register with two orders. that’s fine because there’s no one in line. 


he starts asking me for a discount. i ask if he is military. he is not. i ask if there’s something wrong with the item. he say yea, the price. i say that cannot give him a discount. he make some off hand comment about me not being very helpful and i let it go. i rang up the first order he begrudgingly paid.


i start the second order which is 5 gallons of paint and some painting supplies. the thing about our registers is when you scan in paint you must scan a color code or type in n for not tinted. otherwise it won’t scan anything after the paint.


well that exactly what i did. i explained what had happened and started to rescan the painting supplies. the customer starts accusing me of double charging him. i explain again what happened and turned my register screen to him to show him that he had only been charged once.

268,"yeah, let me go find those exact notebooks for you thirty minutes before the store closes.","tl;dr at bottom.

i used to work at a major retail chain over summer as temporary help for back-to-school and the college dorm section. understandably, it is very busy, and quite a few people are making demands about items that we should have on the sales floor (“can you check in the back for x that your other coworkers didn’t bother to put on the shelves?”), so i try to spend as little time around that area as possible.

a father and his son walk up to me about 30 minutes before close, and believe me, they’re nice enough and polite about the whole situation, but i’m about five hours deep into my shift, and the pile of go-backs in guest services actually went up to my knees.

context here: i don’t know how it works in other places, but in my store, you didn’t get to leave for the night on the closing shift until everybody was done with their section (including go-backs), so employees usually started putting things back before the store closed.

so this kid is holding some wide-ruled composition notebooks, and the dad asks me if i can find seven more of them in that exact color. i’m sure that they were on our sales floor somewhere because people typically prefer college ruled. i scan the item, and the product description tells me the exact location. but no, of course they’re not where they’re supposed to be! and my coworker, while he’s familiar enough with the layout to clean it up pretty fast, hasn’t started on reorganizing, so i offer to go look for them in the back. 

in the manifest, i see that we had gotten a new batch of them today, and my exhausted legs are petrified at the realization that each of them had been stocked in one row on the highest shelf, meaning i had to climb fifteen feet on a ladder to get to them and all the way down with what was probably a twenty-pound box of nothing but densely packed notebooks. luckily, they’re all organized by color, but the boxes are not labelled with that information, so i had to retrieve and tear three boxes open with my bare hands to actually find the color that they were looking for. 

i update the manifest and head back out with the notebooks they ask for. the dad sees me and immediately apologizes, telling me that his kid changed his mind on the colors in the actual fifteen minutes it took me to do this for them (thank goodness for their patience). i get the exact colors he wants and head back in to get them—pretty quickly as i totally left the boxes on the ground, blocking the ladder. 

when i come back out, the kid tells me he actually wanted these colors and that his dad gave me the wrong information. i put on my best smile and hand the kid the notebooks he did want because if i didn’t, i’m sure the look on my face would have made him cry. 

i finally get these people what they want and they thank me graciously just in time for the pa system to announce that the store is closed. i’m happy that they were satisfied and that they had the patience of saints, but i was really tired, and after putting the boxes all the way back up onto their shelf, i had to get a lot of help for the go-backs.

we all got out about an hour after we usually did (clocked out around 12:30 am), and another manager pulled me into her office the next day about working for too long and having to manage my work better. i left the company about two weeks later.

tl;dr: right before the store closed, a father and son asked me for a specific notebook. stock was put in the back room in such a way that it took me twenty minutes to get them exactly what they wanted. this set me back on other tasks i had to complete before we left for the night, so i ended up clocking out about an hour later than i usually do when i work the closing shift.",blairwitchreject,tfr
269,elderly man threw his wallet at me??,"so i work in a post office inside of a drug store, and one of the services we offer allows people to send money to people in other countries. now, we have this elderly man who comes in every now and then to use the service, and every time i've had to deal with him, it's been awful, but this one particular time just sticks with me.

it was my first time dealing with this man, and the conversation started off like this.

me: hi there, what can i help you with today?

him: i'm sending money to family.

me: no problem. *pulls up program on computer* okay, can i get your phone number for that?

so he proceeds to give me his phone number, id and recipient's name for the transaction, plus all the other information needed, not making any eye contact with me at all the whole time. i process the transaction, and after a minute the receipt prints out. now the receipt is always super long, so i always fold it for the customer for convenience. however, i soon found out that for some reason, this man doesn't like his receipts folded.

me: *begins folding the receipt* okay, so the number for the transaction will be on the receipt for you—

him: no! no no! 

me: *finishes folding the receipt* sorry? 

him: you folded it the wrong way!

he then proceeds to throw his wallet at me, screaming in my face, calling me stupid and just cussing me out in front of other customers. he then began to slam his fists against the counter, screaming at me to pick his wallet up. 
now, i have really bad anxiety, so dealing with customers in general is difficult for me already, but this just sent my anxiety skyrocketing. my hands were shaking and i could barely even make out words at this point. he eventually just grabbed the receipt and his wallet and stormed out the door, still cussing me out and flipping me off on his way out. i helped the customer after with a bit of difficulty, still shaken, but she was really sympathetic, luckily.

i've only had to deal with this guy a few times after that (thank god), but any time i even see him in the store, i almost immediately go into panic. every time i deal with him, he ends up yelling at me for something. a lot of my customers are difficult to deal with, and it seems like almost every day i have at least one new story to tell, but this customer still manages to remain my least favourite for the time being.",strangeWolf17,tfr
270,wants discount for dusty item,"long time lurker, first time posting. forgive me if format isn't correct.

background: i worked in a home improvement store (use your imagination what it is) for a few years before going to a university. where i am from is a nice area. it's mainly middle class to upper middle class, but there are people in the area who are rich, i'm talking about millions of dollars. this story took place around a year into my employment so the wording isn't identical

me: me (obviously) c: customer

i was a cashier working outside in the nursery area which is by the road. because it's outside and by the road things obviously will get dirty, and while we tried to keep it clean, things got dusty really quickly.

&amp;#x200b;

while i'm manning the register a customer comes up to me with a box in her hands, well dressed in white pants and without a greeting says

c: ""i need you to dust this for me. it's absolutely filthy, i can't believe you guys allow things to get so dirty""

me: i'm biting my tongue because i see she is well dressed and i can see why she doesn't like the dust but i don't like the lack of greeting and commanding tone of voice ""hi! no problem, i'll be happy to dust it off for you. sorry about that, we dusted a few days ago, but being by the road things get dirty really quick.""

c: ""ok, well i am in a hurry so can you please dust it off quickly""

me: ""sure, give me a second"". at this point i grab paper towels and dust it off. i do the best i can but without water i can't get it all off, but it's about 90% clean, with some dust still lingering on the front where she wasn't holding it anyway. 

""okay here you go! i can ring you up out here if you want, and you can leave out here. it'll be quicker than going back inside""

c: she kind of nods so i ring her up and tell her the total. she then has the audacity to tell me (not ask, tell) ""well since it was so dirty and i had to clean it (i was biting my tongue on this one, like really i cleaned it for you) i want a discount for the inconvenience""

me: i am super dumbstruck because it's clean and there is nothing wrong with it, so i tell her ""sorry, but no. there isn't anything wrong with it, and since *i* cleaned it, it's good to go""

&amp;#x200b;

i don't remember what she said but she was super huffy about it and grumbling about how dirty it was and how inconvenient it was for her. i just bid her a good day.

271,woman tries to steal some meat by hiding it where the sun don't shine,"so i just found this subreddit today and i thought id share this story here since it is hands down the most interesting/weird/disgusting thing that ive seen while working. bear in mind that while this is only from a couple of years ago, my memory is iffy at times. on to the story.

so i used to work at a supermarket where the clients were less than classy, not really being asshats or anything, just generally couldn't care less what others thought about them. im working in my isle one day, stocking my shelves when i have a concerned customer (cc) come up to me and inform me that she saw another customer stealing and me being me, im immediately aware that im about the worst employee in this situation to tell since i can be a bit slow on the uptake at times. so i do what i usually do in situations like that and go find a co-worker who can listen to the cc and find out who the customer who is stealing is while i go and get security to confront the thief. i find him, alert him to the situation and then get back to work.

now i didn't actually see the confrontation go down but i was told about it later. apparently this older woman maybe (45-50ish) had picked up a couple of packs of pork chops and stuffed them under her dress and then tried to walk out only to be called out by security. when this happened, she lets it fall out from her dress and tries to walk out like nothing happened. i cant remember exactly what happened to her but i know she was caught and thats about it. now she was of larger build than most so thats why this was likely even possible without looking super obvious.

i still chuckle when i think how she reacted when she realized she'd been caught. i don't know what happened to the pork chops in question but even though they were wrapped in plastic wrap, id like to think they were purified with fire.

while i knew the supermarkets customers weren't exactly high class, this is a whole other level of 'if it works, it works'. not sure on the logistics of how she managed to walk while keeping the pork chops up there and whether or not she pre-planned it or just decided in the moment that stuffing meat up her dress could be a way to steal it. as to why she decided that out of all things in a supermarket to steal, pork chops were the way to go, i have no idea. while they weren't cheap, to me it seems weird to risk the potential punishment for a few pork chops but to each their own i suppose.

thanks for reading and apologies for my probably horrendous style of storytelling. feel free to ask for any clarifications in the comments and ill do my best to respond to them.

272,"ma'am, you cannot cut the merchandise!","this happened a couple of years ago when i worked at a thrift store. for a little bit of context, customers just act differently at a secondhand store than they would at a major retailer. attempts at haggling are extremely common, as well as mistreatment of items and the store. 

this particular incident involved a spanish speaking customer. i speak a little spanish, but am definitely not fluent at all. the woman spoke no english. she wanted to see a pair of scissors i had behind the counter (for sale, we just kept sharp items back there). i handed them to her and she asked me something i didn't understand. through some gesturing i understood she wanted something to test the scissors on, so i handed her some paper. no, she didn't want paper, but i couldn't figure out what she did want. she's getting frustrated at this point. 

just then another customer who spoke spanish and english overheard and let me know the woman wanted to try the scissors on fabric. oh! well, crap. i don't have any... i relay to our ""translator"" that we don't keep fabric scraps, but i will try to find her something. i go to rummage around behind the counter, and just as i look up the woman stomps to a nearby clothing rack, uses the scissors to cut the string off of a bikini top, and then turns to me with a look of satisfaction. 

i'll admit i was completely shocked and did not put my best customer service foot forward at this point. i rung up the scissors, cashed her out, and told her to just get out. she flounced out looking like she won something and i never saw her again. i lost some more faith in humanity that day.",An0therSunr1se,tfr

scene: saturday evening is a busy retail park near closing time. me on customer service; 18 years old and oblivious to the weird about to happen.... a man approaches 

me= me

wm= weird man

c= colleague 

m= manager

&amp;#x200b;

wm: excuse me, i need to exchange these shoe. \*plonks new shoes on the table\*

me: not a problem sir \*reaches for the shoes\* what's the reason for the exchange?

wm: those are the shoes i want \* gestures to the shoes i have in my hand\* it's these shoes i want to return \* i kid you not the man puts his foot on my desk and points at the shoe he's got on his foot\*

me (confused at the mans foot which is currently on my desk): the shoes you're wearing?

wm: these shoes are dangerous! the ends flick up and get caught on the peddles when i'm driving.

&amp;#x200b;

at this time my colleague has joined me behind the customer service desk and flashed me a confused look as if to say ""why is that mans foot on your desk?"" she busy's herself behind me obviously wanting to see what happens.

&amp;#x200b;

me: ok sir? do you have your receipt?

wm: no i don't, i just want to exchange these shoes \*points to the shoes hes wearing (i want to add he never takes his foot off of my desk)\* for those shoes \*points to the brand new ones on the desk\*

me: i'm sorry sir but due to the condition of the shoes you want return and with no receipt, i'm unable to do an exchange.

wm voice starts to rise

wm: these shoes \*points to his foot... on my desk!\* are dangerous.... they're... they're noddy shoes! they could cause a serious accident... they're noddy shoes.

&amp;#x200b;

c jumps in to back me up

&amp;#x200b;

c- sir these shoes are well worn and without a receipt; there isn't much we can do.

just for some context c was right these shoes have clearly been worn every day for months, the pattern on the sole was fading and they were scuffed up to the eyeballs

wm- these shoes are noddy shoes! there dangerous! ( i have no idea why he kept saying noddy shoes; i'm sure he mean't to say elf shoes... but he repeatedly kept saying noddy shoes) 

me: sir, i can call my manager if you're unsatisfied and maybe there is something they can do.

wm: yes! get me the manager

&amp;#x200b;

i call the manager and explain the situation he thought i was joking and when he realized i was being completely honest he tuts says he'll be there shortly. i turn round and the guy still has his foot on my desk! when i explain to him my managers coming he rolls his eyes and finally puts his foot down.... 

a few minutes later my manager arrives says ""what seems to be the problem sir"" and with that wm's foot is back on my friggen desk.

wm: these shoes are dangerous!!!!! they're noddy shoes, they curl up at could cause an accident! i just want to exchange this shoes \*points at his foot\* for those shoes \*points to the new pair\*

i explain that there is no receipt and my manager had a look on his face as if to say.... yep i've seen everything now... 

&amp;#x200b;

m: i'm very sorry sir; me is correct the shoes you're currently wearing are well worn and without a receipt we cannot do an exchange. i'm very sorry

mw: that's outrageous! these noddy shoes are going to cause an accident and the blood will be on your hands! \*takes his foot off of my desk\* 

m: i'm very sorry sir; you're of course more than welcome to purchase these shoes \*gestures to the new shoes on the desk\* and i can give you head offices number if you're not satisfied

mw: i'm not spending any more money in this shop! this an complete outrage! you can see they bend up and you can see how dangerous these shoes are outrageous!!!

my manger says sorry again; with a slight shrug and is if to say those are your options pick your poison. mw stands for a few moments before realizing he's not getting rid of his ""noddy shoes"" and walking out with a new pair. he huff's, says again how outrageous this was and walks away...

&amp;#x200b;

m: well that was definitely an odd one

me: yep that was pretty weird for me too!

m: chuckles and walks away.

&amp;#x200b;

though that happened a good few years ago now... that whole experience is etched into my brain because of how insanely strange is was... when i train new people on tills this is the story i always tell them because it was just... so.... weird...

274,when did charity become picky?,"hiya everyone, quick background info, i work in a supermarket in the uk, the department i work in is either checkouts/ kiosk. this story goes back a couple of months ago when it was the christmas period. on this occasion i was working in the kiosk. 

in our store we have a food bank trolley,as it was christmas a lot more people were donating to it. 

so, i’m in the kiosk (ages away from the foodbank trolley btw) and it’s just the start of my shift, of course as i’ve just started my shift for the day i’m being overly nice to customers. i serve this women and the way she looks at me has already got me regretting even greeting her with a smile. 

she explains she’s here to collect from the food bank and she’s not happy with the things getting put into the trolley. i didn’t even get the chance to ask her what before she started her rant, she told me she’s left multi packs of water in the trolley as they can just use the taps and that they are in no need of that much water?! and multi packs of energy juice were getting left as her clients don’t like energy drinks? 
i told her i would pass her message on to a manager but because it was customers donating to it we couldnt exactly do much, she left without even saying bye. as expected management were pretty annoyed when i told them about her because how ungrateful and rude right?

275,soda struggle.,"so, i’m somewhat certain there was a language barrier issue and that’s what caused this whole ordeal. 

customer a: woman buying soda.

customer b: woman wondering of it’s price. 


beforehand, customer a barely spoke english. i know this because earlier, she had asked me while i was putting up price tags, if i spoke spanish. almost in a quiet and soft spoken tone. i did not so i found a coworker who did. 

she was purchasing a two liter of ginger ale. customer b noticed the soda and and politely asked how much it was. a, seemed oblivious to this question. 

this was after the fact that customer a had purchased it. so, we try to convey to customer a, that b would like to know the price but she already has the bottle, so scanning it to find the price would not take more than three seconds, she wasn’t understanding. 

the bottle was placed on the platform and she wasn’t holding it yet, but refused to get what we were trying to get her to understand. 

so i probably shouldn’t have done this, but i carefully took the soda and tried to run a price inquiry on the register. customer a, didn’t like that, and though i was trying to steal her soda or something. 

“aye, mira, no!” a yelped. snatching the bottle up! so it’s obvious it’s not gonna work like that. while b is just watching this still at the register. a had enough of this and just takes her soda and leaves. b says that was rude of a , then saying how everyone is so touchy and impersonal today, something along those lines. then b goes off into the soda aisle to get it. 

meanwhile later on i’m ringing up customers and b has found the soda but up at the front is asking me where the sugar is, while i’m in the middle of a transaction. i tell her where to go and she finds it. 

i don’t know if a really was rude, it was more than likely the fact that she didn’t understand english all that well...",CanadianDeathMetal,tfr
276,man steals high value vehicle for a charity shop jacket.,"i would first like to say that this story comes from my mum, who works in a charity shop in greater london. also i’m on mobile so i got bad formatting. 

cp: crazy person

my mum sees a man walk into the shop and acting weird. he takes a few things, as you do. but my mum see cp take a jacket and put it on. when cp comes to the counter to pay for his crap. my mum rumbles him and remarks his jacket by saying: “you paying for that too?”  

cp acts surprised and pays for his stuff, tell my mum he will get some money, leaves the jacket, and exits the store. 

about 30-60 mins later my mum hears sirens and helicopters. doesn’t think much as this is a busy high street in london. 

but later, after about 3 hours, 2 police officers come in and described cp, asking if he was here. my mum said yes, then asked why they were asking. 

they didn’t say much, but she eventually found out that what cp meant by “get some money” was stealing a money-truck for a bank, going  on a bit of a joyride, and getting arrested.

277,get the scissors.,"work in clothing retail. one evening about 6pm we noticed a guy cutting a tag off a pair of adidas shoes. he put them on and dumped his old shoes in the box and continued (browsing?). anyway we picked up the box with his shoes in and took it to the front. informed our manager and waited. police won’t always show up if they haven’t physically taken the stock out the building and since we had his shoes he wasn’t about to change back. 

so we waited outside and just around the doors for a good 15 minutes waiting for the bloke to leave. eventually he was just hovering by the door and could see us all. he finally stepped out the building and security dragged him back in and we detained him in the changing rooms. all normal up to now. 

however after the police was called my manager at the time was not happy. we’re a store that’s quite tough on shoplifters anyway and most of the time not a lot gets done about it. so he asks me to brings a pair of scissors to him. 

during the next 5 minutes he proceeds to cut up the laces and stab a hole in the side of the shoe, in what i can only describe as a mad frenzy. 

eventually the police arrive and we escort them to the changing room. they take the shoes off him and ask if we still have his pair. we pass it over and he spends the next few minutes handcuffed, trying to tie up cut laces and his shoes were well damaged beyond repair. english was not his strong point so he couldn’t really complain about it. police didn’t seem to notice or care. had many shoplifters in my time but nothing quite as funny as seeing that bloke dragged out in destroyed shoes.

a man comes up to my window, doesn't respond to me greeting him, sets a coke on the counter thing and just looks back down at his phone, not only ignoring my existence but avoiding looking at me at all. 

""will that be it for you?""

no response. maybe he didn't hear me for some reason. 

""will that be it for you tonight?""

still no response, not even any form of eye contact or acknowledgement. just standing there looking at everything in existence but me. i'm getting pretty offended but trying to remain customer servicey, so i raise my voice to a low key holler like i'm talking to an older person. 

""is that going to be it for you tonight?""

he finally looks up for maybe a second like he just noticed someone was in front of him and ever so slightly nods ""yes"" to my general direction while typing on his phone and blatantly ignoring me. 

""alright, it'll be 2.06""

no response. at this point i just want him gone. 

""did you want debit or credit?""

no response. he's getting credit. 

before i even pass him the receipt, he's walking away still without saying a word to me. good riddance.

279,being nice = free drinks!,"got plenty from over the years, but here's one about the time being nice scored me some free drinks at the club.

so i work in retail liquor, and a few years ago i was busy being bored out of my skull on a slow saturday afternoon in a small store.

finally after nearly an hour between customers, a young gentleman walks in and attempts to purchase a six pack of pre-mixed bourbon and cola cans. i check his id(policy is to check anyone who looks under the age of 25), he was 22, everything's cool. tell him the price is $22, his face drops.

c: i've only got a $20 on me.

turns out he was on his way home(another 20 minutes away) after a day at the beach with his mates, and all he had in his pockets was his id, car keys and $20. we had a small jar where we kept loose change we found in store, so i thought i'll be nice.

m: no worries mate, found $2 on the floor earlier, i'll chuck it in for ya.

his grin cracked his face as he thanked me, and shook my hand vigorously before leaving.

so i close up after a couple of hours, go home, get changed and hit the town with my mates. feeling good, few drinks in me, when suddenly i hear a shout.

c: bottle-o(in australia, liquor shops are nicknamed ""bottle-o's"") guy!

he comes over and shakes my hand again, and asks me what i want to drink. turns out he had won a jackpot on the poker machine(slot machine), was quite drunk, but remembered i had let him off earlier in the day. so for the next couple of hours(until he got kicked out for being too drunk), he bought me a few more drinks and kept thanking me for my generosity.

281,i'm a liar and thief because i can't provide a free service?,"when i was in my mid-to-late teens, i worked part-time at my parents' gas station. i was incredibly shy and easily intimidated, especially in the beginning. 

early in my career, i was dropped off for work by my mom. i noticed my dad was very occupied on the phone, but didn't ask why, though it meant i was mostly on my own, even though i didn't know much about car care at the time besides pumping gas and washing windows. also, there was a strange girl hanging around, probably not much older than me, who kept hunkering down by the side of the road, avoiding us. this was a rural area and the gas station was located by a busy highway. but i had customers to take care of, especially since dad was still busy on the phone.

so an elderly woman pulled in who seemed to have a sour frown permanently etched on her face. she snapped that she wants 10 gallons of gas ""not dollars, 10 gallons"" she reiterated which is weird because that will make the total come out uneven, but oh well. she also asked me to check the air in her tires. i hadn't used an air gauge nor the air pump yet, but i was sure my dad would handle it.

i pumped her 10 gallons of gas, then ran inside the station to ask my dad to check her tires. my dad was no help, though, since he was still on the phone and was quite sour at the moment himself. so i blithely trotted back to the old lady and told her the wonky gas total and apologized that i didn't know how to check tires and no one else was available.

much to my shock and horror, the old lady sneered and called me a liar and a thief. she says she only came to our station to get her tires checked, and because i knew no one could do it (i didn't, i thought dad could), i ""stole"" her money even though i provided her 10 gallons of gas. she paid for the gas and tore off in a huff.

still in shock at a complete stranger calling me a liar and a thief, i ran to the restroom and cried my eyes out. i finally pulled myself together and went back into the station to tell my dad who was finally off the phone. he apologized for sending me out knowing that the old lady was a royal bitch. he told me she owns her own gas station about 10 miles away from ours, but she refused to pump her own gas.

in the meantime, a car pulled up to the pumps, and the strange girl jumped in and they took off without a word. turns out they were tourists from california who forgot their daughter while she was in the restroom. my dad had been on the phone with state police trying to track her parents down, while she sat and sulked on the side of the road where my dad was afraid she was going to get splattered by a semi. the final sting was that her family just drove off without a thanks for watching their kid and all the stress the whole debacle caused.

i didn't think i'd see the old lady again, but she came into the station looking for stp fuel additive or something of the like. she griped that it was too expensive. i meekly suggested the sports and auto store where we bought the stuff. she huffed off, but eventually came back and bought the additive from us. i can only assume the drive to the nearest store wasn't worth the time or gas? at least i wasn't called a liar or thief this time.",KatBlackadder,tfr
282,women's room wacko,"hello all. this literally happened tonight during my closing shift. 

quick background info. i am a supervisor at a gas station which is linked to a large retailer store. 

the shift was going quite well for the most part. i was going about my normal closing/cleaning duties when i noticed that there was someone still in the women's room. i asked my co-worker how long she had been in there and he told me that she had been in there for at least 20 minutes. we were standing nearby and i heard what sounded like a syringe falling on the ground inside the room. we didn't think much of it as we didn't know for sure what i heard was what i thought it was. i figured she was just having a bad case of the runs and would exit eventually.

after another 30 minutes i had gotten my cleaning cart and i go to clean the restrooms. i get the men's room cleaned in 7 minutes and i go to check the women's room. i knock and ask if anyone is in there. i hear a very hoarse ""yes"" and i go to work on another job to save time as we were running behind on our cleaning schedule. after 5 minutes i walk over to my co-worker and tell him that she was still in the restroom. he looks at me surprised and tells me that i should check to see if she is alright. 

not wanting to actually go into the room as i am a young man and i don't know what may be going on in there i knock on the door again and ask if she is alright. the response: ""yes"" in the same hoarse, rough, voice. but this time i can hear what sounds like her moving a trashcan around she was also talking to herself in low mumblings. this raises even more suspicion and i quickly text my assistant manager as she lives nearby and i give her the details. she responds in less than a minute saying she is on her way.

5 minutes later she arrives and she and my older co-worker go over to the restroom and she enters while my co-worker stays outside. within 2 minutes he is walking back saying that she told him to get the police over there asap. after he calls the authorities i spot the woman hurriedly leaving the restroom with my assistant manager right behind her. the woman leaves the store and begins to wander around the parking lot. my manager stays nearby and watches where the woman was walking.

the officer was still not there and the woman was walking as fast as she could away from the store. from what i saw and the way she was walking we all knew she was certainly on something quite strong. the officer arrives just as the woman disappears out of sight into the darkness. the manager and officer go into the restroom to examine it for any possible evidence. the officer had already called in the woman's possible location so he knew he could take some time and search the restrooms. my manager told the officer that when she went into the restroom the woman quickly began to gather up her kit in the stall and clean up after herself (she almost did a better job than some of my co-workers do) so the officer doesn't find much other than a piece of bandage that we assumed she had used to tie her arm to inject the drugs. 

after a few minutes the officer gets back into his patrol car and starts the search for the druggie as it is rather cold and we all knew that the woman definitely seemed off her rocker and could possibly do something even more stupid. 

i haven't heard anything more about the case yet and i may never know. if i do get some more info i will add it here. until now the strangest thing i had found in the restrooms was empty shooter bottles and a used catheter. i know that some of you other gas station employees have crazier stories but this is in a very nice city and in a good neighborhood. we don't normally have to deal with this sort of thing. which is fine with me. the less i have to deal with the druggies the better.",Goldstartankexpert,tfr
283,customer takes us to trading standards for not giving replacement on food he had already eaten.,"this is a long one, so bear with me.

quick bit of background for those of you who don't know what a cheese straw is, its basically a thin strip of pastry with cheese in it that is cooked and eaten as a snack.

&amp;#x200b;

anyway, on with the story.

&amp;#x200b;

a customer comes in and buys five cheese straws, we warn him that straws will still be red hot as they have just come out of the oven, in fact, the baker was taking them out of the oven as he was served. he thanks us for the warning, pays and then leaves the shop. five minutes later he returns to the shop, didn't think much of it, as often with cheese straws people will come back and buy more. however, not this time.

&amp;#x200b;

he places the bag of cheese straws and asks for some alternatives because there was an issue with the taste. confused, i pick up the bag and ask what the issue is, as i look in the bag i notice two have already been eaten as he replies 'they are too hot and too cheesy.' after a brief pause, i apologise and say that as he has left the store and eaten nearly half theproduct there is nothing i can do, especially as we had notified him that they had just come out of the oven which he had acknowledged. he starts to get annoyed so i call over the person in charge that day. the customer explains the situation again and the supervisor explains that as there is technically nothing wrong with the food and that he has eaten two of them we cannot replace them, besides the other cheese straws we had left were all from the same batch.

&amp;#x200b;

customer starts ranting at us (can't remember the whole thing he said as it was a month ago now) but it was something along the lines of  'i'm never coming into this fucking (company) again. your head office will hear about this.' this is a threat we hear a lot so none of us took it too seriously. however, we did ring head office just to notify them that the situation had happened.

&amp;#x200b;

less than 2 minutes later, i left the shop to do our banking, and who should i see up the road? yep, the customer, eating the rest of the cheese straws. obviously there was not an issue with them, he was just trying to get a freebie out of us. as soon as he saw me, he hid the bag. i smiled to myself and went back to work, to tell my coworkers what i had just witnessed and then thought nothing more of it.

&amp;#x200b;

the next day

arrived at work to find an area manager there. a complaint had been put in about the cheese straws and how we all apparently rude to the customer. once we had all spoken to the area manager, and i had explained that the customer had eaten all the cheese straws after the incident, we were told we had done nothing wrong and no action would be taken against any of us.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm presuming that the customer was told that no other action was taken because the next thing i heard later that week was that the owner of the company had ended up having to ring the customer and asked them outright what flavour they expected cheese straws to be, because there was literally nothing wrong with the cheese straws from that batch (as a precaution our company will taste test a batch if a complaint is put in, and guess what, nothing wrong), customer ended up having a go at the owner and threatening to take us to trading standards. we laughed it off.

&amp;#x200b;

big mistake. because guess who got involved. trading standards, who, coincidentally, also were perplexed as to the complaint, but they had to follow it through. needless to say, they ended up doing nothing other than eating some free cheese straws and telling the customer to stop wasting our, and their time.

&amp;#x200b;

best part is, this complaint all stems from an item that cost £1 at most.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr- customer bought cheese straws, complained they were too cheesy after eating half of them, got pissed that we wouldn't replace them, ended up complaining to trading standards who told him where to go.",QuickPercentage,tfr
284,"yes, because that makes it better","short and not so sweet.

so despite teaching us that we should cover our mouths when we cough or sneeze, a lot of adults (even people bringing kids with them don't listen). i've had many a time at work backing away from the register because people will straight up cough as if it's as automatic as breathing. one experience takes the cake from the rest.

so this was sometime during the cold months, either right before winter started or during. i'm just scanning this lady's stuff and she coughs. i hesitate and move to the side a little. a little bit of time passes and she coughs without covering her mouth yet again. she notices my hesitance and says words i will never forget:

""oh don't worry, i don't have the flu!"" in a bubbly tone.

so not only was i upset but i was confused. why would i think you have the flu? if anything now i'm worried. and it didn't matter what you had. if you're coughing that much, you're probably sick. and i may never see you again, but if i get sick then other people have to deal with the mess you made. people will come near me sick (i've literally had someone say they weren't good because they *currently* had the flu) but as soon as i have a mask to show i'm sick, people walk away.

i just don't get how adults can teach you something they ignore in their older age.",PlottyTheAnimator,tfr
285,you are not allowed to stock the product i want!,"for context: i work in a medium sized grocery store and this story happened last summer when it was really hot where i live.

so fortunately corporate had decided we would be getting pallets of bottled water twice a day because of the heat (we normally get them once a day), so we'd get bottled water in our 6am truck and in our 3pm truck. but the demand was so high we'd often be out of water for a couple hours while we were waiting for the next truck.

this particular morning some dumbass at our dc had decided that he'd leave our pallets of water behind at the dc because the truck was full and yeah, why'd you need water when it's super hot.... we had been out of water since 7pm the day before because the demand was so extremely high, so obviously we promised everyone it'd be there the next day and we all got kinda grumpy when it didn't come in in the morning.

obviously every single customer had been asking for water since we opened, but finally at 3pm our truck arrived and we could restock our water. i immediately grabbed a pallet jack to move the pallet to our water aisle, which unfortunately is on the opposite end of the store. 

i walked into the store and expected all customers to be super happy that we finally got water in, because, you know, literally every single customer asked for it that day. i try to move the pallet very carefully to not bump into anyone, but because it was very busy i had to stop and say: excuse me sir, i'm sorry every 1.5 seconds... most people were ok with this, some were sighing but one customer was the worst.

this guy had specifically asked me 10 minutes earlier if we had water, so i explained the situation and said: probably in 10 minutes but not right now. as i'm walking across the store i have to pass him and i hear him complaining to his wife about why the employees here think they can just do whatever they want and move pallets when there's obviously no room whatsoever. i overheard this and told him in a friendly manner: well, i brought this water here for you, i just have to stock it and then you can get some. but what does this guy say: well this is so rude of you, you and your managers can obviously see it's way too busy to be moving pallets right now, i can't understand why you didn't do this before opening,  you are troubling all your customers with this, let me speak to a manager right now. 

at this point i was like: ok not dealing with you anymore and i took my pallet to the water aisle and them got my manager, who explained to the guy that this was the only option we had to get water on the floor, but of course this guy pulled the whole 'i'm never shopping here anymore' trick, so my manager told him to have a nice day, and continued his work. 

the guy still comes here every day like he did before and i still don't understand how people an be like this...

286,pee cup,"3 years ago, university student and desperate need for a job. clothing store. only place that would hire me last minute. 

i’ve been working for 3 months and i feel like i’ve dealt with everything because the store handled 300-600 people coming in every hour which is normal for a popular clothing store in the epicentre of downtown. it was christmas eve and people are dashing for last minute presents and stocking stuffers. eager adults looking for a holiday deal and teens window shopping.

 i was stationed at a corner full of trendy clothes beside the cash register. i was very lucky i was friendly with the manager on shift because i’m usually the clothing mule that transports bundles of 20-30 hung clothing upstairs to our second floor. the only reason i accepted it was because i didn’t want to talk to people and would rather transport clothes. 

it’s now 4 pm and people coming off work, classes are done and people are scrambling to get their life together for christmas. our entrance door was constantly being held open by customers trying to get in and out, people asking for help on the best gift and little kids running around. it’s hectic because each step you take while on the floor, another person asks for something. 

i had one lady tell me i should discount something because it was not in the colour green. i said “it doesn’t come in green at any other location”. she looked at me and shouted “you don’t know anything about your job”. i shrugged and walked away. 

now its getting late around 7 pm. i decide to take my 30 min break. i come back upstairs onto the main floor and i see my manager scrambling asking other staff. it turns out a team of 3-5 people stole 40 pairs of shoes and left the magnetized security tags on the shelf. 

now its 9ish pm and the line to the fitting room is 8-12 ppl long and people are taking their sweeeeet stinky time to change. one lady had such a bad foot odour it permeated through the other stalls causing 5 people to constantly complain. i had to hold my breath every time i went to collect returned clothes for my section. my record was 30 seconds lol. 

a pregnant lady asked if we can reserve a change room so she can go to the washroom we have. “staff only mam”. she threw a mini fit but tough luck its a security concern for us at the end of the day. she proceeds to take her 15 items and two toddlers into the change room with her. 

we officially close at 10 but let the last customers take their time wrapping it up. the pregnant mom takes half of her clothes and dumps it on the floor the other half was just strewn on hooks and chairs. she dashes out quickly with kids in  tow. 

10 mins later~ 

“ewww wtf is that ?!?!!whyyyyyyyyy??” 

“im not cleaning that up or i quit right now” 

everyone on the floor scrambles to fits and wonder what da heck could happen at closing. 

besides all the clothes scattered everywhere it was a styrofoam cup on the floor in the corner full of pee. that christmas i vowed to myself i would do everything to avoid working in clothing retail ever again. i quit 1 month later because of bad management. 

now its a great story to tell during christmas when everyone is having a great time and enjoying the funny situations we all go thru in some way or another. ",mangokango23,tfr
287,my husband is a policeman,"this is a story from my dad from a few years back. my dad runs his own shop and he is very nice and polite to customers.

so we sell luggage. most luggage are a set of 3 (l, m and cabin size) but we have one or two different ones. it's a set of 4 since it has an xl.

the customer bought one, asking for a medium size. therefore my dad sold her the regular medium size from the set of four. she bought happily and left with it.

she rolled it for almost 3 hours, in the mall, and returned.

lady(l) : this is not a medium size.

dad (d) : it is the medium size (in france medium size are usually around 63cm which it was). 

l: no. the medium size is this one *points to large* because it has a size above it. 


d: it's a set of four so of course you can find a size above it but since you said it is not, i will let you change it for another. but please know that i could have refused the exchange because you've rolled it for so long. i will have to sell it with a discount because you rolled it.

l: sure. so sell me the 'medium size' *points to large*

d: okay. but you need to pay the difference because this one is more expensive.

l: what? no. you sold me the wrong one so i ain't paying.

d: miss, this one is more expensive. you need to pay the amount to reach the price.

l: no. i won't pay this. it's your fault so you pay it.

d: as i said, you asked me for the medium. i sold you the one that is a medium - you can see it from the other regular sets- but you don't find it big enough. so i am letting you change it even though you rolled so much the wheels have traces of glass and meshed rocks, but lady, i'm not giving you a bigger size without payment.

l: my husband is a cop. if you don't let me walk away with this, i'll call him.

my dad is asian. he has papers but like many immigrants, he dislikes the involvement of police force. nonetheless, at that time, the way she spoke was basically saying it like she was going to call the equivalent of ice in france on him.

d: *yells* have you heard? her husband is a policeman so she can walk away without paying. tomorrow, sarkozy's wife comes and i'm gonna give her my business.

at that time, sarkozy was the president in france but the simple fact he yelled that made the lady pay and leave without any other word.

honestly, if i was in his spot, i'd have told her to call her husband. after all, i would have loved to copy his badge number and talk about it at the station. that is if her husband was actually a policeman.


side note: lots of policemen families or friends of policemen feel like threatening to call their police friend is a good call. ***it isn't***",Laiyah,tfr
288,the sign says it's on the end!,"so my mom works at a grocery store part time aside from her full-time job and she loves it (for the most part). she was standing with the co-worker and manager when this happened. recently it was fastnacht day and this customer comes in looking for some syrup specifically for fastnacht day.

289,no this is the right receipt!,"this is going to be a long one and i hope this my first post will be enjoyable to the readers because after 2 years it's still fun to talk about (to me at least).  


i used to work in a clothing store as a cashier. in this store a manager has to be present when the cashiers return items. they have to input their own passcodes in order to bring up a return screen before the cashiers can actually do the return. idk why but that is how it is. meanwhile, i can check to see if the item is returnable by asking the customer for their receipt, credit card, etc.  


so one afternoon the customer, a woman in her mind fifties(i'll call her c), came over to the register with a bag which i could immediately tell means that she wants to do a return. i was right. i thought this would be simple; i did returns before. i ask if she had a receipt. she handed me one and i checked if the item on the receipt matched the pants she was returning. you could tell by looking at the sku number on the price tag. this was where the story begins. the sku number did not perfectly match the one printed on the receipt. it was off by one number at the end. this meant she got the same pants, but it differed by 1 size. this was where the story begins.   


i told her that this was the wrong receipt and asked if she had another pointing out that the products she bought doesn't match. she told me this was the right receipt which confused me greatly. then one of my managers(m1) came and asked what is wrong. i told her the discrepancy on the receipt and w explained. apparently she exchanged the pants for another size and my coworker who did the exchange(cw) that time told her that she could use the same one if she wanted to return it. it was not possible as we were trained to staple the old and new receipts together during the exchange in case customers wanted to return the exchanged item and cw stick to the rules. we explained it to her, but she was having none of it.  


i could see m1 was done with c and was starting to process the return. but, when the receipt was checked in the system, the item listed was already returned to the store. so, we couldn't return the item with the 'receipt', but we could still give c store credit for the pants. c didn't want store credit; she wanted a cash refund. she insisted that this was the receipt given to her. 

&amp;#x200b;

c's insistence that this is the right receipt was driving a lot of the staff mad including c herself. i was carefully trying to process the return as m1 talked to c. c started cursing in spanish which i couldn't understand, but m1 can! and she snapped back.    


m1:""no i am not from dr. i know spanish because i'm educated.""  


you can guess what c was saying that time.   


this went on for a good 2 minutes. now we have a crowd and my other manager(m2) came in diffuse the situation. she did not diffuse it.  
c tried to explain the same thing to m2. i think because she was so riled up, in the middle of this she shoved the receipt in m2's face(the piece of paper was a few cm away from m2's nose) and threw the pants at me. m2 got mad at her for me for some reason then she was mad because c took the pants i placed back on the counter to show m2 the sku before throwing the pants back down. m1: ""excuse me, you don't treat merchandise that way"". yeah, she was getting upset too. meanwhile, i was like a deer in headlights. stone faced, i kept my mouth shut and let the older staff do the talking as i try to process what was supposed to be a simple return.  


in the end we could only give her store credit which she accepted. ""finally!"" i thought and though there was a few kinks there (she would not provide her information which is just there in case she wanted to return another item. ~~let's hope not.~~) m2 printed the store credit for c to use on future purchases. however, the sage of c was not over. c reached over the counter (the full arch) to forcefully take it off m2's hands and m2 reeled back in surprise. c: ""give it to me!"" m2 slowly handed the credit(while saying something about manner) to c who snatched it out her hand and here is the grand finale:  


c literally tore the credit into little fragments front of everybody. 2 pieces, 4, pieces, 8 until all you saw were fat sprinkles. she left the remains on the counter before cursing everybody out and leaving.   


wow. just wow. we laughed it off and everyone went back to their tasks. i sweep the credit off into the trash and helped the next, more sane, customer who joked about the scene she witnessed.   


what a day.  
the next time i met cw i told her what happened and as expected she denies saying that to the customers. i think the consensus was c lost the receipt and tried to use the old one instead. it doesn't work like that sadly.  


tldr; customer tried to return something with the wrong receipt and blows up when she couldn't. chaos ensures.",no_nooo_nope,tfr
290,"""why do you have to eat?"" stories of my seasonal cashier jobs - part 1 -","okay, english isn't my native language so apologies in advance. i have lots of these stories so i'm going to divide every each of them.

first, a little bit of backstory. i live in a small town in turkey. a seasonal town, very crowded in summertime. job opportunities are mostly only seasonal, like 4 months maybe 5 months top. last summer i was hired as a seasoned cashier at a large market. it was so crowded. i worked there before but for the first time i saw that it was so crowded. i can't even breath.

as cashiers we often took breaks because when you get tired and confused, you can give out the money more than you should've. (idk how to translate that, i'm trying to say that you can give more money accidently and when you do that it comes out of your pocket basically)

we usually work with 12 cashier desks and 25 cashiers and we constantly relocate each other and send each other to breaks so we can stay focused. you get the idea.

so, this particular day, it was like hell. lunch breaks are delayed due to crowd, all the cashiers are basically running around to get cigarettes etc. we're dying. our cashier chef comes and hung the warning message thingy to close my cashier desk so i can go for my lunch break and another cashier replaces me. people who waiting in line were not happy but they had to leave, so they did. i took a deep breath and got up, just turned my back to go. at this point i'm 5 minutes away from fainting.

some crazy woman basically yelled at me and i froze immediately. i turned around and this woman is standing in front of the signboard with products in hand. conversation continues as follows. (cb is standing for crazy bitch btw not choosing beggar)

&amp;#x200b;

me: did you yell at... me? (i was shocked, everyone was staring at us and i hadn't done anything wrong at all)

cb: where do you think you are going?

me: um... i'm taking a lunch break? another cashier will come and open here if you can wait a minute...

cb: \*checks the time\* what lunch? it's 4 p.m?

me: yeah, it's crowded i didn't have time to eat. so... (i tried to turn around and go away. big mistake)

cb: where are you going? open here now! \*throws a wafer on my back\* \*everyone gasps\*

me: what the...

cb: here, eat that wafer.  you don't have to eat anyway. you're already fat enough. sit down and do your work.

an old man waiting at the other line approached the woman.

om: lady, what are you doing? stop this. she's tired. you're embarassing yourself.

cb: i want to talk to your manager! now!

me: \*rolls eyes\* yeah, sure. whatever you say.

cashier chief comes to the noise.

cc: i told you to go to lunch ten minutes ago, why are you still here?

me: \*waved my hand towards cb\* this customer said i shouldn't eat and kept me here.

old man: she threw a wafer at your employees back and told her to eat that. these spoiled women these days smh.

me: yeah that too.

cc: what's the problem ma'am?

cb: other lines are too long. i do not want to wait, open here and get my job done otherwise i will write a complain letter about every single one of you.

cc: if i don't fix the needs of my cashiers -especially those are starving- i can't sleep at night. you are free to write your complaint. now, please go to the other queue or leave the store.

291,dude kills his lawn cause i don’t know what i’m talking about.,"tl;dr at the bottom. 

so i worked at a hardware store specifically in the garden section. one of the most common things that we sold in this section was weed killer. since it was a popular item, i took it upon myself to learn the basic differences between all the different brands. i got pretty good at it and it became my favourite thing to sell. for this story you’ll need to know only 2 different brands. so brand #1 was our most popular since it actually works. however, it doesn’t just kill the weeds. it kills everything. if the weeds were popping up between concrete or rocks then it’s the perfect brand to use. if the weeds were on the grass you’d definitely not want to use it since it’d kill the grass and even the soil under it. you wouldn’t even be able to grow new grass in any of those areas. so if you had weeds on grass you’d go with brand #2 which doesn’t kill your grass. unfortunately, it doesn’t kill the weeds either so it was pretty useless. i know this from actually using it myself and from coworkers and countless customers telling me. due to this i would always tell customers with weeds on grass that brand #2 is the best we have but i’d always tell them that it doesn’t work. i didn’t want anyone wasting their money on a bad product. almost every customer i had appreciated my honesty and even thanked me for not letting them waste their money. this was not one of those customers. 

i was working a normal shift when i saw a customer looking at the weed killer. i approached him and asked if he needed any help. this is roughly how it all went down. 

me: hi, do you need any help?

him: yeah, do you know which weed killer is good?

me: yeah i do, so where are your weeds located?

him: in my back yard. 

me: oh okay, are the weeds on top of your grass?

i’ve asked a total of 2 questions and already he looked real annoyed with me. 

him: uh yeah? 

me: okay then brand #2 would be your best bet but honestly, it doesn’t really work. 

him: what? why not?

me: well i actually used it before and it killed like 2 weeds. 

this guy starts getting very irritated and starts getting mad. i try to keep up my friendly customer service voice but in my head i’m annoyed af. 

him: did you even use it right?

me: it was actually my dad who used it and i’m pretty sure he followed the instructions. 

him: pretty sure? 

me: well a lot of customers have told me it doesn’t work too. you can try it out for yourself if you want but it would honestly be a waste of money. 

him: *sigh* okay then what about this brand? 

i look and see that he’s pointing at brand #1

him: my friend told me it’s good. 

me: oh brand #1? yeah it’s good but not for your situation. 

him: why?

me: it’s a really strong product. it’d kill your weeds but it’d also kill your grass. 

him: i can just put new grass seed after, right?

me: that actually wouldn’t work. brand #1 will kill the soil. 

him: kill the soil? okay you don’t know what you’re talking about. how old are you?

i was 19 at the time but honestly looked more around 16. a lot of people asked me my age when i worked here thinking i didn’t know anything. happened way too often. 

me: i’m 19. 

him: can you get me someone older? someone with more experience?

now i had been working there for almost a year at this point and i’d say i’m quite experienced. especially with the weed killer. there was only one other garden employee with me and he was much older than i was. he was pretty new, only been working there for a few weeks but he was “older” so i found him and asked him to help a customer by the weed killer. i watched from afar as they talked for a few minutes. the customer finally picked up a jug of brand #1 and walked off. out of curiosity i asked my coworker how it went. basically the customer said he’d just plant new grass seed if his grass died and my coworker said it’d work. my coworker didn’t know and i don’t blame him. even i didn’t know about soil rot until my manager told me. anyways, i told him about soil rot and continued my shift. 

a couple weeks later i had a shift with one of my closer coworkers and she told me about an extremely rude customer that she had the other day. a very angry man came in telling her how he used brand #1 in his yard and it killed his grass and the grass seed he planted still hasn’t grown. he even showed pictures of his extremely patchy grass. she told him exactly what i said about how the soil dies. he was really mad since he was told by my other coworker that the grass would grow. luckily that coworker wasn’t working that day. i don’t know all the details but apparently he was talked to the manager as well. the dude really should’ve listened to me but it’s whatever. i just wish i could see how bad his backyard looked. 

tl;dr
guy thought i didn’t know anything about my job and ended up using weed killer that killed a bunch of the grass in his backyard. ",ProbablyJalen,tfr

293,a shoplifting incident made me think the fbi was ready to arrest me.,"this is my first post. tl;dr at the bottom

&amp;#x200b;

i used to work at chain pharmacy/convenience store. my job for that day was to help unload the delivery truck and bring down pallets to unpack. this is all done in a shared alleyway near the store's backdoor. before the truck arrives, i have to organize the alley, by stacking milk crates, putting garbage in the dumpster, and asking neighboring business owners to move their parked cars . i do all this before the truck arrives and i go wait in the break room. our lp guy (loss prevention) comes to the brake room with a suspect and he asks me to leave. and i do, but not before looking at the alleged shoplifter. he's huge. about 6'5 and at least 300lbs. he was bigger than the lp guy who's about 5'10 and just over 200lbs. the suspect looked calm and understood what was happening. so i'm near the back door to the alley (still inside) talking to my partner who's gonna help with the truck. he opens the door because he has the security keys to silence the alarm. ten minutes later we hear a loud bang and then a crash coming from the break room. we look confused. then we see the suspect coming around the corner fighting off two police officers. they had their batons/nightsticks out, hitting the guy's body.  meanwhile they're all moving towards us in the struggle. the suspect is throwing punches when he can, and the officers are being pushed while swinging their batons. i stand in the corner by the door (which is wide open). they go by me. i was somehow untouched; and they're now in the alley. the alley is about the length of a football field. this struggle goes on for about 2-3min. while fighting their way up the alley, they knock over my stacked milk crates, (about 50 of them) and crash into the dumpsters. they make it 3/4 of the way through the alley before the suspect is taken down by the legs from one of the officers. both officers were about medium height 5'9-5'11 and definitely under 200lbs. as soon as he's down and cuffed the older officer kicks him and screams ""you mother f\*\*\*er!"" immediately after that 10+ officers show up the scene. it was chaotic. their patrol cars blocking the busy street, and bystanders wanting to know what happened. a few officers came down to us and asked for paper towels, because someone was bleeding. i handed it to them and just watched from the door. the officer who kicked the suspect was now in a sling; they took him away and things died down. we started to unload the truck about an hour later.

the next day two detectives came in to the store, wanting to see our security footage. my manager showed them and made them a copy. (can you believe while making them a copy; my manager spotted another shoplifter on camera. the detectives acted on it quickly. that's a much shorter story for another time.)  i was interviewed after that, and basically told them what i saw. no reason to lie because it's all on camera. a few weeks later my manager told me the police department wants to sue the store. i was shocked and wanted to know why. he said safety issues escalated the situation in the alley; i can't recall it exactly. but i do remember him saying that we can be in trouble for this because the backdoor to the store was opened. a summons was issued and i was asked to be a witness. i said sure.

&amp;#x200b;

a few months later i'm at my other job. i was a part-time student with two part time jobs. it was lot to juggle. i worked overnight by myself. my manager comes in the store and says jokingly ""what the hell did you do?"" i was confused and then he says ""they're feds outside!"" i look outside, and my eyes widened. i see people in fbi jackets walking around the empty parking lot. i quickly grabbed my phone to see that i missed the court date by a day. i was overworked tired and stressed. i completely forgot about the summons. i don't know much about the law thought i was about to be arrested for missing that date. the feds left the parking lot before my shift ended. i called my pharmacy store manager the same day and he told me it was postponed and he forgot to tell me. i ended up quitting the job a few months later, and never found out what happened. i'm assuming they settled.

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr : i witnessed a police officer getting injured while trying to stop a shoplifter. the store was being sued and i was asked to be a witness. i forgot about the court date and thought the fbi was ready to arrest me for it.

294,woman tries to use dead husband’s card number to buy expensive clothes,"hi! i work at an upscale women’s clothing store in a rich area. most of our costumer base is older women and while i wasn’t there for this i did hear the fallout.


most of our items are very expensive, i work in the back recording orders and haven’t seen anything below 90$, sometimes clothes are well over 1000$.


i’m glad i work there because out in front its a madhouse. a lot of pay for people who sell is based off of how much sales they do and people will frequently take shady costumers for a sale. most of the sales people were older women that frequently acted like children in order to get sales.


one day a woman came in (i’ll call her w) and from what i had heard, she was nice enough to the salespeople. she browsed around and eventually picked up 2,000$ + worth of merchandise. one of the sales people (i’ll call t) was eager to ring her up to get that sweet commission money. but there was only one problem.


w didn’t have any cash or a credit card.

w told t that her husband had died very recently and that w had memorized her husbands card number in her head and thats how she was going to buy it. t was eager to go ahead with the transaction.


something i should note about t is that her husband died very recently at the time of this tale, so its likely that t empathized with w and thats why she believed her.


w enters the card number wrong two times which our assistant manager notices. our assistant manager (c) isn’t an official assistant manager, more of a secetary that is the only reason why this place hasnt gone under. she isn’t bound by sales commissions and therefore has a moral compass about these things.


c asks whats going on and w explains to her. c doesn’t believe w, especially since w has gotten her husband’s card number wrong twice. c explains to w that she can’t complete this transaction and is welcome to come back with the card to complete it.


w says “okay” and walks out.


t was annoyed at c for not allowing her to complete the sale but after t cooled off she understood why c did that.


w never came back.


c theorizes that the story w gave wasn’t real and that she was trying to pull a fast one, especially since w never came back. i theorize that the husband was alive and certainly didnt know about this transaction.


whatever was the actually the deal with w, we will never know


edit: i talked to c about it again and c told me that w said that the clothes were for her husbands funeral. c had doubts

edit part 2: ok so!!! i was listening to oz media (something ironically i listen to at work) and i was astonished to hear my story tonight. if you are reading this oz, you just made my day.",luvdisclover,tfr
295,what do you mean you can't guarantee your repair against my own abuse of my instrument!?,"tl;dr at the end - i am the assistant manager of a local music store, where one of our more popular services is guitar setups - a routine maintenance we recommend twice a year which involves our tech adjusting the neck, intonation, action, etc. guitars are made of wood, and are therefore susceptible to weather and humidity changes, so people usually bring their guitars in for the tech to service as the weather is turning from summer to winter or vice versa and this weather change is causing the neck to be less than straight, usually resulting in fret buzz. an older gentleman came into the store looking to pick up his setup. i bring it out, look up his account, so far everything is routine, until...

(c = customer, m= me)

c: you know, i really can't believe this. i've only had this guitar a year and already it needs a repair. this is ridiculous.

m: well, yes, usually we actually recommend setups twice a year actually, with the weather changes. it's kind of like an oil change in your car.

c: no, it's bad business. i bought this guitar from you guys last year, and there's buzzing all over it! you guys sold me a defective guitar and now you're saying i need to pay to get it fixed.

m: (at this point realizing he is stubborn and i'm going to have trouble getting through to him) humidity and temperature changes affect wood, which is what this guitar is made of. every guitar in this store needs a setup at some point, and the high-end acoustic room is kept at 50% humidity at all times to try to combat that. it's every guitar, i promise you.

c: in all my 75 years, i have never once needed a setup on a guitar, and i know how to treat my guitars! you need to keep them away from moisture - i keep mine in a de-humidified room!

m: (trying to quickly unpack everything wrong with what was just said) alright, so i don't mean to insult your intelligence, but please do not keep your guitars in a de-humidified room, they'll dry out and crack and then you'll have bigger problems involving a luthier. also, i guess you're just really lucky with not needing setups, because we do them daily here as basic maintenance both for our own guitars and for customers. again, it's like never getting your car's oil changed.

c: if i'm paying to get this fixed, i at least expect it to hold. how long can you guarantee this setup for? what if it's buzzing again in two weeks?

m: sir, honestly, if you keep it dehumidified, it will be buzzing again in two weeks.

c: so you can't guarantee this setup? you should at least guarantee repairs for a year!

m: we can guarantee it insofar as you take care of the guitar on your end. we can't promise something like that knowing that you could be storing your guitar incorrectly.

c: if you can't guarantee your repairs, you lost a good customer! i've purchased guitars here for 15 years (i've never seen this guy in the 3 years i've worked there...) and now i'm never coming back. this is bad business!

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr guy gets basic guitar maintenance done, pitches a fit because he doesn't like that guitars require maintenance, it turns out he's storing all of his guitars in the absolute worst conditions for the instrument, pitches another fit because i can't guarantee the repair for a full year knowing he's not taking care of his stuff, we lose a ""good customer"".",Aerythea,tfr
296,"""you have ice right?"" stories of my seasonal cashier jobs - part 2 -"," okay, english isn't my native language so apologies in advance. i have lots of these stories so i'm going to divide every each of them. 

here's [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromretail/comments/ayo9go/why_do_you_have_to_eat_stories_of_my_seasonal/)

this happened two years ago. i worked as a store attendant in this store not as a cashier. i don't know if it's happening in other countries, but in turkey twice a year (every six months) you have to count all the products in the store and list them all to see if there is missing or more.

a team of store employees is created to do it. counting starts at 9 p.m (closing time) and ends in 9 a.m (opening time). 12 hours, all night. 

they don't normally do this with a seasonal employee. because seasonal ones probably going to do it wrong. but i took part in this count because of the short employee problem.

it's september, even though it's not too hot, doors are open but the store is closed. we keep vegetables like onions and potatoes out.  it's 1 a.m and a man approaches to the potatoes, takes a bag and starts filling. i see the guy with the tip of my eye and tell my coworker to look. 

coworker: \*yells\* sir! we're closed, we can't sell you those potatoes. 

customer: why'd you mean? \*confused\*

coworker: it's 1 a.m sir, we're counting. store is closed. please leave the potatoes and go.

customer: but... but i need these potatoes!

coworker: i'm sorry sir. please come back tomorrow morning.

luckily, the guy left without making a scene. but i still don't understand why he needed those potatoes in 1 a.m

it's 4 a.m not and a drunk dude enters the store. nobody pays attention at first because we're all like zombies. constantly counting the products on the shelves. he stands in the middle of the store and yells.

drunk dude: hey! you have ice right? where are they?

coworker: yeah, we have them but we're closed. 

dd: no, you're all here. that means the store is open. \*makes vomiting sounds\*

coworker: sir, we're counting. store is now closed. please come back in the morning.

dd: i was drinking raki, and i ran out of the ice. you have them right?

coworker: the cashier desks are closed i can't sell you anything. the machines won't work. it's 4 in the morning. 

dd: i just need ice. \*he pukes a little in his mouth.\*

me: oh god.. and we're gonna clean up the vomit at this hour. 

dd looks at me. 

dd: i'm not gonna throw up. i didn't even drink that much.

me: sir, if i light up matches anywhere near you, we'll all caught up on fire.

dd: wha... \*throws up\*

me: uh, perfect.

the employees picked him up and pulled him out of the store. ",omgplznope,tfr
297,back-to-back random acts of kindness,"hello all. i thought i'd share some good stories again before i get back into the bad customer stories. 

the needed background info. i am 22 and i currently work as a evening/night supervisor at a gas station that is linked a to larger retailer that is across the parking lot. 

now the way our checkout counter is set up we have the chewing tobacco and cigarette behind the registers so only the staff can get them. this is pretty common for most places i've been. my boss likes to use the top of the chewing tobacco rack for storing our drive-off log, and various papers. sometimes my boss will leave a paper showing a photo of a shoplifter, short change artist, etc. warning us of any potential criminal activity that we may encounter. sometimes there will be announcements for the employees there as well so i got into the habit of checking it whenever i arrived to work so as to keep up to date.
 
one evening i arrive at work and i check the rack for any announcements or notices only to find a gift card lying there. i saw there was a note written along the paper backing which read ""to the officer who receives this please know that we are praying for you and support you with all our heart"" i look at my boss who was about to leave and i ask him about the card. he replies that some older couple came in and bought it and told us to give it to a police officer when one comes in. as we get officers in the store all the time (we had 3 different patrol cars pull into our lot for snacks and drinks at the same time without meaning to once) i figure i would give it to the next officer to come in the door. 

now i know some of you may not hold the same view on officers as my company and i do but i have a lot of respect for officers who risk their lives for us everyday and i love to help them whenever possible. i know there are bad cops out there but all of the officers i have served at the store are all very friendly and great guys and gals and i trust them a lot. i know they go through a lot even in my quieter-than-normal city as my station happens to be just down the street from the most dangerous intersections in my state and as such accidents are sadly quite common.

ok back to the story.

now about 15 minutes later an officer comes in and he grabs some snacks and drinks and heads over to my register. i quickly ring up his order and i am able to give that officer the gift card. it was the only time i've seen an officer cry before and i know it made his day even more than it made my night. 

the next day i worked a late morning to late afternoon shift and i was doing the usual routine when a younger girl, probably a high schooler, comes in to pay for her fuel. i ring her up and she tries her credit card, once, twice, and three times but it doesn't work. she gets a little annoyed and asks if she can call her bank to figure out what is going on. i say ""sure thing, i completely understand. it's happened to me before too."" so i pause the transaction and move to take care of another customer while the girl is on the phone. 

as i ring up the older woman she asks what was going on with the younger girl. i tell her that her card was having issues and she was calling her bank. the older woman asks if i can add the girls fuel to her transaction. i ask if the woman is sure and when she says ""yes"" i add the girls fuel to the transaction and the woman pays for everything, asks me not to tell the girl, and leaves. 

just as the woman is getting into her van the girl hangs up and says she is ready to pay now. i tell her it's been taken care of and she looks at me in shock. she asks if it was the older woman who paid for her gas. i say that i cannot tell her but she runs out the door to try and thank the woman. i watch the two of them talking through the window then i look back at my boss who is grinning from ear to ear, he says "" i love it when that happens!"" we have a good laugh about it and the days goes well for everyone involved.

in my work i've seen that for every 2 to 4 horrid customers i get a great one like this. i was very happy to have two great customer interactions 2 days in a row. 

i do have a few more good interactions i could share but i do have a lot of bad ones as well. which would you prefer to read next? ",Goldstartankexpert,tfr
298,the law changed!!!! i got a text!!!!! but i can't find any evidence of it and deleted my text.,"i'm a manager at an electronics retailer. 

yesterday, i got called to the front check out to handle an angry customer.

she was buying a prepaid verizon card, but insisted that the law changed recently and she shouldn't be charged the mts local surcharge. only sales tax. i explain to her that that's not an item that gets a sales tax on it, first off, and that the surcharge is not something i get to adjust, anyways. it's a law. 

she goes on a tirade (saying she got a text, and deleted it, as mentioned in the title) and insists that i call verizon. my phones don't dial out, and she says she will call them and make me talk to them. the guy on the line doesn't know what she's talking about, and she rips him a new one before hanging up on him. 

meanwhile, i find what she's talking about:

""effect of court decision on sellers of prepaid mts (other than prepaid mts providers or suppliers per section 41007): effective immediately, sellers are no longer required to collect the statewide prepaid mts surcharge rate of 6.30 percent on sales of prepaid mts. however, the local charges are imposed upon prepaid mts under a separate act, the local prepaid mts collection act, which is still in effect. therefore, sellers of prepaid mts are required to continue to collect only the local charges, when applicable, on their sales of prepaid mts.""

the part she was missing was the mts local surcharge still exists. that's all she was being charged. 

""no no that's not it! it's only supposed to be sales tax!! i'll buy it but i'm keeping this receipt and when i find evidence that you're charging me when you shouldn't, i'll be back!"" 

it was a slow day, and i'm glad for the distraction, tbh haha",TinHawk,tfr
299,two tales from a convenience store worker,"i work at a small scale convenience store in southern nj. it has around 30 stores in the southern nj area. this company has been around for years, i think the family it's named after started their business as a milk delivery service then moved into the deli store business. during training, we are told that the original owner taught another famous store creator how to run a convenience store/ deli business and now that company is much larger.


most of the stores in the company are fairly small. but, the store i work at is the newest, biggest, and cleanest (thanks to me and my coworkers.) this store is dedicated to the original ceo. so it’s held to tougher standards than the rest.


this store is the largest, and is located on a busy intersection near a highway on-ramp and off-ramp. so we get more business than any other store. this means we get way more crazy people than other stores

story one: cigarette bitch


to start this story i want to give context.


me is me, s is my new coworker, cb is cigarette bitch


s is new, he was less than a week in at the time. he is also from africa, born in philly, and raised in an african country, so he knows english well enough but has an accent and doesn’t understand much about american culture. he’s nice as hell, and one of the best new workers i’ve ever worked with.


it was around 8:30 pm during a closing shift. my other coworker was in the walk-in filling the sodas, milk and other drinks. i’m in the deli making a sandwich and s is at the register ringing people up.


an older woman with a fur coat and straggly hair walk in. she immediately walks up to the register. i can't hear much from the deli due to all the buzzing that the refrigerators make (bain, deli meat case, etc).


i'm about halfway done the sandwich when i hear the cb scream at s that it's unacceptable and she wants to speak to a manager. (this isn't word-for-word, but its what happened)


i stop making the sandwich, turn around and tell the guest, who currently has his head turned toward the lady and is shaking his head.


me: sorry sir, i'll be just a moment


i walk over towards the register


me: is everything okay s?


s: yes, i think so, but we're ou--


cb: you're out of my cigarettes! i want to speak to the manager. it's not acceptable that you're out of my cigarettes!


me: well, ma'am i am not a manager, (there is never one on duty this late at night.) but if we are out of the cigarettes you want, then there is nothing we can do at the moment.


cb: why! dont you ever get new shipments!?


me: (confused as to what confused her about this) i'm not sure when we get new shipments of cigarettes in but if we run out during the day there is nothing we can do till we get a new shipment. again, i'm sorry.


cb: this is unacceptable! why are you out of my cigarettes!


me: ma'am there is nothing we can do. i'm sorry.


cb (squints eyes, and glares at me): if you were in my class at upenn, you. would. fail!!


at this point, i'm done. i was tired of this bitch and didn't want to deal with her anymore.


me: *turning around* whatever lady, i don't give two {non-customer friendly word} about your {another non-customer friendly word} upenn class. i don't need whatever worthless class you teach for my degree.


me: sorry, s. just finish ringing her up and be done with it.


she spent another 5 minutes huffing and puffing about it before paying and leaving. (with 5 packs of cigarettes) i never understand. when it comes to older people or smokers they're either really, really nice. or the nastiest, most rude people ever. 


the best part is, we keep our back stock of cigs under the register on the shelf. but s didn't know that since he was only around a week into working there when this happened. i didn't bother to check if we had it because she was so rude to not only me but my coworker. this happened around 3 weeks ago. i haven't got in trouble yet, but my manager likes to save stuff like that for meetings.


______________________________________________________________________________________________________
story two: flash lightman


this one happened significantly longer ago. in summer 2018.


i don't remember what time it was but it was pretty late because we were dead and it was dark outside.


an older man walks in and immediately comes up to the register. everyone else on shift is preparing to close so i go over. he's been in here before and is really friendly.


me: hi sir, what can i get you?


him: hello, {insert cigarette name}


i grab them and scan them.


me: that'll be $5.64 (something around that price)


him: uh, *pulls out flashlight tool kit with fold away screwdrivers* can i trade you this for the cigarettes?


me: uhhhhh, i don't think so.


him: aww man. the irs froze my bank account and stole all my money i can't buy anything!!


me - confused as hell: i'm sorry sir. let me see what i can do.


i walk over and ask my coworkers if they have any cash. none do, and all of us are under 21 so we couldn't buy him any with a debit card since nj recently raised the age.


me: sir, are you sure you don't have any money?


him: i have this 5 i was saving?


me: okay sir, that's fine. i'm sure i can find some change somewhere to make up the difference.


i hand him his cigarettes and let him keep his rad flashlight screwdriver kit.


turns out he came back in the next night with no cash and a metal toolbox. and offered to trade another coworker it for a pack of cigarettes. this guy still comes in very often. he is really nice whenever he does and always pays with money. it seemed like he was just having a bad couple of nights or something.",KevinD2000,tfr
300,"remember, you're here for the rest of your life!","tl:dr - i have had my five regulars that are god awful all seem to coordinate their schedules and showed up at once to make my life a living hell.

so i've been in retail for almost five years now in a big box store. i had started as a part time cashier, just because i thought the job would only last me a few months. that was a joke. i ended up becoming full time after six months, and then after another six months got promoted from a furniture associate to a technology associate at a store that was touted to be ""the new way retail works"". really the only difference was that the store was smaller, meaning we had to order more stock online because we just didn't have physical room for the inventory, and we had carpet all through the store. soon after that promotion, i was promoted to a management position about a year after working as a tech, and have been a manager for little over six months now.

it's important to note that my previous store is a good forty-five minutes to an hour away from my current store. we're in the same district, but we are probably the two furthest stores from one another in this district.

&amp;#x200b;

that being said, when i moved to my new store i had **5 very particular customers** that followed me to the new store, simply because i was ""the only competent associate"". really, i was just very good at smiling through their bullshit while mentally going through the list of things i would rather be doing than listening to them (pins in my eyes, a root canal, being waterboarded). thankfully, most of the time they don't ever coincide with their visits, but today the stars and planets seemed to align into the universe giving me a middle finger.

&amp;#x200b;

names have been changed so that i or they don't get identified.

&amp;#x200b;

the day started with **kim the con**. now kim met me when she was going through a very rough time in her life. i won't go into details, but in the end i ended up selling her a new computer and helping her set it up so that she ""could write her screenplay"". kim has come to me no less than twice a month in the last two years to talk with me about buying a new this or a new that, always when she's skint broke and unable to pay full cost, hoping that i'll give her a discount. when i got promoted she essentially had cartoon dollar signs in her eyes and believed that this meant i would give my ""dear friend kim"" some awesome discounts. not so. she came in with a sob story about how her computer is broken, her daughter is getting on it without her permission, and she needs me to sell her a new one, of course for a really massive discount. i tell her the sales, show her the computers, and the corresponding price tags, and she decides she wants the one computer that i didn't show her because honestly, the one i had sold her two years ago is a better pc than the one she picked out. i told her this, and she was frustrated, but she seemed to accept that i was trying to get her something at least better than her old pc.

&amp;#x200b;

cue **harriet the harpy** coming in. now harriet only comes to our store for the designated printing department. every single time she comes in there is something wrong with her order and every single time she demands a discount for all the ""time wasted"" on her order. well, when i became manager i started to really hammer in on the printing team that they need to make notes. i was sick of having to go into that department to fix a problem, but there were no notes and all i had to go on was ""he said she said"". the new tactic was to make the notes on the designated project sheet, and then have the customer initial by every single thing on the project (color copies vs black and white, if they want staples or binding, what kind of paper they want, etc. etc. etc.). now harriet is at the copy center, halfway across the store, and she starts *screaming*, ""where is snugglefrump? i need to speak with her."" bear in mind that at this moment i'm with kim the kon.

i excuse myself from kim, call another associate over to ""help her make a decision"", and then go up to the printing department to see what's wrong. i greet harriet in the way that only retail workers and prostitutes are required to greet their customers, and say with a sickeningly sweet smile, ""let's see what's going on here."" i open up the project folder and find, in harriet's familiar, awful cursive scrawl, the notes she had made. while i'm reading the notes, harriet is screaming about how my associates are idiots and ""snugglefrump is the only *actual* literate here!"" i finish reading the project and look at the completed project and can't tell what's wrong with it. it is *perfect,*  done exactly as per customer specifications, everything has been initialed and checked over. so i finally ask harriet what, pray tell, is wrong.

""well, the covers aren't blue! *obviously*!""

""harriet, you made specific notations for red covers, and i have here that you called on x day, and also on y day, to confirm that the covers are meant to be red. i can fix this for you, but we will have to charge you for the new covers, as this is not a problem on our end.""

you would have thought i had pissed in her cheerios right there in front of her. harriet begins to demand to speak to my manager. i call him over, and he looks at her like she's crazy and tells her the same thing i told her. at this point i'm getting calls from the associate that i had asked to help kim the kon, and apparently kim is now throwing her own tantrum (it's worth noting that i am hard of hearing in one ear, and my good ear is the one that i keep my radio in, so everything to me is a bit difficult to follow along with unless i take my radio out).

&amp;#x200b;

i leave harriet in the safe hands of the other manager and leave to talk to kim. kim is *bawling* over at the computers about how she can't afford the price of a new pc and that she needs snugglefrump there to help her (translation: to be her fairy godmother and gift her a nice shiny new computer for a fraction of the cost). i tell kim that i cannot and will not give her a discount, but that we can certainly work on cleaning up any viruses from her other pc to try and give it a new lease on life. it would still be at least $200 for us to do that, but that's not as bad as a $600 new pc. she agrees to the $200 and says she'll pay on pickup.

""no, kim. you'll pay now.""

""but i can't pay now.""

""well, if you can't pay now then you'll have to take your pc with you.""

""can't i just leave it here?"" there was *one* incident where kim had left her pc here and one of the tech associates, despite me telling him not to work on it because no payment had been taken, had essentially done $100 worth of work on it and kim had not had to pay for any of it because again, it was the time of the ""he said she said"" school of note taking.

""i don't physically have the room to store your pc, it's a 24 inch all in one and i have limited counter space.""

""okay, i'll take it out to my car.""

just as kim is leaving, i manage to catch a breath, go get an update on harriet (spoiler alert, she got her damn discount because of course she did), and then go to the back for a breather. i'm basically the designated closing manager for my store since i have it down to basically a science and i'm able to get us out at least close to on time at night, if not precisely on time. the problem with this is that the morning managers always leave at 2pm, about an hour after i get on shift, and then the mid shift managers will generally leave anywhere from 3pm to 4pm. if we have a rush then there's just no way that i will manage to get any form of a lunch or a break before they leave. that being said, my paycheques are usually at least $50 heavier if not more just because i am the only manager to work through the week that does not get a single break in my 9-10 hour shift and lunches are unpaid time. if i'm not taking that unpaid time then i'm getting paid for it. this also means that i will generally be on call during any breathers i take, which means i will only get about 5 minutes or so to stuff my face, take a drink of water, piss, or anything else that i might need to do between insanities.

&amp;#x200b;

enter **jobless joe**, stage left. jobless joe is retired, and he makes a big deal about the fact that he is retired and that he has been going insane with it. this, apparently, means that he has the time and the license to drive *me* insane too. he comes in and demands to talk to me (surprise surprise). i finish chugging a bottle of water, look longingly at the lunch i had managed to pack earlier (fool that i am thinking i might get a real lunch today), and then go onto the floor. i meet joe about halfway across the store and he doesn't beat around the bush.

""i applied for a job at your store, why haven't you hired me?""

""well, i am not the manager in charge of hiring, that would be (assistant manager) and (general manager). if you'd like to leave your phone number i can have them call you.""

""why haven't they hired me yet, i applied a month ago!""

""i'm not sure why, joe, but it might be because hr has not sent them your application.""

""what?""

""applications go through a screening process with hr. you have to have a certain ""score"" for our store to even be sent your application and resume in the first place. you can call 1-800(redacted) if you want to speak with hr about your application.""

""why can't *you* just hire me! you know i'm a good person!""

may it please the court: joe has conned us out of hundreds of dollars because of bogus ""discounts"" and talking around my newer employees who don't know that kindly old grandpa types can scam just as bad as anyone else.

""sorry, joe, i don't make the rules, i only enforce them.""

""well, can't you bend the rules for me?""

""sorry, joe, no can do.""

joe leaves in a huff, glaring and snarling when one of the more unwitting associates tells him, ""have a nice day!""

i get about another five minutes, laboriously warming up my food in the crappy breakroom microwave, willing it to heat at least to lukewarm so that i don't gag on it when i eat it, when i get another call over to the technology department this time.

**paranoid pete** is here. joy of joys. now pete is.... an interesting case. i'm honestly not sure about how much of what he says is true, and tend to take what he says with a grain of salt. now pete is *convinced* that his neighbours are hacking him. he won't tell me what for (as his data and his banking info seems to be fine) and he constantly says that they are hacking and cyber bullying him by shutting off his wifi, sending him viruses, taking over his computer with ransomware and moving his mouse around on his screen. we sold him a *very* expensive internet security device and several different versions of protection, as well as the advice that if they really are hacking his computer, that he should report it to the police so that he could have the law on his side. so far, i have not heard from pete or his wife, equally paranoid patricia, that they have made a report to the authorities.

pete has been hacked again and he's angrily telling me that the security system that we sold him hasn't worked. so i ask him where he installed it, if he installed it correctly, how often he believes the hackers have been accessing his pc, what he thinks they've been trying to access.... and i ask him to pull up the app i had helped him install on his phone to check the status of the security system.

"".... pete.""""yeah?""""has the app always shown this?""""yes! ever since i installed the security system!""""pete, you never turned the device *on*.""

pete immediately stares at me and then sputters and gets angry. i take the phone for a brief moment, turn on the device via the app, take a screenshot of the settings, and show him what the settings should always look like.

""check on this when you need to see what the status of your system is, and this should show you all of these lit up in green."" i send pete on his way and get back to my meal.

things are quiet and reasonable for a while, and the last hour of us being open rolls around. i go to the back, gather up all of my supplies for counting down the till, and head to the front end to close down registers. now our printing department has a register there as well, and during the last half hour of being open i can easily take any lingering customers at the one remaining register over at printing. i send my cashier over there, and proceed to quickly pull the two front tills before i go over to cover my cashier.

&amp;#x200b;

as i was making my way over to the final register, with my cart full of money, i am nearly stopped by **shady sam**.

shady sam is.... as his name suggests.... pretty shady. i've never had him really *buy* anything here per se, but i've had him snooping around the store regularly. he always flirts with my (very young) cashiers and he always demands to know the costs of various items and claims everything is too expensive and that he could buy it cheaper on amazon.

i, as previously noted, have a cart full of money and i just walk past shady sam and go to the printing department. i park my cart at the very back of the department behind a maze of machines, and tell the other associates to not leave the department. i go over to shady sam and he is looking twitchier than usual. i ask him if he needs help and he asks me if i can sell him some canned air.

.... alright. not the strangest thing anyone has bought today (that award was given to the customer that had us order a typewriter for him online). i take him over to our canned air, and ask him what he would like to get. he grabs three threepacks (nine cans total) and we go to the printing department to check him out. i check him out, bag his items, and watch him leave, before i start to count down the final register. just as i've finished counting the last register, the associate that had gone outside to gather carts calls me on the radio.

""dude, shady sam is having a seizure in his car, call 911.""

that's right. shady sam, at 9pm at night, huffed canned air in his car and proceeded to give himself a seizure from it. we call 911, get an ambulance, and the police out there. the police officer shattered the guy's window to get into the car, and shady sam looked at the cops, had a moment of clarity from his aerosolized air induced high, and proceeded to grab another can of air, and huff it right there in front of the cops. i give the cops the receipt of shady sam's purchase, and video footage of him coming and buying the air, and then tell them if they need any more info to call the store. they leave, i go inside, finish closing, and pray that the store burns down in the night.

301,went so well till the end.,"so this happened a couple of weeks ago and still really ticks me off.

im a cashier and had been almost done with my whole shift. roughly 7 hours and i’m tired, i wanna go home, play some games, then pass out. had about 15 minutes till i was out of there when a lady and her husband came through with 2 large filled to the top carts. i look at the clock and know this is gonna take more than 10 minutes.
for my store we had our last 10 minutes for clean up, knowing it would take me well into my cleaning time, i switch off the light to my register. i start the transaction acting as happy as i normally act for customers. about half way through my main boss tells me to turn my light back on and a few other things that i couldn’t hear. i sigh and do as i’m told but turn away customers when they tried to get in because i was assuming that someone wasn’t going to take over for me. some small time passes and i am notified that someone will be taking over and i nod as i let people to get in line.

just as i’m finishing the transaction the lady hands me more than a hand full of coupons. (lovely....) with a smile i start to scan them and as i get to the last one.....it doesn’t work. not all that frantic i tell her that it’s not taking it. she starts to say that she knows she bought it and i scan it once more. i tell her that the computer says the product isn’t within the transaction.
this is when things start to fall apart. she starts yell at me on how she knows she got the right kind and everything that the coupon says needed for use.

trying to stay calm i ask for the product as i try to look through the transaction on screen to find said product. (i think it was some sausages? that were probably 2 something max. they were our brand as well so not that expensive what so ever.)
my manager comes over to see what was going on and she tells me to scan the coupon once more. i do some and show her the screen, she’s slightly puzzled, clearly trying to think of what another reason may be. as she’s doing so the lady then goes off on my manager about me.
how i just want to get off of work, that i’ve been pushing customers away, that i was being rude.
i try to tell her that, that wasn’t the reason. though i’ll admit i was a little eager to go home, but i would have stayed 20 minutes to just figure out the problem. not to mention she was there when the whole time on why i was pushing customers away. i didn’t at first think i was going to have someone come and take over the register.

the only time i could think of when i would of been rude is when her and her husband started to talk so my courtesy clerk and i decided to pick up the conversation that we left from when she came up. she did give me an odd look that i saw from my peripheral vision, like my coworker and i were just supposed to be there quiet and do our job. like we were fine talking and doing our job at the same time.
so that i can end the story, what ended up happening is that she got the wrong size.
we have her the coupon regardless because it was the smaller size. (manager said to do so, i wouldn’t have tbh) as i give her, her receipt she very loudly stated that she hopes theres a survey on there. that it was the worst transaction she’s ever been through.

like, lady, you and i were laughing a couple of times and talking about her dogs through a large portion of it!!! how was that bad. it only got bad when she lost her sh*t!!
apparently she does this a lot from what the person who took over for me said.

302,“thanks for nothing”,"i work as stock and cashier at a small drug store close to where i live, and this happened a few months ago. we got hit by a pretty bad snowstorm a day before this happened and because of that, the roads were icy and dangerous to drive on. i was working register in the morning and we didn’t get the newspapers as we normally did because of the roads. around 2 in the afternoon, an older gentleman walks up to the register and just stares over at where the newspapers usually are for a few seconds and looks up at me. 

him: “where are the papers?”

me: “they didn’t come in because of the roads, they must’ve been delayed and won’t be coming in.”

he just said “oh,” looked around for like 5 seconds and said to me, “thanks for nothing.” i went completely red in the face and had a total loss for words, then he left. i just said, under my breath, “you’re welcome.”

303,"""it's a lot. good luck with that.""","so, this is my first reddit post ever.  i'm sorry if the formatting is poor.  i'm not sure if i'm doing this right.

quick backstory: i work at a low-price clothing store (though we do sell other goods like home decor, kitchen wares, toys, and luggage).  i work as the fitting room attendant, and like most stores, the fitting rooms are located in the back.  this happened on a closing shift right after i just got back to fitting rooms after my break.

&amp;#x200b;

i was switching positions with my co-worker who watched fitting rooms while i was on break.  my co-worker was letting me know how many people were in fitting room, what was a hold, so on and so forth when a family walks up.  the mother was pushing a cart full of home decorations with a toddler in the seat.  there were two older girls, one of which looked a little pale and embarrassed.

&amp;#x200b;

the father piped up and said, ""my daughter threw up on the floor.""

now, in my near year of working retail, i had expected this to happen sooner or later.  pretty standard, your average every day retail story.  everyone has one of these.  however, the father's attitude was what needs to be noted.

&amp;#x200b;

my coworker was the first to speak, ""oh, i'm sorry she isn't feeling well.  where exactly did she throw up?""

&amp;#x200b;

the mother answered by pointing to the front of the store, ""over there somewhere.""

my coworker and i look at each other a little confused, and we notice that the family started to carry on with their shopping.  i was reporting the throw up to my shift lead while my coworker tried to get more details on where it was.  the father was getting fed up with us while his daughter (who just threw up) was getting paler by the second.  she clearly wasn't well, but that didn't stop the family from shopping some more.

&amp;#x200b;

while i was reporting the throw up, i heard the father tell my coworker, ""she threw up by luggage.""

side note, our luggage displays are at the **very front** of the store.  in fact, our luggage display is right next to the registers.  registers always have at least one person up front to help with purchases, as well as our security guard.  why this family came to the fitting rooms to tell someone their kid threw up is beyond me.

&amp;#x200b;

the father walks away with his poor daughter (who looked like she was about to pass out) and calls to us in a mocking tone, ""it's a lot!  good luck with that!""

&amp;#x200b;

my shift lead and i cleaned up the throw up.  it was a lot, but it wasn't bad.  that family ended up dragging their sick daughter around the store for another hour before heading home, but not without giving my coworker more attitude and being rude while they tried on clothes.

&amp;#x200b;

this isn't a unique story, but it definitely gets my blood boiling.  i hope i never see these people again.

rol= rude old lady

&amp;#x200b;

this happened about a year ago, but i remember it fairly clearly.

&amp;#x200b;

i was called on my walkie-talkie to help a customer load their vehicle; she had a flatbed (l-cart) of about...13 buckets of cat litter (not kidding). i came into the vestibule and greeted the rol as i usually do (hello and how are you...etc) and so far there's nothing going wrong here as we get to her car (it's a normal sedan car) that's in a handicap space, so of course she did need help.

&amp;#x200b;

context for what's about to happen: i was dealing with some back issues (tightness) for about a week and a half, but it wasn't enough to keep me from work (i usually call out sick if either a: i can't move due to pain, b: sick as a dog, or c: weather) and also the buckets weighed about 40-45lbs...each! (also, i don't lift weights as the job is exercise enough as my main problem was endurance)

&amp;#x200b;

ok, the trunk opens and it's empty, good start i thought, so as i load the buckets in myself (rol can't lift them as she needed help to get them on the flatbed/l-cart, which was understandable), i then say ""this might not fit all of them"", that's when things go south...fast. rol then starts yelling as i continue to load the buckets (with slight pain in my back) and then yells ""you're doing it wrong!"", i take a quick look at rol and then continue to load the buckets, rol then yells at her friends who are standing at the entrance the same thing and then as i'm finishing (just barely fit all of them), rol then says this ""for a man, you're pretty weak"" and in my mind i thought ""did rol just say that?"" (i didn't say this out loud) and it made me pause for a second or two, i then finished up...took the flatbed/l-cart and didn't even say ""have a good day"" because of the shock, i didn't even say anything to rol's friends, i just walked inside (called for my break on my walkie-talkie) and told one of my supervisors as i was passing by and she was shocked (this doesn't happen often to the cart guy...if at all where i work). honestly...i'm just shocked i didn't yell at rol when she said those things. thank goodness it was a slow tuesday.

305,the old man asked the clerk to write down a letter what he speaks,"it was around 4 am. in this time, almost no one visits a convenience store. i was watching a strange cat video.

as i write what he said and showed that to him, i could read his slightly disappointed face. actually i was disappointed to myself anyway.

&gt; me: i'll write it better again...


when i was rewriting the letter, he offered me a drink. i was refused it once, because writing is not so hard for me. but as he offered me again, i changed my mind and took the offer.

if i refuse his favor again, he would felt like he had a dept, and also, a free drink is free.


and as i finished the rewrite, he asked me fold the letter good looking figure. i knew what was his order, but i'm not talented to folding a paper as well. i was tried, but that figure wasn't i imagined... but he took it happily anyway. he thanked me repeatedly, and left the shop.

307,battery sparks are fun!,"so, i used to work at a retail store that mainly sold batteries and light bulbs (amazing i know). since we had to work with all sorts of batteries and bulbs, we needed to go through all of these training modules for how to properly handle every kind of battery/light bulb. this included car batteries and how to also install them (which for where we were was super illegal since we didn't have a permit that let us do so). anyway, we are constantly reminded on how to test the car batteries properly and check their current voltage, temperature, etc. you always want to put the clamps onto the corresponding terminals, i.e. positive to positive, negative to negative. this will be important a little later.

on this shift its myself and my coworker, lets call him marth. now marth is an older man who has worked with cars for a super long time before working here. he fixed them a lot so i always let him take lead on anything about cars when it was just the two of us. he never minded since it was a specialty of his. this shift was one of the closing ones, and after being there for longer than the pay was worth both of us were exhausted. it's winter and pitch black outside and we just want to go home. 

around 7:15pm (we closed at 8pm) a customer walks in with his car battery lower than it should be. not exactly dead but not winning any battery awards either.  we begin the usual line of questioning and testing. ""what is the battery being use for?"", ""have you been maintaining it properly?"" etc. the customer tells us that the battery has been crapping out on him and wants a new one. no problem. we take his old one to the back and fill out the proper paperwork for him. we pull the battery out and test our battery to make sure that its all good. 

the battery is a little low but the car should charge it up fine. now, the policy of the store is that we first try to sell the batteries that have been there the longest since they would be the ones likely to die sooner. we tried to keep all of our batteries properly maintained so this wasn't a really big issue, but it looked like we missed one. just so he can do good by both our boss and the customer, marth offered to charge it up with one of the jumppacks on the shelf. the customer was pretty relaxed and had no issue with it. now this whole time i've been just causally chatting with the customer and cleaning the store since we were about to close so i was pretty obvious to what marth was doing. if you don't know what a ""jumppack"" is, its basically a portable device that could jumpstart a battery, giving it a quick boost in charge and voltage.

he proceeds to grab one of the jumppacks and begins hooking it up to the battery. since he was their since opening (8am) and worked roughly 40+ hours a week, he was understandable tired. to this day i'm not sure what when through his mind when he put the clamps on the wrong terminals and flipped the jumppack's switch. almost immediately the battery began to smoke from its terminals as sparks were flying everywhere. all three of us were in a state of shock. marth was the first who snapped back and immediately ripped off the clamps. the terminals on the battery had melted bad. it looked like someone took a bite out of one of the terminals as the other had hot and bubbly metal replacing what once was the positive terminal. 

we were all silent and then began hysterically laughing about how we almost destroyed a battery. we went and gave the customer another battery, this one at the perfect voltage, and a discount for his troubles. he was more than happy to pay regular price after that show but marth insisted. i don't know how but the boss never gave marth a hard time about it, and eventually marth even bought the messed up battery for his own car. so i guess everything worked out in the end.

308,if it is so easy you do it.,"this is my first post in this subreddit.  i have read many stories and loved them so thought maybe i should contribute.  sorry for the long post but it is helps to show the situation the gentleman was in.  i have retired from retail now but have done retail for 30+ years so i have a lot of stories.

&amp;#x200b;

i managed a fairly good sized family owned outdoor power business.  we sold everything from small farm equipment down to the garden trowel.  it was an incredibly hot late june but grass was growing because it had been a wet season.  the brand we sold had recently introduced a 42"" zero turn mower with a steering wheel.  i placed this mower near the parts and service counters with a sign on it as we were running a special.  enter nice elderly gentleman eg and cheap wife cw while staff was busy with customers.  immediately evident was the man had been struggling as his face was red and covered in sweat.  i personally was bouncing between parts and service counters helping out as they were busy and sales wasn't.  when they entered i looked up and greeted them apologizing that we were all busy but we would be with them soon.  until then please help themselves to the seats, chilled water and snacks we had out.

&amp;#x200b;

i finished first with my customer and walked over to eg who now is circling the mower and shake his hand introducing myself.  he starts asking me about the mower so i start answering them.  after a few questions his wife comes over and starts in on us.  ""you don't need to sell him a new mower.  we have a push mower that he has been using for years and it is perfectly fine.  just get us a new blade and we can leave.""

&amp;#x200b;

he hands me a slip of paper with the model numbers from his mower and i go to look it up.  meanwhile the wife continues to scold him for trying to waste money on a mower and how the mower wouldn't work as their backyard has a gate.  after retrieving the blade approaching the counter his wife has now gone to the table putting snacks and water in her large purse.  the eg hands me the money for the blade and i make change.  as i hand him the change i pass him a pamphlet about the new rider and they leave.

&amp;#x200b;

over an hour later the eg calls asking for me.  i answer asking if there is a problem.  he had been struggling to take the bent blade off and now needs me to send someone to either fix it there or bring it back to our shop and change the blade for him.  i get his address realizing he is close to my bank so offer to just stop by and change the blade for him since i could probably do it in a minute or so since i needed to go by there anyway.  when i got there his wife was asking how much i was going to charge her for doing this and said it was fine as i was going just down the street.  she goes inside and he starts asking more questions.

&amp;#x200b;

a couple hours later he returns and i see him from my office desk so i meet him before he gets across the showroom.  concerned and asking if everything is alright he says everything is fine and thanks me for helping him out.  he asks me how would he get the mower into his back yard when it is fenced off and i inform him the with with the chute raised is only 45"" so if they had a 48"" gate it usually fits.  if not we do have another rider that is only 32"" wide but not zero turn.  he smiles saying his gate has 46"" of clearance and wondered if we could deliver by closing time.

&amp;#x200b;

after signing the paperwork, taking the payment and setting up a delivery within the hour i asked about this wife.  ""apparently she decided to go with the rider then.""  once again he grins saying ""oh hell no.  she said it was easy to use the push mower so i might as well keep doing that.  i told her if it is so easy then get out there and finish it.  otherwise i'm going to buy that rider.""

&amp;#x200b;

worried about drama i went with the deliveryman to ensure no problems.  his wife looked out the windows but never came outside.  when we left he was happily mowing the yard on his new rider.

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr  wants a rider mower but cheap wife says no.  husband tells her to mow and then gets his rider.

customer fills out our online form to order a cake for her 6 year old daughter. indicates that she wants to pick it up on sunday. no problem, i reply to her via the email she supplied, and told her we'd have it ready on sunday for her.

i come in to open up on wednesday, and there's an angry voicemail from the woman, complaining that she came to pick up her cake on monday afternoon, and she can't believe we're closed!

i call her up, and she absolutely chews me out. cl: daughter's birthday is ruined! we're the worst business she's ever dealt with, etc.  typical crazy parent reaction.

when she calms down enough to  take a breath, i ask her ""if you needed the cake on monday, why did you indicate that you'd pick it up on sunday?""

cl: no, i didn't! i know what day my daughter's birthday is! it's your fault for not telling me that you're closed on monday!

ok, so i've got the email showing exactly what she ordered, and my email reply, where i stated ""we'll have it ready for you on sunday""

me: did you get my email response?

cl: i don't read email!

me: well, we state on the form that we'll respond by email to confirm, and it says right here that you'll pick it up on sunday at 2pm.

cl: (changing her story now...) well, i said sunday, but just in case i decided to pick it up early. i really wanted to pick it up on monday. and you should have told me that you're closed on monday!

me: so, i was supposed to realize that even though you said you'd pick it up on sunday, you really meant to pick it up on monday, and i was to warn you about that?

cl: yes!

me: ok, have a nice day! click.

310,politeness has its own risks,"so i'm not a frequent user of reddit, but recently i've been absorbed in reddit commentary videos (shoutout to voiceyhere and fresh) and i decided that i would contribute my own story, so here goes i guess.

&amp;#x200b;

tl:dr at the end

&amp;#x200b;

backstory: i worked with a company who distributes private school uniforms to parents who aren't terrible, but aren't amazing either. my job was to stand out on the floor and help customers find what they needed to dress their precious angels. the two things i hated the most about this job were that the pay was the federal minimum wage of 7.25 despite the work being worth far more than that, and the fact that the boys who worked there were given positions which didn't have to deal with customers as often (ex. girl would get standing floor jobs and cash register positions and guys would get jobs like pressing designs onto shirts in the back).

&amp;#x200b;

now on to the real story.

&amp;#x200b;

this story takes place right at the end of one of my shifts in the summer of 2017. i was on closing duty that day which basically means i help get customers out as quickly as possible and i clean up the store floor a little bit. we also had two keyholders there and two other employees. the only people out on the store floor were myself and one of the key holders who we'll call davis. at this time, the store was closed. the lights were mostly off and the glass doors at the front were locked.

i was checking the aisles for misplaced clothing items that parents tended to leave around when i notice that davis is cracking open the front door to talk to a man and tell him that we're closed. davis eventually lets him in and tells me that he insisted he was just looking for one t-shirt. one t-shirt couldn't hurt, right?

this man then has the audacity to walk over to our shirts counter and order several shirts to be embroidered. instead of turning him down, the employee behind the counter gives him a 15 minute estimate and tells him that he can browse the store in the meantime. 

about 2 or 3 minutes later, i see that davis is opening the front door to a woman and two children (looked to be 8 and 12 years old) who bear a striking resemblance to the man. the woman is asking about her husband and it dawns on davis that this was all a scheme to get into the store after hours, but lets them in anyways because there's already an embroidery running for the husband anyways. davis asks me to help them with other items while the shirts are being stitched and i'm more than happy to move them along. 

i follow them to the pants aisle and i'm instantly relieved to see that the 12 y/o is capable of finding his own pants to try on. the 8 y/o on the other hand does not know what he's doing, which is completely understandable, so i offer to measure his waist to help size him. the kid is wearing khaki pants which you can barely see because of the extremely long white polo shirt he has on over it, and he's also fairly short, so i have to squat down to be able to wrap the measuring tape around his waist. 

all was going well until the mother decided to help me by lifting up the boy's over sized polo. upon lifting the shirt i could see a little potbelly, and as my eyes unfortunately traveled south, i noticed that this kid's fly was completely down, and that he was not wearing any sort of underwear. i was completely disgusted.

i quickly sputtered out a measurement and stumbled up backwards and walked away. i asked for davis to take over, which he agreed to understandingly, and i did not have to make any sort of contact with them for the rest of the night.

i admit i reacted a little dramatically, but at the same time what type of person decides it's okay to single-handedly keep a store open 15 minutes past clothing and lets their son dress so terribly. 

i did not get paid enough for that.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: man keeps store open 15 minutes past closing, brings in family and flashes me with his eight year old's bits.

by one of the tills is a walkie-talkie that security uses to warn all stores in the centre and on it we hear vague descriptions of a grey jacket woman and a man with a baseball cap (that was all we could make out their radios are trash.)

eventually between my lessons in till usage the guy teaching me reaches down and rings a bell for one long ring, as this happens he gestures over to a woman where another coworker follows her, calling out to her. she leaves only to be confronted by the centres security.

she had a lego set stuffed in her jacket. cops were called and i continued learning. when i left, the police and managers were in a back room with her. next shift is on saturday, maybe i’ll find out what happened to her.

tl;dr
my literal first shift at a toy shop and a woman is caught stealing lego and the cops were called.

what an exciting first day back in to retail, i missed this. (joking)

312,clueless about how credit/debit works.,"quite a few years ago, i worked at an electronics retailer that dealt in pre-owned merchandise. one day this couple comes in. they purchased a used xbox 360 and a couple of games, which at the time came out to about $300. the place i worked for didn't differentiate on the color of the systems as they were always in the same generic box, and they never specified a color of choice. they paid with credit/debit and left.

about 30 minutes later i get a call from the wife essentially saying i gave them a white system but they needed a black system since it was for their son and all his electronics are black. they wanted it to match. after a search, i found that we didn't have anything other than white 360s in stock. they asked if they could return it and go get a new one from another place. i agreed, they returned, and i credited the full amount back to their card.

and hour or so later i get a call, this time from the husband, and he is yelling. he's accusing me of pocketing his money since he checked his bank and the money isn't there. i tell him that, as everyone knows, credit/debit refunds usually take a day or two to clear. he begins yelling at me that i never told him that and now i ruined his son's birthday party, since they don't have the funds to buy him a 360. i apologized, even though it wasn't my fault and he hung up.

i come to find out that he called to the corporate office to complain. they patched him through to our district manager at the time who was one of the most spineless people i knew. i could write a novel about his antics. in an effort to placate the couple, he invited them to the other store he was working at that day and gave them a free black 360 and games. they then took it to a 3rd store, returned it all for cash, and never bought anything else.",DarthKallos,tfr
313,"lady ruins product, and pretends i'm her therapist","so, i currently work in a shoe store in my local mall. last week, i had a fairly crazy customer that i can't stop laughing about. it's not necessarily as wild as some of the other stories i've read in here, but still amusing enough that i thought i'd share.

a woman came into the store and asked if i had a particular shoe brand she could see and try on. no big deal, right? so i show her the selection we have and she chooses several shoes from that brand, plus another brand that she wants to try on. in our store, we keep all of the shoe boxes in the back, so i go back and get all that she requested in her size. 

this is where it started to get weird. she starts going on a rant about how she ""hates men, they're no good,"" and tells me how her on-again/off-again boyfriend ""likes me one day, hates me the next... is seeing another girl one day, wants me the next, and i just can't take it anymore!"" even though i want to be a therapist after i get my masters in a few years, i'm not this lady's therapist. i'm being paid to sell shoes, not listen to her drama.

either way, i'm being kind. i'm nodding at the appropriate places, adding minor commentary and so on. i look down and realize two of the shoes she tried on are now stained with some black streaks, because this woman isn't clean and she's trying the shoes on without socks. *great*. but i don't worry too much about it— i can fix it later. i work on commission, so i just really want to make this sale. 

it seemed like forever, but was probably only about ten minutes or so, that this lady ranted about her love life (or lack thereof), and tried on shoes. she ended up getting a pair and continues ranting as i'm checking her out. all of a sudden, she starts looking over her shoulder. after about the third time, she whispers, ""oh, i better shut up. *that's my husband.*""

i didn't know what else to do except tell her the total, take her money, and tell her to have a nice day. i'm just thankful she's the worst customer i've had to deal with thus far... but i've only had this job for a month, so knock on wood.",theapocalipsticks,tfr
314,about that ice fishing...,"i work in a shop in a touristic area in my town. very historical and popular summer and winter alike. lots of activities in town, festivals and concerts. i work there all year long, some funny things happen but this one... my brain just couldn't...

it was a somewhat busy day, not too intense but enough people to make it profitable. there i was, behind the counter, doing something i don't remember what... then this lady comes in with her kids, she looks around for a little time and buys a t-shirt. she comes to pay and starts asking about activities in the old town that she could do with the children. i'm used to that kind of question, i always have an activities program pamphlet nearby. so i tell her what is going on in town right now, give her a few ideas while she pays. then she ask me : ""what about ice fishing? i heard you could do that here! it sounds fun, i bet the kids would love it! where can we do that?""

for context, yes it is possible to do ice fishing in the old port in wintertime, february would be the best. but when this incident happened, believe it or not, we were in july...

i look at the lady, then her kids. they look at me and then their mom... pretty sure we all look equally confused.

me: sorry mam', what?

her: where do we go to do ice fishing?

me: hum... it's not gonna be possible...

her: for what reason? why can't we go ice fishing?

one kid: eh... mom? we're in summer...

her: (looks like her brain is processing the information) ... ooooooooh! sorry i forgot!

she laugh and she and her kids walk out... for a while i stood there not sure whether to laugh or just feel awkward xd",Nirliit,tfr
315,discount diva,"this one is one of my favorite retail stories.  years ago, i worked in a chain bookstore.  it was a great job and i loved it because i'm a total bookworm.  the job was not without some odd customers though.   our store had a hallmark section, for cards, ornaments and other hallmark brand items.  this was back in the day when people still kept photos in albums, that's important for this story.  


i normally worked on displays and special orders but one day i was manning the giant front desk covering lunch breaks for the cashiers.  here comes the discount diva.  an older lady dressed in very nice clothes, rings on her fingers, big flashy necklace, carefully styled hair.  honestly, her outfit probably cost more than i made in a month.  she brings a photo album up to the desk, what followed was utterly ridiculous.  she asks how much the album is, so i check the price and here we go...  (this was a long time ago and i've slept since then so i'm paraphrasing.)  


dd= discount diva,  am = awesome manager   


me - ""this album is $18 dollars, ma'am.""   

dd - ""what?  that's too much, it's *damaged*.  can't you give me a discount on it?""    she points to some sticker gunk on the front of the album where a special sale sticker had been previously.    
me - ""i'm sorry ma'am, this is a hallmark item.  i'm not authorized to discount the prices on hallmark items, it's a distributor rule.  besides, it's just some sticker gunk, it will come right off."" 

dd - ""well, don't you have *another* one?""

i check the inventory system and nope, this is the last one of this type in the store.  me - ""i'm sorry, it looks like this is the only one we have.""

dd -scoffs at me and starts frowning  ""well, i want to buy a nice album for my niece who's getting married.  this album would be *perfect* if it weren't damaged.  the *least* you could do is give me a discount on it.""  


me - ""ma'am, i'm sorry, i can't do that.  is there another one like this over there?""   because i can't see that side of the shelf from the big desk.  

dd - ""no!  this is the *only* one and i want a *discount* on it.  it's *damaged*.""  


at this point, i just slide the album closer to me on the counter and shake my head.  i give my best smile and put on my 'phone voice' which is the one i used when answering the phone, super smooth and perky!   


me - ""i'm very sorry, ma'am, but we have to turn damaged items over to the hallmark representative.  we are not allowed to discount them.  anyway, wouldn't your niece appreciate a different gift that *wasn't* damaged?""

(ok, so i was just asking for it at this point, but it had been a weird morning and i was hungry. )

dd - ""oh that is it!  i want to speak to your manager!  i'm going to tell him how rude you are!""

  
i sigh and pick up the intercom phone to page the manager on duty.  he was such a great guy!  one of the best managers i've ever worked with.   he was out on the floor helping stock shelves so he came really quickly.  

am - ""hello!  i'm the manager on duty right now, how can i help you ma'am?""    
dd - ""this girl is so rude!  she *refuses* to sell me that album.  i want to buy it, it's the last one on the shelf.""    


am looks at me.   me - ""she's insisting on a discount and claims it's damaged.""  

am - ""ma'am, this is a hallmark item.  we can't discount hallmark items.  their prices are set by that distributor.  all we can do is send it back if it's damaged.""  he is looking over the album now, looking for damage.

dd - ""i don't see why you can't do that.  i'll give you $12 for it.""   
am - ""ma'am, i don't even see what damage you're talking about.""   
dd - ""right there!  the glass on the picture frame on the front is all messed up...""  
am - ""ohh,..""  
dd - ""and this girl dared tell me it wasn't a good enough gift for my niece, she is so rude!""  


am and dd continue back and forth, but i wasn't paying attention to what they were saying.  you see, i had a cleaning cloth and some windex under the counter for cleaning the windows.  i discreetly scooted the album over by the register and started cleaning it.    back to the argument, which my awesome manager was handling as best he could but was getting no where!   


dd - ""so you mean to tell me that you won't sell it to me for less?""  


am - ""no ma'am, i can't do that.  i could call one of our other locations to see if they have one like it that isn't damaged if you want, but i am absolutely not authorized to discount that item.""  


dd - ""i am not about to drive all over to find another one, i want that one!""  


am - ""but ma'am, you claim it's damaged, why would you want a damaged item?""  


me - ""here you go.  it's perfect now.  no need for a discount.""  i smile and slide the album onto the counter between them.   shining and clean, not a speck of sticker gunk anywhere and just a slight hint of windex smell.    the discount diva's jaw drops!   she turns three shades of red in the face and starts blustering.    


dd - ""you lied to me!  you said there was only one left in the store, where did this one come from?""

me - ""it's the same one.  i told you the sticker gunk would come right off.""  i shrug.   my manager is now trying to cover his mouth and not laugh.  


dd - ""forget it!  i don't believe this!  i can't believe you treat customers this way!  i'll be calling your district manager!""  she fumes, snatches up her purse and storms out of the store.   my manager and i watch her stomp down the sidewalk from the big windows behind the desk.   he finally snickers and takes the album from me.  it was put back on the shelf and someone else bought it a few days later.   we never saw that woman again.  yay.

316,but it's expired...,"first time poster and user. :)

information: the store i work at is a tiny chain in the area i live. we markdown the food products when the expiration date on them is getting close and put them on shelf with a 25% or 50% discount sign. we pull them around the beginning of the month and throw them out around the end.  anyway...

m=me

c= customer 

k=manager/keyholder

storytime: it's a slow night, hardly anyone in the store cause of the cold. i'm organizing anything i can out of boredom when i see a lady at the counter. she has 2 things on the counter: an unopened pack of washcloths and a bag of these chocolate covered cherries. 

m: ""is this all you're getting today?""

c: ""no i'm returning this."" she hands me the receipt, i look it over.

now, her receipt matched what she had there, but the price of the cherries on it was ""$0.00"" when this happens it means that the food product expired and were not allowed to sell it by policy. that immediately struck me as odd, especially since a different manger was the one who did the sale (the name of the cashier is at of the end of the receipt). i just think to myself ""oh well she probably didn't notice it and she's returning it anyways. no harm."" did the return, gave her back her $ for the washcloths etc.  but...she's still standing there...

m: ""oh i'm done, you don't have to sign anything else.""

c: ""no, i wanted to buy these cherries.""

m: (realizing my mistake and hoping these don't ring up as $0) ""uhhh... sure."" (rings up as $0) ""i'm sorry, i can't sell these, they're coming up as expired."" 

c: she huffs and says ""well when i bought them the other day the lady didn't give me a problem and they're still on the shelf!"" 

m: ""she might've not noticed, because she would've thrown the others away if she had known."" i try to explain to her the error and how were not allowed by policy to sell them. she asks to see the manager. i call up k, and i explained the situation. he tries to tell her the same thing, but she is stubborn. scratches his head and sighs then says....

k: ""they're worthless to the store now so... (hands her the cherries) you can just have them. eat at your own risk!"" 

c: ""well i still want a receipt! i don't wanna walk around with something i didn't pay for!!"" 

k: (rips off the copy of her receipt from the return and hands it to her) ""there's your receipt! have a good night.""

she walked out in a irritated huff. i immediately walked over to the shelf, threw away the cherries and checked for anything else that was expired.  why someone would want expired food is beyond me.",SeraphShepherd,tfr
317,you threw out my daughter's shoes?!,"okay so first, i just want to say that i was absolutely in the wrong here. but, it's a funny story anyways.

&amp;#x200b;

it's the middle of the week and just after dinner time in the shoe store where i'm an assistant manager. the store is basically empty except for this one woman and her kid. people steal all the time in our store, and we're specifically told to keep an eye out. now i'll watch people, but i have a lot of other things to do so admittedly, i don't keep a super close eye on our customers.

i'm running around the store, glancing at this lady and her daughter who have been in the store for about two hours now. the daughter is trying on shoes and walking around in them, normal enough.

about 30 minutes later, i pass by that section of the store again and i don't see them. they did make a mess though, so i go to clean it up and find a box with old, dirty shoes in it. people do this all the time. they take their shoes off and leave them in the now empty box, thinking we'll never find it.

so i assume that the mom and her kid stole the shoes and toss the old, nasty ones. about another 30 minutes later there's this same woman screaming that she can't find her daughter's shoes anywhere. i had no idea this lady was even still in the store. (our store is huge. literally the biggest location there is.)

anyway, i go up to her and flat out tell her i threw them away. of course, she starts yelling at me. it was mostly gibberish, so i don't remember what she said exactly. but i do remember going over to our trash can, reaching in and pulling out her kid's disgusting sneakers. there was nothing else in the trash can, because we just took out the trash. so her kid's shoes didn't get disgusting because they were in a trash can. i tell all of this to the lady in an appropriate manner, as well as apologize for throwing out the shoes.

the woman demanded to look in the trash can and told me it was filthy, and now her daughter's shoes were equally filthy. then she asked me why i did what i did. i explained to her that i found a box with used shoes in it, didn't see anyone around and just assumed they were stolen. she yelled at me some more, which was also expected.

then she asks me what i'm going to do for her since her child can no longer wear the shoes that i threw away (even though they were literally fine, aside from whatever damage her daughter originally did to them). i tell her that i'll give her 10% off the pair that she was planning on buying. however, that isn't good enough. i ask her what kind of discount she was thinking, and this woman actually asks for 50% off. i tell her that isn't possible, and we end up settling on 15% off.

obviously, i shouldn't have thrown out those shoes, but this woman was also a tad extreme. she didn't lose her daughter's shoes, they weren't even dirtied by the event. my supervisor said i was right not to give her 50% off, but i did feel really bad about the whole thing.",BrokenIntoxication,tfr
318,give me the discount!,"i worked at a certain large printing/shipping company for almost 10 years and can think of many stories that would fit here, this one always sticks in my mind when i am telling people about the customers we dealt with. 

&amp;#x200b;

a customer called in to get a price on a print job and spoke with another employee, then said he would be in to place the order. when he came in, i happened to be the one that was available to help him and i begin to enter his order details. i get to the end with the price and it is a bit more than he was told over the phone. i don't know if he did not give the correct details on his call, or the other employee entered it in wrong, but it was pretty far off, but its not like he was given something in writing. 

&amp;#x200b;

the customer now says ""i was quoted this price"" and i try to keep my cool and say i'm sorry sir, but this is the correct price based on what you need printed. hes starting to get annoyed and then says to me ""give me the (insert company here) discount"". 

now side note, this company was a major client of ours, and has a very large presence in this town, and most businesses will give those employees a discount when they show their id. at my work, it was a huge discount, around 75% depending on what was being produced.

&amp;#x200b;

i then ask him ""do you work for this company? can you show me an id?"" and he flat out says ""no i don't work there, but give me the discount"". so i tell him i am unable to give the discount to any non employees of this company, and he follows up with ""yes you can"". we went back and forth on this for a couple of minutes. i finally get to the point where i tell him he will need to speak to the manager (who was not in at the time) and i walk away to cool off for a minute. when i come back to the counter the next customer jokingly says ""hey so i'm going to need that (company) discount"" and i couldn't help but laugh.

in the end he ended up paying the normal price and even apologized when he picked up the order.",jayXred,tfr

320,i help an elderly man and his wife is angry,"so i worked in a store that sells a little of everything. groceries, toys, furniture, some accessories, etc. it is kind of a catch all store. i was the cashier. i do returns, manage the carts at the front, keep the front clean. i am also the first person you see when you walk in. 

on this day a car drives up to the front and an elderly man gets out. he has to be at least 70 years old. he has parkinson's, which i learn later (this is important to the story). he walks in and goes over to the watches, i greet him and get a sense of what is going on. he bought a watch a day ago, the band is made of chain mail, and he can not get it off.  i try the best i could to get it off with my fingers, but this watch would not budge. i ask him to find a new one he likes better with a leather band and i will get someone to help me figure out how to get the watch off. i really did not want to hurt him. he was very thin and shook quite a bit. he reminded me a lot of my grandpa. i was going to help this man do or die. 

by the time my coworker comes to the front the mans wife comes inside and is complaining that it is taking forever. i explain that 1. i can't do a return without getting the old merchandise back and 2. i was not going to let her husband leave with a watch on his wrist that was obviously causing him pain and panicking him. she grumbled and told him she would be in the car. we end up tag team taking the watch off. my coworker gently using the screwdriver and i holding under the watch, mostly to keep pressure off of him. when he left he was ecstatic. i even set the time on the new watch and helped him put it on, making sure it came off easily. word of the wise, stay away from chain mail watches.

321,"""he's a known felon"" tl;dr included","now obviously i'm changing names for this post because this is all allegedly true but i don't know anything for sure and don't know all the details for myself. this is complicated so i included all the details i know but it's long so tl;dr at the end. the cast of characters in this tale include:
me: cashier at a department store, working the women's side tonight
alexis: fellow cashier, working the men's side tonight
hannah: a very nice floor employee
gina: a manager
brenda: the store manager 

so gina asked me to go to the men's side to take back the pile of things that people didn't want because alexis was over there alone and couldn't take them herself. i go over there and grab some things and start putting them back where they go. i start taking things a little bit at a time according to what goes close together.

 i take some stuff and come back to the register and see a man talking to alexis and gina. he asks gina to page a girl, we'll call her anna. gina pages anna to the men's registers  and goes to do other things. the man says he is going outside to wait and asks alexis to pass along the message. he goes outside. we think nothing of it, people lose each other all the time. 

i go to take some more things back. i come back to the register after taking a while to find where stuff goes. as i approach the registers a different man is talking to alexis, she's confused and standing a good distance away from him. judging from body language he looks like the disorderly type. he walks out and i ask her what that was about. she said he asked if we paged anna, and that she told him yes. 

i guess hannah heard this conversation because she asked gina and brenda if the loss prevention man (the closest thing to security we have) was there, i figured she saw the man acting strange or saw him steal something (we aren't allowed to call out a thief even if we see them attempt to steal for safety reasons) i went to put something back and noticed the same item in clearance so i went to a register to check it.

hannah comes up to me while i was at the register and told me that if the man comes back in, i need to let her or brenda know because he is a known felon in our area. i told her that i wasnt actually on this side but called over alexis since she was stationed closest to the door. 

later, when i'm almost done taking things back i grab a couple things that go to customer service, when i get back there the employee is looking confused. she said that someone called and asked us to page someone and tell them that their ride is waiting. we ask gina over the walkie if we are allowed to do that but she doesnt tell the managers the name of the person. gina say to just page them to the women's register and we will tell them when he gets there. the customer service girl reaches for the phone when brenda says ""wait who is it?"" the customer service girl freezes. i tell her she must be worried it's someone looking for anna again and i tell brenda that its not anna, its some guy they were picking up.

the supposed felon didn't come back. i hope anna is alright.
tl;dr: two different men are looking for the same girl, my coworker recognizes one of them as a local known felon. management is worried.",screech2thevoid,tfr
322,get your ladder out of my way!!,"btw i’m on mobile so sorry about the formatting etc. (also this is my first post). 

i used to work for a japanese clothing company in the uk but have been working in retail for over a year now so i have quite a few stories. 

one day i was tasked to help out preparing for a new campaign, which meant moving shelves and rails around and changing the posters (which were pretty high up), i’m quite comfortable working on ladders because i used to work as a carpenter for a few years, which is probably why they (managers) always asked me to help with the layout changes. 

one day cl (crazy lady) rushes into the store and without hesitation trys to push the ladder out of her way while i was on it holding onto a large poster. luckily i was able to balance myself but still really surprised. this is how that interaction follows:

me: hey ma’am, please don’t touch the ladder. (with my best customer service smile)

cl: get your ladder out of my way!

me: i’m sorry ma’am but i’m currently putting up a poster, if you’re looking for some help i’ll be happy to grab someone for you.

cl: i dont need any help youre in my way.

i’m a pretty chill dude but i do have a bit of a temper when really annoyed. this lady not only tried to push the ladder that i was on and almost injure myself but had the audacity to tell me to get out of my way. 

i will add that i made sure that there’s plenty of space for customers to move around. 

i was getting really annoyed but luckily before i could say anything the security guard was nearby and saw what was happening. the told the lady to not distract me while i was on a tall ladder and to continue shopping. cl listened to the guard. apparently she caused quite a fuss at the tills (item not correctly price yadda yadda) and did not buy anything. 

as i was finishing up with the ladder she was leaving and as she walked past i said with the fakest customer service smile on my face “is that enough space ma’am”.  she looked angry but left without saying anything. ",paul_vive,tfr
323,a kid and her change jar (cute and funny story),"hello again. i got another story for ya'll. i hope you like this one too. 

this story takes place before i was transferred to the gas station. i was a cashier at the main store for several years and i have several good stories from this as well. this one takes place on a late spring day when i was running a register on the express lane. it was actually fairly quiet day and i was busy cleaning my counter when i see a little girl who couldn't be more than 8 years old walking over to me. 

she was struggling with a shopping basket that had several tubs of ice cream and a box of popsicles as she made her way over. i greet her and reach over to help her with her heavy (for her anyway) load. she was very excited to be able to buy all the sweet treats and was chattering away while i rang her up. as soon as i finished i told her the total she pulls out a change jar from her jacket and dumps the jar on my counter. there are a few small bills but it's mostly change. i quickly check to make sure that there aren't any customers coming and i am relieved that the store is still quiet. i quickly set to work counting all the change with the little girl. 

so as soon as i finish i realize to my dismay that she is 78 cents short. i tell the child this and she looks at me with a perfect puppy eyes look and says ""but i really wanted all the ice cream..."" i was wondering what to do next as i see another customer, a middle aged woman, coming over to my line. i was wondering if i should even suggest taking one of the items off the list. the girl asks again and i read off the totals and repeat that she is indeed 78 cents short.

now i normally don't carry any cash or change on me but this day was different as i had some cash i was planning to use to get a bite to eat after work. i start digging into my pocket for a $1 bill and i spot the other customer digging into her purse as well. all of a sudden the little girl pulls out a $20 bill and hands it over to me.

both the customer and i look in shock and i ask the little girl ""i thought you said didn't have enough"" she replies ""it's from my sister, but i wanted to pay for everything myself to prove i'm a big girl now."" i smile and tell her ""you've certainly proven yourself today"" as i give her the change for the big bill. 

the little girl happily grabs the bags of goodies and literally skips (seriously i don't see many kids doing that anymore these days) out the exit. the other customer and i look after her and we couldn't help but laugh about the whole thing. 

if some of you are wondering what the funny bit was i'll explain. the girls original total was around $18 and both the customer and i knew that if the little girl had simply gave me the $20 she could have saved her own money for another day and it would have been very simple transaction for everyone involved. but still she wanted to do it herself and so she did. it was one of the cuter transactions i've ever had in my 8+ years of being in retail.",Goldstartankexpert,tfr

(also, this was back in 1999-2000 so there were no smartphones and the internet was still building steam.)   bc = book clubber.  


me - ""thanks for calling \*bookstore\*  this is me, how can i help you?""

bc - ""hi, i was wondering if you have this book i heard about in stock?""  
me - ""i can certainly check for you, just tell me the title.""  
bc - ""uhm...well i don't remember.""  
me - ""all right,..do you recall the author's name?  maybe i can narrow it down.""  
bc - ""no, i don't remember that either.""  
me - (oh dear god...)  ""well, where did you hear about this book?  can you tell me what it's about?""  
bc - ""it's about this woman,...and oh i remember the cover!  it was pinkish purple colored and there's a silhouette of a woman.""  
me - (so glad this person can't see my face ) - ""ma'am, did you hear about this book on oprah?""

bc - ""yes!  it sounded so good, some friends of mine are all wanting to read it.""   
me - ( we actually have a list on hand at the front desk of the most recent oprah's book club titles because we have a huge display of them in the center aisle)  ""all right, that's a good start.  was it  \*title of the most recent book on the list\*?""   
bc - ""no, i don't think so.""   
me - ""well, when was it that you heard about this particular book?  i have a list of titles here with the dates they were advertised.""  
bc - ""how am i supposed to remember that?  it's a pinkish purple book with a woman's silhouette on the cover, it will say oprah's book club on there!""  
me - (ready to bang my head on the desk, but speaking as politely as i can) - ""ma'am, with the promotion of her book club, i can tell you that most of the books on her list have been reissued for special sale with a cover that is some shade of pinkish purple and over half of those have some sort of silhouette on the cover.  i'm the person who is in charge of that display.  if you can't remember the title or the author, then *please* just come to the store and look for yourself.    we have at least 10 to 12 copies of every book she's mentioned on  her show in stock.""

bc - ""well, you don't have to be rude about it!""   \*hangs up\*

325,i mean... its not technically a banned pet so...,"theres this guy that comes into our store pretty often, which is expected since its a small town and we're the only store that sells some things like electronics, new furniture and housewares, various cheap office supplies, and underwear/bras. kid was a student at the local college, so he'd come in often for pens and notebooks and the like. the weird thing about him is that he'd have what looked like a tiny monkey under his hood. we don't actually have a store policy against it, just policies against non-service dogs and regular sized horses (country town, people are stupid, yes we've had problems with it before). since he always had his hood up we never really noticed until one of us saw eyes poking out on top of his head. the monkey's really well behaved too- its never an issue at all. it just chills there, wrapping its tail around his ponytail. never really asked him about it- closest i've got to it is when he caught me staring at his hood since i saw it move, and he quickly whipped his hood down, showing it to me, then popped it back up, winked, and walked away.


tldr: regular customer keeps his tiny pet monkey under his hood. no one does anything because of a loophole. its never an issue, anyways.",AlmightyJello,tfr
326,i don't know the definition of false advertisement,"a little back story before i get into the story, i work at a store that had a manager be fire, while she was fired a while ago her lack of care to the store is still something we're trying to clean up so there are a lot of ""10% off"" stickers over random items. my new manager just found all those items and sent them back to the store since they were actually discontinued, so none of those ""10% off"" items are not on the shelf, but people do have a bad habit of just putting something where ever they want instead of in it's actual spot. 

now for the story
al - is annoying lady
m - is me
im a cashier and was scanning this lady's items when this other lady, i'm guessing it's her daughter, comes up with a bottle of shampoo. i scan her item and tell her total, 3.75 (i only remember because this happened like 2 hours ago). she looks confused and goes,

al:""i thought it said 10% off?""

i'm confused, because while we do have a sale on it's for 50% off certain items

m:""was it on that table over there?"" we had a table with all out sale items

al: ""no, but the tag said 10% off""

m: ""oh, those tags were left up by the old manager, we no longer have those items since they have been discontinued, i'm guessing someone just laid it down there then""

al: ""that's false advertisement then"" (i heard this a lot from people)

m: ""i'm sorry, but a customer has laid it down there so it's not really false advertisement if it's not for this item""

al: ""that's false advertisement then, you obviously don't know the definition for false advertisement""

m: ""i'm sorry, but i do know the definition of false advertisement, i'm sorry someone laid this item there, but it is not 10% off""

al: ""the customer is always right the store is always wrong, don't you know that"" 

then she left, after she paid for it anyways.",alex415413,tfr
327,threw a tamper tantrum over id,"this isn't an interesting story like other ones on this subreddit but i still talk about this to this day. i have dozens of stories like these but this is my favorite.

i worked at a gas station for a while, and at the gas station we mainly sold booze and cigarettes. on my second or third day i was on the register and had to get used to looking at ids so i requested all ids from everyone. because of this i've had grown adults act like children towards me. 

this older dude came in, early 50s, tall and big. mind you i'm 21 but i look 12, i'm 5'1, and less than 100 pounds. he asks for a pack of cigarettes and i scan them in, and ask for his id. he looked at me like i just hit his child or something, he was so angry from such a simple sentence.

customer: excuse me?

me: i'm sorry, but it's company policy for me to ask for your id. i'm still in training. 

customer: no it's fucking not! 

me: sir, please. 

he mumbled something and literally threw his id at my face. i just gave him my best smile, read over the id and entered his dob and gave it back to him. 

the entire time during that he was fuming about how he's blah blah years old, and i'm fucking stupid and whatnot. when the time to write his signature on the receipt came, he wrote ""fuck you!"" on it and stormed off. 

i hope his banked called him about that receipt because we store all of them.",snailtec,tfr
328,story about awesome customers for once.,"so this goes back about a decade. i was working part time at a department store chain in the town where i went to college. 

i was the only male working in the women's department. so i rarely ever got asked for help by customers. this is kind of a bummer because i like helping customers. 

the men's department bordered on the women's department and one day i saw an elderly man and woman looking around for an employee. i can't explain how i knew that's what they wanted but if you working retail you'll get it. 

it wasn't my department but the store was slow and the men's department was understaffed. i approached and asked if i could help. they were looking for those goofy grandpa shorts with the elastic waistband. (not their words obviously). i help the man find a couple pair and then stayed with his wife to continue looking for more while he tried on the first couple. i ended up helping them with a few other things for about an hour total. they were extremely friendly. just happy nice people that you love to help. the man even tried to tip me afterwards which i refused. 

the couple became my regulars. anytime they came to the store they found me. we were on a first-name basis and they showed me pictures of their grandkids. talk about how they've been married 60 years and all of the fun vacations they went on. i've always wanted to travel and they knew just about every cool place to go.  even if they didn't need help from me they still came to my register. i think they thought i got commission on sales. 

maybe a year later the wife comes up to me in the women's department and ask for help getting a suit for her husband. she's my favorite customer in the world so of course i agree. we talked about the nice weather and how everything is going.  we get to the suit department and i asked her if she knows what size he wears.  she told me wears a 36 waist and 32 inseam. i asked about the jacket she didn't know. i asked if we could call her husband and ask him but she said he was not at home. 
she thought it was a 36 also but that seemed kind of small. i said okay what about shirts maybe we can guesstimate based on the shirt size. she only knew large but not collar size. 

the husband was about my width but a little taller so i tried on a couple jackets and tried to guess as close as i could. i really feel bad about selling her a suit that i wasn't sure was going to fit. i said maybe we should just wait until you can bring your husband in with you to try things on. 

she looked at me with this expression that almost seemed apologetic. ""[elderly man] passed away two days ago. the suit is for his casket.""

i didn't know what to say. i felt terrible. i told her i was very sorry and that i would miss him. i wanted to give her a hug. i wanted to come to the funeral. i wanted to offer to help her if she needed anything. so many thoughts and feelings running around i couldn't make sense of it. i came out of it after a couple seconds and realize that i was just her neighborhood department store employee. plus she had lots of kids to help if she needed. i decided i shouldn't try to intrude on their lives outside of the store unless she asked. 

so i went back to helping her pick out a suit. i never told her but this actually made it easier. 
i knew that the mortician could easily pin extra fabric in the back so i erred on the side of caution and picked out a suit that was probably too big. we also got a shirt, tie, and some fresh socks. 

i rung her up and we said our quick goodbyes like we always do and she left. i never saw her again. 

i'm not sure if she just started shopping somewhere else. maybe she moved in with her kids in the next town over.",dgl6y7,tfr
329,can i have these?,"i was working the night shift at a large store, my first job ever. i was kinda shy being new to the job market but was willing to face everything with a smile. my shift started from 10pm and didn't end until 7am, so i had a long shift ahead of me of mostly sitting there and listening to the music from the speakers with the occasional customer coming in to buy either smokes or whatever small things they needed.

it was a mostly quiet shift and i was already 3 hours in to my shift when this woman comes up to me with a small buggy of items. i was the only register open during the graveyard shift, so i took all items even over the normal 20 the register would normally allow.

&gt;me: good evening, ma'am! did you find everything okay?

&gt;lady: yes, i did. thank you for asking.

i'm casually ringing up her items and when i'm done and about to tally her total and ask how she was going to pay, she puts this smelly pair of worn shoes on the small table top. i swear if you looked hard enough you would see fumes, they smelled that bad. and that's coming from someone who has to share a sleeping space with a cat and the litterbox, so you can imagine how smells really affect me.

&gt;lady: i was wondering if i could have these. i found them behind some purses back in the clothing section.

&gt;me: i... don't know if i can let you have them. i'll have to ask my surpervisor about that. (i was just being polite and trying to dissuade her about taking these shoes. plus, i didn't actually know if i could let her have them.) unfortunately, they're not available right now.

&gt;lady: oh! that's fine! i'll be back in here tomorrow night, so can you ask your supervisor before you leave?

&gt;me: sure. i can do that. your price is [total]. will you be paying in cash or with a card?

she left after paying. no problems! except the smelly shoes. so when my lunch break came along, i spoke to my supervisor about the shoes and where the lady said she'd found them. since it seemed that someone had stolen a pair of new shoes and had put them somewhere nobody would really find them, i wasn't allowed to give her these shoes.

so for the rest of my shift, i was stuck behind my counter with the shoes underneath. every so often, i would spritz it with my small bottle of body spray in hopes it would kill the smell.

let's just say that winter apple and dirty feet don't mix.

the lady did come back the next day, but i told her that she couldn't have the shoes since it is apparent we are missing a product from the store. she understood thankfully.

for 5 days i stood there with the shoes while my managers went through the security footage. i quit after i had asked them 2 days in a row if i could move them someplace i wouldn't have to smell them under my nose and they refused. i don't see why i couldn't have them keep it in their security office. it was bad enough i had a concoction smell of cigarettes/skoal/cigars, i was also smelling these worn out sneakers.

i went back to that store about a year later. the shoes are still there. i feel sorry for whatever new night shifter works there and i hope they learn to breathe through their mouth or keep a simple floral spray with them at all times.

330,quit calling me!,"tldr at bottom. i’m on mobile so sorry if the formatting is a little off. 

 for some context, i work at a wholesale club in the bakery department. 30% of our duties is so decorate cakes for customers who order them. we have a 24 hour policy for custom orders but if you just want happy birthday on a display cake, it’ll take 5 minutes. 

 when it gets closer to the weekend, we have to stress this policy very intensely, as people aren’t aware we’re slightly understaffed and weekends almost wreck us with how many orders we have. we try doing our cakes the day before to help the weekend situation but with our whipped icing, it’s a 50/50 chance it’ll come out perfectly as it absorbs the color easier than regular icing.

 so, this lady comes in with her two kids and is trying to order a minecraft cake. the picture she’s showing me is all covered in fondant decorations, which we don’t do. eventually we come to a middle, since she has toys, to just airbrush both tears of cake in colors that go along with the photo. easy enough. 

 the weekend comes, she doesn’t. we get it, sometimes you get busy, or the party’s cancelled and you forget to call. no biggie. usually we wait until the end of the day for a pickup and if they’re a no-show, we call the next day at a reasonable time. 

 my coworker called her and she didn’t answer. left a voicemail, okay. next day, tried calling again but got a voicemail. i left this one, told her about our attempts to reach her. 

 two days after we called, our supervisor tried. the lady picked up, clearly hushed and started cussing out my coworker. there was a lot of “i have kids! quit calling me to wake them up!” and “i don’t know who you are but i’m tired of this!” she attempted to let the customer know about her cake but got as far as “m’am we have-“ before she screams, “i don’t want whatever it is! stop calling me!” and she hangs up. 

 a week later she’s back ordering another cake for her other kid. 

edit; i forgot to add that between her order being placed and when we called, we had called her to confirm that’s what she’d wanted since she was sort of iffy on the design. she kept saying things like “yeah that’s fine i guess” and “whatever you want.” (edit 2: spelling mistakes)

tldr; lady places an order for a cake, doesn’t show up and doesn’t give us a chance to tell her about it when we finally reach her. ",18_bee,tfr
331,beer soaked leather jacket,"my first retail job was at a leather jacket store (it wasn’t all leather, a lot of it was pleather jackets, some name brand coats wallets purses etc.) it was like a lot of just any other retail store. i was 17 at the time and i’ve been working there for a couple months. it started out as just a seasonal position but they hired me because of my perky/bubbly attitude that brought in a lot of sales. mind you this is my first job in retail so i was very naive and really didn’t have any problems with helping customers. that is until one night. 

our company rules is that we don’t return anything that has been obviously used because it has no resale value. that one night, i was by my self in the store since it’s small and during a week night where it’s not as busy. my manager was in the back room eating on her break, and i was in the front checking sales from that day. a woman came in maybe a couple hours before closing and was obviously intoxicated. she wanted to return her leather jacket. this leather jacket was soaked in beer. i apologized and told her because of company policy i cannot return this. 

and that set her off. 

she started screaming in my face and threw the heavy leather jacket at me. she continues to call me names (like a bitch and c*nt) and and idiot that can’t do a job right. i try to calm her down but it goes over deaf ears. she continues to scream at me and i tell her that the best i can do is get my manager. so i run to the back room to get my manager and stay in the back room to cry. i also smelled like beer. 

when i returned, my manager decided the best way to get the lady out of the store was to return the damaged leather jacket. with that we had to throw the jacket out (company policy if merchandise is damaged). we lost 300$ in sales because of that. 

this was just one little incident out of thousands i’ve dealt with while working 3 years in customer service. ",caitecait,tfr
332,returns desk hell,"okay so, this is the story of my first day on the returns desk.

it was a short 4 hour shift and before halfway through i had three customers angry with me about the no receipt/no return or exchange policy.

here's one interaction:

me: ""hi, how can i help?""

c: ""oh yeah, can i return these?""

me: ""sure! do you have the receipt with you?""

c: ""no, i was hoping to exchange this for this""

me: ""unfortunately, i can't do an exchange without a receipt""

c: ""are you kidding me?""

me: ""no, that is our policy-""

c: ""so you can't even exchange one thing for the exact other thing in another size""

me: ""no, so-""

c:""that is absolutely ridiculous, it is my sisters (item) and it didn't fit her and she is in hospital and........(kept trying to make me sympathise)""

me: ""i'm sorry about that, but unless you have a valid receipt i can't put it through for you.""

c swears at me and walks away.

&amp;#x200b;

then i had a customer who had stole an item of clothing, phone in to say that she would be back on friday to collect her missing keys and phone.

&amp;#x200b;

then 30 mins before i was meant to finish a lady came over telling me that she had a huge return for me. i was like sure! this won't take longer than 30 minutes. 

it was 3 reciepts worth of stuff longer than my arm, which was about $200 worth of stuff, i had to find the item on the receipt put it in the system ect.

the return didn't take longer than 30 minutes, but then she handed me a basket. $70 dollars of stuff (the $1- $3 stuff)

""okay, that's $130 dollars back to go onto your card-""

her friend comes over with another full basket, another 70 dollars.

she ended up handing me about $350 of stuff.

334,"no, this brush doesn't have ""woman hair"".","new to this sub, sorry if i mess anything up c:

i used to work in retail for a month (and you'll know why i left very soon) and my first two weeks was in another store for training, and then i moved to my actual store. i worked in a cosmetics retail line as a makeup artist and our company does complimentary makeovers in the store if you send over a certain amount in a single receipt. our story happens one week before i leave, and i had already put in my notice and served half of it.

i was my store's only makeup artist and in that month, i got to meet a lot of amazing people! people would tell me stories while i was doing their makeup and it was a great way to interact casually and not have to constantly push for sales. cue crazy lady (cl), walking in while i was not doing anyone else's makeup, and so i approached her to ask if she was looking for anything specific. 

cl told me she was looking for multiple items (i don't remember exactly what, but i distinctly remember she said she wanted a blush brush). i would take her over to the displays and show her the testers and how they looked, and she said okay to this one lipstick. 

the staff generally should be the one helping to take out the actual product to hand to the customer if we are serving them, and since i was serving cl i helped her to take out the lipstick and hand it to her. everything's still cool.

she roams about for another few minutes, then goes back to the lipstick display and says:

cl: is this the shade i wanted?

me: yes ma'am, this is the shade you wanted.

i take out the tester again to show her, and she nods. then, she takes the lipstick that i gave her to hold on to, puts it on my counter (not even back in the display, where it should have been), and takes a new one to put in her basket. 

at this point i'm thinking, okay, maybe she prefers to help herself. that's fine, some customers just prefer that and i'm okay with it. 

this happens again, with another 3 products in which she keeps repeating her questions, taking the product i gave her, placing it on my makeup counter, and taking another herself. without her keeping the products i was giving her back in the display, that meant the display was going to be empty because there was a pile of makeup on my counter where i do makeup for people, and this doesn't look good at all.

i had multiple other customers ask me whether these certain products were out of stock and i had to say no, they're on my makeup counter, please help yourself. my manager didn't notice so i didn't get questioned as to why things were all over my desk. a few customers were really sweet and helped me to put things back. 

cl later asks for a blush brush.

cl: do you sell brushes?

me: yes ma'am, is there any specific kind you were looking for?

cl: yes, i'm looking for a brush to apply blush.

me: sure ma'am, they're right over here.

i bring cl over to the brushes and show her a few, but she picks out one that's relatively cheap and made of synthetic fibre (not natural hairs like goat, etc).

cl: does this brush have woman hair?

me: uh, i'm not sure i understand ma'am?

cl: does it have like, woman's hair? is the brush made out of woman's hair?

this lady is pretty damn loud, and so other customers and my coworkers are staring. i'm only a month into my job, so this was the first really weird customer i had and i got some pitiful looks. 

me: no ma'am, this is synthetic fibre. it's made of nylon. 

cl: okay...

cl puts the brush in her basket and in classic her-style, asks me 2 minutes later if the brush has ""woman hair"". i tell her no, she says okay, and then she asks me again!

she finally stops asking long enough to make her payment and at the cashier she asks me the same question about the brush again. i tell her no and bag her purchase and ask her (reluctantly) if she wants to have the makeover now because she spent over the required amount to qualify for it. i'm hoping she'll say no and come back when i've left my job, but she says yes.

i sit her down at the booth and we do eyebrow trimming as well, so i ask her if she wants her eyebrows done. she says yes, and that she only wants the eyebrow trimming and not the makeover. i explain to her that if she doesn't want the makeover, the session still counts and she says it's okay. 

now cl barely has any eyebrows. she's in her 50s, maybe 60s, and generally this means only plucking the stray hairs and trimming down the longer hairs. at the most, maybe 15 minutes. 

i take one hour to get her done because any time i think she can't have any less eyebrow hair, she eyes the mirror and asks to trim a little more. lady, this is a thirty dollar service, not a hundred dollar service. i'm tempted to just shave off everything and ask her if that's thin enough brows for her. 

when i'm finally done, i'm already 30 minutes late for my lunch (thankfully my manager is chill and not too strict with times, so i still get my full lunch hour) and cl thanks me for the service and leaves. as per my usual spiel i tell her if she wants another makeover or trimming she'll have to spend the required amount in a single receipt again, blah blah and that if she wants to get it done next week, she'll have to go to the other outlets as the outlet i'm at won't have another makeup artist for now. she says okay, and finally leaves.

i go to the storeroom to change into my slippers and get my wallet and phone so i can go for my late lunch, and suddenly my coworker comes into the storeroom.

coworker: rexcaliburrr, your customer is back.

me: oh god.

i go outside, and cl is there.

cl: the brush doesn't have woman hair right?

me, wanting to die: no ma'am, it doesn't.

cl: and if i want to do the makeover i have to spend the money again right?

me: yes ma'am.

cl: okay.

cl leaves, and i go to grab my things. as i'm walking out of the store, cl comes back in and asks the exact. same. questions. i respond exactly as i did earlier, and she leaves again. before she can come back, i just bolt out of my store and run off to go get my lunch in case she comes back again.

for my last week of work i prayed she wouldn't come back and thankfully she didn't and i was able to enjoy my last week in peace and without being asked if brushes had ""woman hair"" in them.",Rexcaliburrr,tfr
335,rabid monster loose in toy store,"a few years ago i worked at a certain large toy store that is no longer with us, rip. i worked seasonal there for 2 years. it might sound like a nightmare job to some, what with dealing with stressed parents during the busiest time of the year, it was fun for me most of the time. i found i work well in retail, usually going into a sort of customer service trance where not much fazes my usually easily anxiety ridden self.

 anyway, during my second year , that mode was pushed to its limit quite a lot, the manager was awful and thievery was rampant, but that's another story. this one is about the one time i had to deal with a genuine monster.

it was somewhere in the middle of the shopping season (after black friday, before christmas eve) . i was stationed in girls toys that day but a coworker asked me to help with a customer who was looking for a specific foam dart gun, since according to almost all my coworkers, i knew where everything was. i'd like to think that was true but only in a broad sense. 

i got to the foam dart aisle to find a rather large man and his somewhat timid wife standing there, looking over the shelves of the largest foam dart guns. i offered my services and the man was very calm, but clearly sounded like he had gone over this a few times already. lets call him bruce.

bruce:""ok, we are looking for the bs300 series gun, its yeay big"" he said holding out his arms ""and is supposed to come with a gatling gun attachment. this one "" he points to a gun that looks almost exactly like what he wants ""is not it. i know its not. i saw it on tv. i've asked three people already, you have to have it. "" 

me: ""alright, i am sorry you are having trouble, i  can go take a look in our system for you and make sure we have it in stock. you are welcome to follow me or wait here to keep looking if you like. i will be back in just a moment"" 

i head over to the desk we use for various services and begin looking up the item he mentioned, typed the number in the search for the type of toy gun he was looking for, and ...... came up empty. as far as i could tell this gun did not exist. i then started to look up guns of the description he gave and only came up with the one he had adamantly said was wrong, and one of a completely different brand. i wrote the results down and returned, though a little nervous. something told me this wasn't going to go over well with him. 

""it seems the series number you told me isn't coming up with anything, but i did find a gun similar to what you said in the ""totally offbrand"" brand. "" 

wife: ""i think this one will be perfect for our boy. "" holds up a completely different kind of gun, one that is much smaller ""they love shooting targets in the back yard together, we are just looking for a pair of guns for him and our boy to use together. this one "" the gatling gun ""is going to be too big for him anyway. "" 

i wasn't entirely sure if she was talking to me or bruce at this point. i smile and nod, looking at them both, starting to feel relived that things were resolving well. 

""alright, i am happy you could find something. do you need any help with anything else?"" 

bruce is looking a bit steamy, a bit like a bomb with its fuse lit. ""no. we'll just keep looking"" 

""have a nice day"" i say cheerfully and go disappear into the pony aisle, thinking i was done and would move onto the next. 

but this wouldn't be here if that was the case. oh no. 

a few minutes later i hear bruce, now the hulk, bellow from the foam dart section

""these people are incompetent! f\*ing idiots, how do they hire people who can't do their f\*ing jobs!"" 

wife: ""dear, calm down, we found -"" 

i hear something like he had kicked one of the shelving units, but i am pretty sure that wasn't what he hit.

""shut the f\* up! you are as dumb as they are! ""

the wife remained silent the rest of his tirade.

he continues to explosively vomit profanities as they travel through the store, and by now have attracted the attention of our security personnel. i'm sure this guy could be heard across the store. i hear the code for rowdy customer who is a danger to others over our radios and actually help them locate the man. 

i then decide to take a quick break and escape to the break room before i nearly faint. i felt like i had just risked my life. over the radios i gathered that they 'escorted' the two out, but my customer service shell was cracked for the rest of my shift. ",blueberrybamf,tfr
336,the pissed off lady with bad luck,"i work in a supermarket at the bread section/bakery. we bake snacks, bread, baguettes and restock bread things. 

on weekdays i work with the people who work full time (35y/o +) and in the weekends i work with my peers (students 17-25). 

so this lady comes to get the same bread snack ((saucijzenbroodje) google if you are interested) on saturday. and always when she is there, it’s in the oven and it still has 20 minutes to go. she always responds the same: she sighs and walks away angrily. 

during the week she comes by and complains about what a ‘disaster’ it is on saturdays to the full timers. 

so last week, she finally decides to order it, so we can lay it behind the counter for her to pick up later. and there was a mix-up but it was still in the store for her to get, but she decides that’s not good enough and whispered under her breath: ‘what an abomination’ and complained about it to our manager, while it was there for her to get. it’s so fascinating how many fucks she gave about a bread snack. 

tl/dr
a lady always comes on saturdays to her favorite bread snack, but it’s always in the oven when she comes. when we finally got her the snack she still complained. ",ohqueen,tfr
337,an actual heartwarming story,"so i work at a store that sells art supplies, toys, and home decor. we have this program called everyday value where certain items from our in-house brands are price-locked and no coupons or discounts work on them. we get plenty of customers who don't like this policy, and for good reason since we've been expanding it, which means regular-price-item coupons don't work half the time. definitely annoying.

anyways, it was christmas eve and unfortunately i was on register until close. working on christmas eve sucked, but i tried to be cheerful for the customers and wished them a merry christmas and all that. but there was one customer that i still think about to this day.

so a girl comes to the register, maybe in her late teens, and wants to buy a rolling shelf cart thing. she said she'd been eyeing it for weeks and saving up enough to buy it. now these carts are everyday value, so any coupons that she wanted to use wouldn't have worked. i think she knew this and made sure she had enough to cover the base cost of the cart, about $30. unfortunately, she forgot about sales tax. in my state, sales tax is 6%, so her total came up to $31.80, meaning she didn't have enough money to buy it.

when she counted her money to see that she couldn't afford the cart, her face dropped. she was so upset that she couldn't afford something she'd been eyeing for weeks and i felt terrible for her. i could tell she was broken up on the inside even though she was managing a smile on the outside. 

after some banter between me and her, i decided ""fuck it, it's christmas eve"" and did something i wasn't technically supposed to do: i manually applied a full transaction discount, reducing the price from $31.80 to about $23. now, she had more than enough cash to buy the cart. when i did that, she was over the moon. her face lit up and if she could've jumped over the counter to give me a hug and kiss, i feel she would've. she thanked me profusely and told me i made her day. she practically danced out of the store with her stylish new storage cart, still thanking me until she was out the door.

it was a small thing, but the small things can make people the happiest. and while, yes, i have experienced horror stories, the positive stories are what i like to remember.",abstruseglitch,tfr
338,woman tries to donate animal furniture at discount store,"i worked at a discount store (op shop). we sell second hand books/media/toys/cloths/homewares and manchester. most of these are delivered to us as donations. it was a hot day and this woman comes into the store with donations clearly for pets mid afternoon (we do not sell pet stuff). i was the only one out back sorting through a pile of dvds when she shows up. she has a used pillow and a whole heap of doggy toys. i told her “sorry we don’t sell that sort of stuff here” and she cracks it saying “are. you. fucking. kidding me.” she starts swearing like a sailor and walks off. i watch as she stays by her car for the next ten minutes presumably swearing before she gets in and drives off.

339,working as the owners son at a gas station,"hi there. this is my story about me working at a gas station.

context: my mum owned a esso gas station where we used to live. we had to sell it when we got posted out of the town and i was sad as the new owners were quite annoying always talking to the district manager or my mum. i think the dm is looking to give the store to anyone

 we had it for about 10 months and i worked there as a casual. (casual meaning i worked every once and a while). i was a cashier and had turned 14. in the province i lived the legal age to sell tobacco and be a cashier is 14. i would work holidays like boxing day,easter,may long,march break to give the other employees time off. it was great working there and actually got payed 14$ an hour which is more then i should have. i typically worked from 10-3 and 9-12 and the one time worked after school. i got treated to free takeout from my mum as it was me,dad and mum working. my parents were doing gas i was doing cash and it was a great experience. i saw teachers from my elementary school, and some of my mum friends i was good at my job only needing a few mins to learn what to do. the hardest part was selling cigarettes as we had so many.

&amp;#x200b;

the store was quite small we had a ice cream freezer,pepsi coke fridges and chip rack in the middle a water bottle exchange place,candy bars in front of the register,keriug machine,and a couple other things. i miss that place a lot and i made friends with my co-workers/mum's employees

340,“employees only” door,"i work in a supermarket but the building is quite old so “the back” is separate from the main building. for this reason, there is a door in the near the edge of the store that serves as a shortcut to the back.  the door clearly states “employees only”.  this is because otherwise people could just hop in, get some stuff and hop out again without going through the cash register. 

me: me

wm: weird man

so i was just getting something from the back as i’m approached by wm. 

wm: hey! is it okay if i just go through this door real quick? 

me: no, this door is for employees only

wm: well you can make an exception just this once. 

then before i can say anything he’s already inside. by then i couldn’t really kick him back out so i just keep an eye on him and make sure he pays for his stuff.

341,no one is holding a gun to your head...,"hi again! been a long time since i last posted and i probably have content for the next 12 years but i just remembered this story and thought it might be worth sharing.


i work at a bakery/cafe/deli that caters to a...more affluent crowd...and we sell freshly made salads in our deli case. 

things like moroccan style chickpea salad, greek salad, tomato feta and basil salad, shrimp in chilli oil, fennel &amp; apple salad, etc. 

these are all priced per 100g (sorry americans i don’t know the equivalent in whatever it is you measure in) but we generally operate on the idea of small/medium/large so a lot of customers get confused when their medium salad priced at $3.30 per 100g ends up being $9. 

well the worst offender for this is our shrimp in chilli oil which costs $8 per 100g, which we tend to say ends up being $1 per shrimp. 

now in walks a middle-aged white woman with her husband. she’s just gonna be w for woman and i’ll be e for employee, i guess.

e: hi there can i help with anything?

w: yes, could i please have a small greek salad, a small cabbage salad, and a medium shrimp? 

e: of course!

now like i said, we usually let the customer know that the shrimp come out to be $1 a shrimp, so a medium can be anywhere from $25-$40. i forgot to mention this of course, but at the same time the price is listed right on the placard in front of the shrimp, though we all know customers can’t read signs.

so i hand her the salads, all is well, and she heads over to the cash register...oh no wait, she’s turning around, heading back to my station...

w: $35 for shrimp!? i’m sorry that’s ridiculous, i can make it for less at home! are you sure this price is correct!?

e: well it looks right, our shrimp is $8 per 100g so it can add up quickly...would you like me to re-weigh it just in case?

w: please!

so i weigh it and it checks out, it’s a totally normal price for the product, but she is obviously not having it. after getting an earful again about how it’s “so expensive” and we’re “overcharging” i chose to just say the single greatest line i’ve ever thought of in the heat of the moment:

e: no one’s forcing you to buy it. if you don’t want to pay that price, you don’t have to take it.

w: oh...uhhh...ya, i’m sorry, it’s just a little bit too much for me.

e: sure, no problem! have a great day.


like i get it, i would never pay $35 for shrimp, but at the same time you decided to order it. the price is clearly marked and you can order it via size or you can order per 100g if you’re that concerned about price. the big thing here is that there is no reason to yell at me about pricing, especially when it comes to something you have order in the exact quantity you want!!! i didn’t put a medium container of shrimp in your basket, you asked me for it. you physically walked up to my counter, looked inside, noted to item you wanted and the price, and asked me to provide it to you. don’t blame me for your lack of comprehension when it comes to price or weight. and even if it was too expensive i get customers all the time who apologize profusely and decide they don’t want it and i just take it back because i get it. anyway, ya! so annoying!!!

342,begging for... sushi?,"well since my last post surprised me with it's reception i figured i would share another story. i think this can easily fit in this category as well as choosing beggar but i will stick with this one for now. 

sg= sushi girl.
cw= co-worker

a bit of background for those who may not know already, i am a 22 year old supervisor at a gas station that is linked to a larger retail store across the parking lot. i mostly work afternoons and evenings. 

now i know every employee who works at this small store and whenever i clock in i always check with the morning crew so i can be up to date on what is going on that day. one morning two of the morning crew pulled me aside after i clocked in and told me of an incident they had to deal with that morning.

they told me that a younger woman they dubbed sushi girl (sg)had come over to them with a package of fresh sushi. sb asked what the expiration date is on the package. they answer and sg replies ""isn't that tomorrow?"" they confirm her assumption and it begins.
sg asked ""why do you sell it so close to its expiration date?"" they reply that we make the sushi fresh in the main store and shush doesn't have a very long shelf life already. sg then asks ""since it's going to expire soon, could i get it for free? i used to work at another store just like yours and they let me get free sushi all the time."" the morning staff tell her that even though that may be the case in that store our store policy forbids giving out food for free. 

now i feel like i have to explain myself here. as much as i would like to be able to give out free food and i have talked to my boss about it and i was told that our company is looking into it but there is a lot of legal issues and red tape to go through. also i know that once you start handing out freebies it tends to attract the wrong kind of people that would only cause us more trouble. so as much as i would love to be kind and help it wouldn't be the best idea in this situation. even the employees don't get food for free here.

now, back to the story...

sg begins to rant to the morning crew about how she needs free food and that there are many starving people in the city we are in. they thankfully hold their ground and refuse to give the single pack of expensive sushi away. so after trying to guilt trip the morning crew sg changes tactics and instead tries to get them to sell it at a major discount which they also refuse. sg finally gives up and leaves the store in a huff. 


after the morning crew finishes telling me i tell them they did the right thing and i silently hoped that she would try again while i was there so i could get a chance at stopping this sort of behavior. now i am not normally a mean person but when any customers mistreat my coworkers i can get very worked up about it as i am their supervisor and their friend and i don't like seeing this sort of thing happen. but i figured sg wouldn't try to pull this stunt at my store again. little did i know i would actually get my wish.

fast forward a week and i am working on christmas eve with some different coworkers when i spot a younger looking woman coming over to a cw with a case of the expensive sushi. i think nothing of it until i overhear a bit of the conversation between them. the woman was asking my coworker about the expiration date on the sushi. it then hits me. sg is back!

i then move nearer to my cw and continue to listen. sg asks since the sushi was about to expire if she could get it for free. cw says that he isn't allowed to do that and he would check with his manager (a.k.a. me) since i was already there i just moved over and told her i am the supervisor on duty that day and the fun begins. sg looks over at me and seems surprised that i am the supervisor. i'm used to this as i am 22 and look even younger so this reaction is normal. sg starts off by saying that she used to work at another store in the chain and how she would get the soon-to-expire sushi for free and sg asks if i would do the same. 

i braced myself for a possible angry customer situation and told sg that it was against store policy to give food away. sg sighs and says that there are a lot of starving people in our city and that we can make a big impact for good in the community by giving her this pack of expensive sushi for free. 

now the city this station is in is quite nice and is very developed and i haven't personally seen many poorer people around, let alone starving families. 

obviously i don't say this out loud but i do hold my ground about this being store policy. sg begins to ask for a large discount only to get the same response from me. sg decides to try one last plea. ""but it's christmas!"" i continue to hold my ground and explain why our company has this policy due to the governmental red tape. sg then says maybe she should write the state reps about this. i replied that it is our right as american citizens to do that sort of thing. 

that does little to console her and she continues to try to get a discount to no avail. she winds up paying full price for the sushi and she leaves the store in a huff. cw looks over at me and asks what the whole deal was. i simply tell him that we just dealt with sg. he looks shocked and i tell him he did good by standing his ground and following store policy. we closed up early for the holidays and i haven't seen sg since.

edit. i feel as though i should say that sg by no means looked poor or starving. sg was a fairly attractive woman and was dressed quite nicely so there was no doubt she didn't need to eat something right away or else.",Goldstartankexpert,tfr
343,having something thrown at me,"so over my years of retail experience i've had more than a few angry customers but having something thrown takes it to a new level. and i've had it happen twice. 

the first time my coworker and i were working the returns counter trying to whittle down the very long line. she was helping a man who was trying to return a doorknob. he apparently didn't like her answer and got upset. he turned around and threw the doorknob across the room. it nearly hit another customer and the person behind him told him to calm down but that only made him angrier. those two got in each other's faces and, since i had the radio, it was my responsibility to call for backup if need be. thankfully it ended shortly after with the doorknob man leaving. still, it left us both shaken.

the second time i was helping a gentleman who was trying to return one of those grabber arm things that old people like to use. he didn't have a receipt so i informed him that it would be the lowest sale price because we don't know what price it was whenever they bought it. he said fine until i told him that the lowest price was 1 penny. this only happens with a buy one get one free item. he wasn't happy with that. got mad and screamed a little and during all that i voided the return and gave him back the grabber. or at least i tried because he just took it and threw it at me. the grabber arm things aren't heavy so even if he had hit me it wouldn't have done much damage but it was the shock of it. i felt a little better though when the customer after him asked if i was okay and basically spent the whole transaction making sure it was a positive experience to offset that gentleman. 

tl;dr: returns are upsetting to people who don't get the money they want and sometimes they throw tantrums by throwing things.",ExposedAuthor,tfr
344,respect my space!," this isn't necessarily crazy, but here you go. i work at an outlet mall and it was summertime, so it was relatively busy and we had about 4 workers on at once (including myself). a woman came into the store and i greeted her with a typical ""hi, how are you today""  which she ignored and immediately started shopping. i asked her if she needed help and she said she didn't need any, so i left her alone to deal with some other customers. then about 10 or so minutes my coworker asked if she needed any help and again, she said no. so she left her alone and after about another 10 minutes she came up to the counter with her items and what she told my coworkers was something like this: 

""you know, i really didn't need help and you guys asked me about 6 times if i needed help (keep in mind we only asked if she needed help twice out of the whole 20 minutes she was there), it's very overwhelming when employees are too persistent when you're just trying to shop, you guys need to respect customers space. you just lost a customer"" 

she then proceeded to buy her items then left without saying another word. after she was gone my coworkers and i stood there for a minute then started laughing our butts off about how ridiculous she sounded. later my manager asked me how many times we actually talked to her and i just told her twice. she laughed about it as well.﻿ ",Fieryrain56,tfr
345,a temper tantrum 92 years in the making,"first post here. but it is certainly not going to be the last. i work as a evening/night supervisor at a busy gas station linked to a large retail store. i am 22 years old and i look younger so many customers don't realize that i am a supervisor and thus some very unusual interactions happen. but this story happens just before i was promoted. i will be sure to share more stories later but this is one of the better ones.

i was running the registers on a fairly busy fall evening when a old woman and her slightly younger looking friend walks in the door and she immediately starts yelling at me that she needs help. i take a moment to move away from the line of customers to see what is going on. the second she sees me looking over at her she lays into me about how her card did not work at the pump, how it's a brand new card and it has plenty of money on the account and how we are a terrible business for letting this happen to her at this late time in her life. 

i do my best to try to calm her and her friend is doing the same to no avail. just then my supervisor(i hadn't been promoted yet), having heard the commotion, walks over and asks what is going on. he receives the same treatment that i got and when she stops to take a breath he offers to go outside and pump her gas for her and she can pay for it inside when he finishes. she practically shouts ""as long as i get gas in my car i don""t care how its done!"" 

so my supervisor heads out of the store and begins pumping her gas. in the meantime i switch back to taking care of my customers who have now gathered in a fairly long line around our three registers. 

now our registers are on a counter in an l shape facing the door with one register on the short side and two on the long side.

the rage-filled woman moves over in front of the solitary register on the left side leaving me with only two to work with. i work as fast as i can using both registers at once. i would have used all three but the woman had planted herself in front of it effectively blocking it from being used.

during my frantic attempt to handle the still growing crowd the angry woman is still going on a rampage yelling at me, her friend, and the company in an admittedly impressive tirade.

about 10 minutes later my supervisor finishes pumping gas and comes back inside, he signals me to take care of her while he deals with the crowd. i ring her up and her card works on the first time without a single issue. 

after she pays she seems to calm down and begins to exit the store, but before she exits she leans back poking her head in the door again and yells ""i hope you turn 92 years old so you can be treated the same way you all treated me!"" at me. 

i take a second to process what she just said as the store becomes silent. a second later my supervisor, having finished with the majority of the crowd leans over and says ""i'm pretty sure she had put her card in the wrong way, don't take it too hard."" as he finishes the last customer in the group looks back at us as he is walking out of the store stops and leans back and says ""she did, i saw her try twice and then come in here."" he then leaves the store. 

my supervisor and i take a moment to realize what had just happened and then once we knew that there were no other customers we gave into a loud guffaw about the whole situation. this sort of thing happens quite a lot at my station, 80% of the time as soon as a employee looks into it everything works perfectly. 

this was one of the biggest temper tantrums i have personally seen, much less been on the receiving end of. if you liked this one i have a lot more stories to share so let me know if you would like me to.",Goldstartankexpert,tfr
346,"don't wanna pay $200 for your gas? enjoy paying $8,000 for a new dock.","kinda long; tldr at the bottom

&amp;#x200b;

i worked at a small marina on a lake during the summer from when i was seventeen all the way until i graduated college and moved away. for the most part, it was the summer job every high school/college student dreams of. my boss was super laid back, most of my customers were super rich nice retirees that tipped well, and if there were no customers i could read, mess around on my phone, swim in the lake, etc. to this day it was the most enjoyable job i've ever had. for the most part my customers were in a good mood when they came to get gas for their boats. i can count the number of irate/bad customers that i've had over the course of six years on both of my hands. this customer is the only one that i had ever had that tried to get away without paying. it didn't end well for him.

&amp;#x200b;

so i was manning the marina by myself that day; it was still the off season (pre-memorial day) and we were only open on weekends. most people were just starting to take their boats out of storage and business was super slow. it was nearing closing time, and i had a whopping total of three customers come by over the course of the day. didn't make a lot in tips. i didn't really mind though, as i had brought along my ds and had spent the time playing pokemon. i'm just about to head inside to start closing for the day when i see a boat speeding along to the dock. now my boss' rule for taking customers at the end of the day was ""take them at your discretion"" which basically translated to ""take them if you want or turn them away i don't really care."" i had nothing better to do, so i decide to just stay open a little late and help this guy out. i got a little excited when i noticed that this guy (let's call him mr. mingy moneybags, or mr. mm) had a really fancy new wake boat. the people who own these things are usually filthy rich and tip well, as wake boats usually have monstrous gas tanks that can hold 30-60 gallons of gas (my car, for reference, holds about 15 gallons) and their bills are usually very high. 

&amp;#x200b;

mr. mm pulls up to the dock and i helped moor his boat. i then start filling it up. i make myself comfy while i do this as mr. mm said his boat takes 50 gallons and was almost empty, so it would take a while to fill it. this was back in 2013 when gas was still super pricey, and we only sold ethanol free gas so the price was just over $4.00 per gallon. mr. mm complains to me about the price and i just shrug, saying that i'm not the one who decides what the prices are. he grows more and more agitated as the bill keeps climbing. i ask him if he's sure that he wants to fill up all the way. he just gives me a clipped ""yeah"" and continues to stare at the numbers ticking up on the pump. finally, 47 gallons of gas later, mr. mm's boat is filled and his bill comes out to just over $190 dollars. it was the most expensive bill i had ever seen up to that point. i turn to him and ask him how he's going to pay. he makes a show of patting his pockets and looking around his boat for a while. i just raise my eyebrows. he finally turns to me and says that he forgot his wallet. 

&amp;#x200b;

now i have had people forget to bring money before. and i'm usually very understanding about it. what i'll usually do is hang onto something of theirs as collateral (usually a driver's license, sometimes their car keys or phone). i put it in the lockbox and wait for them to go home and grab their wallets. pretty much everyone who owns a boat on this lake also lives on/near the lake, so it's never been an issue. something that i also did that i didn't tell the customers that i was doing was writing down their boat's tag number. if they didn't pay by the end of the day, i could give the tag number to security and the could pull up their boat registration, which had their name, address, the works. up to this day i had never had to report a customer to security. 

&amp;#x200b;

when mr. mm states that he doesn't have his wallet, i quickly glance at the tag on the side of his boat and jot down the numbers. i then address mr. mm.

&amp;#x200b;

me: well sir, it's the end of the day, so if you could hurry home and get your wallet asap i would appreciate it. i'll also need something of yours to keep as collateral. 

mr. mm: oh that'll take too long. do you have a phone on you?

me: yeah, in my purse

mr. mm: if you could give me your phone i can call my wife, she can drive down here with my wallet in no time.

&amp;#x200b;

this answer satisfies me, so i turn to go into the building and grab my phone. while i'm doing this, i hear him turn his engine on. not too unusual, so i keep going on my way. then i hear a massive vroooom followed by a loud crunch. i whip around and see this guy speeding down the lake. he had pulled a runner on me. but because this man is apparently an idiot he also forgot to untie his boat from the dock completely. he got the rope off the cleat next to him but had apparently forgotten about the one tied to the back of his boat, which i had left some slack on. now, normally the cleats on the boat would lose in this situation, or maybe the rope would snap, but our dock was a super old, crappy, splintery mess. so instead the cleat that was nailed into the dock got pulled completely free, along with an enormous chunk of wood. there was also a huge crack running down the length of the plank. this dumbass was now speeding down the lake with a piece of the dock dragging behind him. 

&amp;#x200b;

there's not really much i can do about mr. mm now, so i go inside and radio security. i give them the tag number, along with a description of him and his boat. i also mention that he damaged the dock and owes almost $200 in gas. they thank me and say they'll get right on it. i then text my boss what happened and sent him a picture of the freshly ruined dock. he is pissed and says mr. mm better be prepared to fix it. i then go inside and finish closing for the day. i had to include a note to finance about why we were almost $200 short for the day and explained that security was working on it. 

&amp;#x200b;

the very next day my boss calls me. security had gotten the police involved for theft and destruction of private property (the dock technically belonged to the neighborhood association). they got to him that very same day because of course they did, they had his address. also, turns out the guy wasn't even married. he just told me that bs to get me to turn my back. the association threatened to press charges and bring the guy to court unless he agreed to the following terms:

&amp;#x200b;

1) he would pay what he owed for the gas

2) he would be banned from registering a boat on this lake (it was either for 10 or 15 years, i can't really remember)

3) he would pay to completely replace the dock he damaged

&amp;#x200b;

mr. mm, apparently belonging to the ""throw money at problems to make them go away"" school of thought, or perhaps just realizing that if it went to court he would probably lose (the whole thing was caught on the security cameras), agreed to the terms without much of a fight. the marina was closed for 3 weeks while the dock was being rebuilt. i returned to work after that to admire our brand-spanking-new dock. the new dock's planks were composite instead of wood, and we got brand new pilings too. no more splinters! the new dock cost the guy nearly $8,000 dollars. to this day, i don't understand why a guy with so much money to throw around got so agitated about paying $200 for gas for a boat that must have cost him well over $60,000. 

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: guys tries to run after refusing to pay his $200 gas bill, damages dock, has to pay $8,000 for a new one.

347,can opener meltdown,"so, i worked at an actual dollar store, where everything was $1 usd or less. this was a good 5+ years ago, so my memory is a little fuzzy. during my tenure, i got to see some interesting customers while. i didn’t know about this subreddit until voiceyhere put up an episode.

on one of the walls of my particular dollar store we have kitchen gadgets. nothing too fancy, whisks, silverware, ice cube trays, you get the picture. this asshole customer (ac) had previously bought a can opener. one of the minimalist ones that isn’t exactly sturdy.

ac comes barging in on a particularly busy day, myself and the other cashier (c) both have long lines down our registers. ac starts shouting and complaining to c about how said can opener broke on him, while the gear-key assembly basically popped apart. a simple spot-weld would’ve been an easy fix, provided it didn’t make the aluminum brittle or melt.

c: “i’m sorry sir, but if you would like to pick another item, we can happily exchange it out.” (inventory was basically nonexistent for this company)
ac: (boiling with entitlement) “no! i want my money back!!” (this dumbass asked for a $1.08 refund (including sales tax) which burned more gas getting to the store.)
c: “i’m sorry, but our company policy does not allow us to refund purchases.”
ac: (turning to the line down c’s register) “be careful what you buy here guys.”
i heard everyone in the store aside ac preform an internalized facepalm


i wish i could say that this story has an ending of “he just gave up and walked out”, but alas, it does not. the store manager ended up refunding him the money, to which he quipped “was that so hard?”
customers who witness the whole thing shared their thoughts between myself and c, mostly how he spent more money in gas than here, how stupid his comment was, et cetera.",Hammer_Unto_Dawn,tfr
348,"customer tries to get a free phone repair, but ends up looking like an idiot instead","technically my coworker’s story, but sharing it for him. i’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. 

so i work for a company that repairs cell phones, and we have a very reasonable price for replacing screens that have been broken (think well under $50). if there’s no physical damage present, then failing parts are replaced for free. pretty nice and customers are usually pretty happy with this.

lady walks in, nose in the air, and asks how long it would take to repair her phone, because the lcd is no longer responsive. coworker takes the phone and sure enough, there’s a few cracks here and there and lines going through the screen. cw = coworker, l = lady. 

cw: ah, yeah i definitely see where the phone may be having issues! we could certainly fix this for you, but because of the cracks in the screen, it would be the [small repair fee]...

l: *in a suuuuper whiny, pretentious voice* no. it won’t. because i’ve brought it here to be repaired before and [company] waived the fee! i’ve been a customer just soooooo loooonnnggg!

cw: ah... okay... well unfortunately i don’t have a way to do that for you in my syst—

l: *cuts him off* do you have the parts?

cw: uh, yes, i should have those in sto—

l: *cuts him off again* no. do you have them. yes or no??

cw: *turns to look in our parts drawer and ignoring the sass* let me look for you ma’am! 

l: yeah, i’m not paying for it. i didn’t have to before and i won’t now. i’ll call them. i’ll call [company] because i know they’ll waive it for me! i know they will! 

cw: *walks back from checking our parts* yep, so i do have those parts, i could do that repair for you today if you’d like...

l: *already holding her phone up to her ear, and acting like she somehow magically is connected within seconds to whomever she thinks waives these type of things. she looks at my coworker super annoyed like he’s interrupting her* no. you’re not going to touch it until i have a chance to tell them what’s happening. because i knoowww they’re going to waive it for me!

cw: okay ma’am... no problem... just let me know what they say...

at this point, l walks over and sits in one of our waiting chairs near our work station, and proceeds to “talk to someone” on the phone... she makes a big show of saying and spelling her last name, rummaging through her purse, and overall making a scene about being on the phone with some kind of customer service. 

what she didn’t realize, was that we could plainly see her screen from where we were sitting, and she was most definitely not on the phone with anyone... not only that, but she kept accidentally turning on her phone’s flashlight (not typically an issue when you’re actually on a call..) and she had an actual phone call come through (phone started audibly ringing) while she was pretending to be speaking to someone. of course she makes this big show of “oh! oh i’m going to have to put you on hold!” while she randomly presses on her screen... 

l: *after literally being “on the phone” for maybe 3 minutes* okayy! they’ve waived it! 

no, lady. no they have not. 

edit to add the ending:
unfortunately we didn’t get to embarrass her as much as i would have loved to!

she went through all those theatrics and all this sass, only to tell us she didn’t even have time to do the repair today (would take about an hour) because she had to go out of town. she ended up telling us she would just go to our company’s location in the city, and that she fully expected them to honor the “waiver”. 

fun fact, we know the repair techs in the city, and they will not put up with her bs. i only wish i could see how royally they’re going to put her in her place when she tries to pull the same crap. ",NeurologicalNonsense,tfr
349,"i don't think you know what ""breaking a 100"" means, lady","fuel clerk

a woman came and asked me to break her 100 bill. i'd just started my shift and we only have a set 400$ with a certain amount of 10s and 5s, so until we get a handful of 20s, we can't break 100s. we also don't have access to a safe with cash in it, since we're part of a grocery store and the only safe we have contains a second drawer from the previous clerk's shift that has the 400$ in it, which obviously we can't take the 10s or 5s from because the next clerk to come in wouldn't have change to give out either. 

lady: can you give me change for this 100?

me: no, i'm sorry but i just put this drawer in and i don't have enough bills. 

lady: ...you don't have at least 100$ in there? 

me: i mean...yeh, but if i take the 100 then i won't have enough bills to make change for customers. 

lady: that doesn't make any sense.

350,what do you mean ice cream melts?,"i work in an ice cream shop and bakery. we do pick up catering and our most popular option for this is our sundae bar package. it includes home made ice creams plus toppings, bowls, scoopers, and spoons.

&amp;#x200b;

sc: can i pick it up at 3 o'clock at your location in (other town 30 minutes away)

me: oh, if you want to pick it up there you will need to order from them because that location has a different owner. 

sc:well i am already here i don't want to drive over there to order.

me:okay, well since i have written up your order already i can give you their number and you could easily place the order over the phone.

sc: no no, it's fine it's just a little bit closer to my house. i can pick it up here.

so, i assume she means she lives in between the stores and finish up the transaction. 

me:alright here is your receipt, we will see you for pickup. you may want to bring a cooler if you are driving more than 15 minutes away, since it is is going to be very hot all week. they sell the styrofoam ones next store.

she comes to pick up the order without a cooler, i grab her order from the deep freeze and wish her well.

an hour later i get a phone call from sc screaming.

me: hello, thank you for calling (store name) how may i help you?

sc: all the ice cream in my catering package is completely melted!

me: is this sc?

sc: yes! you sold me melted ice cream!

me: ma'am that ice cream was left in a -15 degree freezer all night you picked it up an hour ago did you put it in the freezer when you got home?

sc: i just got home! it didn't even make it home! i need a refund and you should bring me new ice cream immediately!

me: so the ice cream sat in your car for an hour without a cooler? 

sc: yes! i had to get it home for my party!

me: ma'am i'm sorry, i can't help you. it's 95 degrees outside, i suggested you bring a cooler, i suggested you order from a nearer location. you ignored both suggestions. all i can suggest now is that you re-freeze the ice cream.

she yelled at me some more and then sent the owner a complaint. the owner had to stop himself from laughing at her when he called her back. he just told her ""ma'am, ice cream melts. once it leaves our store it's your responsibility to keep it cold or get it in a freezer in a timely manner.""

me: sir, where are these items from?

c: i took it from there.

i followed him and looked there. he opened a bundle of 9 items to buy the amount he needs, which is 2. the bundle must be sold as a bundle.

me: i'm sorry to say this, but you should buy this whole bundle.

c: what? i can't afford this!


by the way, that bundle was like $3.6.


me: but you broke the packaging.

c: it's not my fault. you should state like 'do not open the packaging!'

me: sorry, we couldn't state that for every single item. and as long for my experience, no one opened the packaging.

c: you could sell this bundle to other customers.

me: no one would buy unsealed items.

c: break the packaging and must buy the whole bundle? where is that law stated? i am a regular customer here!

maybe it will end up my boss purchase the whole bundle, and hand him 2 items for free. because 'the customer is always right'. darn retail life...

354,we don’t have a customer bathroom,"i have some weird stories from the ice cream place i used to work at, if people are interested i’ll post more but most of them are rather short.

a little context : in my state(probably the rest of the usa too but don’t quote me on that) it’s against the law to let customers be anywhere near food prep and as such no customer may use our bathroom as they’d have to go through the back of house area.

also when you walk into the store there’s the customer area and towards the rear of the shop there are two doors, one is a supply closet, and the other is to get to the back area.

my manger is bengali and the woman might be as well or at the very least fluent in the language. 

and finally, my boss is cool with us letting close friends or family using the bathroom as long as there are no customers in the store , but customers themselves are a strict no-no. this is also the extent of how “cool” my boss is and given that i’ve been written up twice before this incident i was trying to be on my best behavior.

so here are the people in the story 

bl: bathroom lady

me: yours truly

cm: cool manager 


i’m doing my usual thing just standing behind the counter looking for something to do kinda zoned out, as bl walks in

cm: hi welcome to [store] what can i do for you today?

bl: hi cm (i guess she looked at his name tag) and the proceeds to say something in bengali in a questioning tone 

cm: continues the conversation in bengali, then turns to me, i’m gonna go to the basement to get the syrup she wants for her shake, can you get it started?

me: yeah sure 

so he goes to the basement, and bl turns to me.

bl: i need to use the bathroom

me: sorry but we don’t have a bathroom you can use.

bl: i’m going to use the bathroom cm said it was okay, i know him and i’ve used it before 

me: uh i don’t really know you. do you mind waiting til he gets back upstairs ?

bl: no! i have to go ! i know where it is i’m going now!

me: uh ok [cries in minimum wage] 

bl proceeds to walk towards the rear of the shop, looks at both doors, and opens the door to the supply closet, closes it, and looks at me with a blank face.

me: i told you we didn’t have a bathroom you could use. 

at this point the manager is came back upstairs and just sees her closing the supply closet door. 

cm looks at her and says

cm: hey what’re you doing?

i butt in

me: she said you guys knew each other and that she was heading to our bathroom

cm: no, just met her, just now

bl at this point is red faced and walks out.

me and cm start laughing 


tldr: lady pretended to be friends with manager to use bathroom, i wait to make sure it’s ok, she walks up to a supply closet, then walks out.

355,customer calls me rude when she couldn’t show me proof,"background: i work as a receptionist at a nail salon in a “higher end” area of the city i live in. the salon is privately owned by a family and there are two other locations. the location i worked in happened to be the biggest one and we offered more services than the other two locations. 


so a week prior, i booked an appointment for a party of five (po5) ladies who wanted to come in and get their nails done. each guest wanted to get different services and the lady booking the appointment, we’ll call her person 1 (p1) said one of the guests wanted a hot stone massage. we offer a few different massages and each massage had different time options. the only time options for the hot stone was 50 minutes or 80 minutes. when i asked p1 which option she wanted to book, she asked for the price for each time and i told her $95 for 50 minutes and $125 for 80 minutes. in her exact words she says “hmm, put her down for 50 minutes.”

before hanging up the phone with any customer, i always make sure to confirm one last time the date, time of the appointment and each service they will be getting. p1 approved everything and they were set. my salon does confirmation calls the day before and i was the one to call their party. it goes to voicemail and i leave a message going over each service, time, date, etc. they never called back or anything (which happens). 

the day of their appointment, the po5 come in and gave my coworkers and i attitude from the start. one of my coworkers was the one that checked them in and talked to them. all is fine for now until the girl (p2) finishes her massage and comes out. my coworker overhears p2 saying how she received a 50 minute massage when she asked for 30 minutes. 

i get the feeling that they’re going to say something about it to us eventually so i double check all of our menus. we have printed menus for customers to take, on display at the front desk as well as menus/prices on our website for each location. all of our locations offer nail services and waxing, but the location i work at is the only one that also offers facials and full body massages. the menu we have online is the exact same as the one we have for customers to take in the store. 

each guest pays separately and when p2 comes up, as i predicted, she starts going off about how she got a 50 minute massage when she only wanted 30 minutes. she said when she checked in she told us that she only wanted 30 min and even told the masseuse that as well. she tells us that we need to be more clear when booking appointments and that she wanted the shortest option for the massage. i told her i was the one that booked their appointments and that the massage she specifically asked for (the hot stone) massage only came with a 50 or 80 minute option. i repeated the exact conversation between me and p1 when i booked their appointment and no where did i mention anything about 30 minutes. i also told her i gave them a confirmation call the day prior, and went over in detail each service they were all getting but no one had called back to confirm or correct their appointment. i even showed her our menu on display. 

p2 then said she told my coworker when she checked in that she only wanted 30 minutes (my coworker said no one mentioned that at all) and that they were looking at a menu online that apparently said 30 minutes was an option for the hot stone massage. i asked her to show me the menu she happened to see and she searched through her phone for about 20 seconds before giving up and started to walk away. 

as she was walking away i asked again if she had a photo and that’s when p2’s mom (who was getting her nails done at the station right next to where i was standing) cuts in and says, “i don’t appreciate how rude you’re being. that is my daughter and i don’t like that you’re speaking to her like that. she is a minor, she is only 17,  you can’t be rude to a minor.”

i wasn’t speaking to them rudely at all. this po5 had been rude to my coworkers and i the second they came in. they all had a frown on their faces and they were also giving attitude to the nail techs that were working on them as well. 

i just find it funny that p2 couldn’t show me any proof of this menu that apparently said we had a 30 minute hot stone massage and when asked if she had a picture, her mom was so quick to jump in and call me rude to change the subject. nice try. 

they asked for my name but the jokes on them as that was my last day working as i’m going on vacation to japan! ",pinkbambina,tfr
356,customer tries to get a little something extra in his game purchase,"first off a thank you to voiceyhere and fresh for doing videos and letting me know about this sub.  


some backstory: i’m an assistant store manager at a video game store. this dad and son came in, and with a smile on my face, i ask them how they’re doing and if i can help them find anything:  


me - obvious  
d - dad, i wanna say late-30s to early-40s  
s - son, about 11  


&gt;d: “i wouldn’t know what we’re looking for, he’s the one who ones to buy a game!” the dad gestures toward his son, who is now scouring the xbox one section of our store.  

&gt;me: “what can i help you find, man?” i ask, bending down a little so i’m at eye level with the kid.  

&gt;s: “yeah! i’m looking for rainbow 6: siege!!”  

now i absolutely love that game, my coworkers know it, my regulars know it, so i immediately start talking to him about it.  

&gt;me: “oh! that’s actually my favorite game! how did you find out about it?”  

&gt;s: “some of my favorite youtubers play it! and i really want to play it with my neighbor!”  

&gt;me: “that’s awesome!” i exclaim as i help him find the used case for the game. “here you go!”  

i then stand up straight and turn toward the dad, who was just watching us this entire time.  

&gt;me: “sir, just so you know, this game is rated m for mature because of intense violence and language, are you sure that’s okay for him?”  

&gt;d: “yeah, that’s perfectly fine.”  

so we go up to the register and i start ringing them up, the price of the game came out to be $37.99 on the label (comes out to $34.19 or something with our membership, relevant later), and the dad asked:  
&gt;“and this is the year 2 gold edition (from here on referred to as y2ge), right? because it says it is right here” as he points to the case.  

&gt;me: “sadly no, it doesn’t come with the y2ge content because it’s preowned and doesn’t come with the code that has the content. it’s just the base game.” i point out on the sticker that it does not say it is the y2ge.  

&gt;d: “well it’s labeled as the gold edition, how can i get that?”  

&gt;me: “you would have to purchase it new to ensure you get the content, but it doesn’t look like we have a copy and it doesn’t seem to be available online. it is, however, only a little more expensive at $44.97.”  

&gt;d: “the case says that it’s the y2ge, so are you guys gonna give me what’s promised on the box?”  

&gt;me: “sorry sir, we have no way to do that. we can’t print new codes for the content that comes with the game, nor do we have any copies to sell you. preowned games may not come with all the content listed on the packaging because it’s preowned.”  

&gt;d, turning to his son: “is this what you want, son?”  

&gt;s, now just rocking back and forth in anticipation: “yes”  

&gt;d: “are you sure?”  

s nods his head.  

so he pays for the game, grumbling, and we finish up the transaction. on his way out the door, d yells:  
&gt;“you shouldn’t be false advertising prices for games!!”  

i stand there just absolutely devastated and embarrassed. not just because of what he yelled, but because i want everybody buying that game in specific to enjoy their experience at the store so they come back and tell me how it’s going for them.  

now eventually, i forget about it, but a couple weeks later, my coworker asks me about a 1-star review that was left on our store’s google reviews that reads word for word:  

“i used to frequent this store. went to buy a copy of rainbow six siege gold edition for xbox one. the label said $35. [evl21] pulled the regular edition from behind the counter. when i pointed it out, he said the gold edition was $10 more. [evl21] would not honor the price as marked. in the future, i'll go where prices are labeled accurately; not where they lack the integrity to sell items as marked.”  

i was beyond pissed at that point, and i’m glad i’ve never seen him again.  

tl;dr - guy tried to buy a special edition of a game for his son preowned, i explain that it doesn’t come with the special content because it’s preowned, guy writes bad review about how our store lacks integrity to sell items as marked.",EVL21,tfr
357,that... isn't where that is kept. at all.,"i am a kitchen and bath designer in a big box retail store. what i lose in creative autonomy i make up with good benefits and pay stability. right now, it's worth the payoff. 

if you've never been to a kitchen design center in a big box store (or even a private design studio), there are sample doors everywhere that show different door styles and colors from the different cabinets manufacturers. said doors have a ""linear foot price"" on the back of them; it's an average price based on a super basic 10x10 foot kitchen with super simple cabinets. it's used as an industry-standard comparative tool to figure out if the cabinet you like is super expensive or not. 

this guy comes into my showroom. i ask him what his project was working on and he said he was just looking. which, honestly, is fine- some people just like looking and imagining. so, i do my ""if you have any questions, please ask"" thing and go back to my computer and keep working on the design i'm doing.

about 5 minutes later, he starts shuffling through my wall-o-sample doors. about a minute after that, i hear him doing the annoyed sigh thing. which is... odd in my neck of the woods. so, i get up again and ask if he had any questions about the samples or if he was looking for anything in particular. he said thanks but was still just looking.

... k. so, instead of going back to my computer, i start cleaning the showroom and kind of hang around where he is. sometimes, people get overwhelmed by the process of remodeling a space and don't know how to articulate their questions. he wouldn't be the first and won't be the last. it's why i am here.

i watch him go back to the sample doors, look behind one sample door, get a tiny bit frustrated, and move on to another door. he keeps repeating this for a few doors until he's getting visably frustrated at whatever he's seeing. so, i approach him again thinking he may be frustrated with the pricing on the doors. 

me: ""sir, i can see you're getting frustrated. i'm not trying to sell you anything- i just want to help you find what you're looking for. is there a cabinet in your home that you're trying to match?""

him: *sighs loudly and looks through another couple of sample doors like they killed his dog*

me: ""sir.""

him: ""i... i just don't understand where you people keep your sinks!""

me: *internal windows blue screen.*

*reboots*

""... wat.""

him: ""i need a kitchen sink."" 

me: ""um, {location in store}. would you like me to show you?""

him: ""no."" *stomps away*

y'all. it's been a year since this happened and i am still baffled. what the hell kind of time lord technology did he think i had behind each sample door? why would anyone think saleable product is behind a sample of an unrelated product? why am i even surprised by any of this? customers are weird.

358,paper or plastic?,"my first job when i was in high school was as a cashier at a local supermarket, part time for minimum wage.

it was the late 80's and this store still had manual registers so we had to ring every purchase up by hand. some days were crazy with long lines, full shopping carts and angry customers. it didn't help that this store charged for every bag, 3 cents for paper, 10 cents for plastic. the plastic bags were sturdy extra large bags, the paper bags were pretty big and were doubled so they were pretty sturdy as well and were definitely reusable. there were bright neon banners in the front of the store stating that you had to **pay for**, or **bring your own bags**, and that you had to **bag your own groceries.** all bags were kept under the counters so you had to ask a cashier for one. when i first started working there i still had faith in the human race so naturally i assumed that people would observe the bright banners that were right in front of their faces and using common sense, act accordingly, i thought if they didn't ask for bags that they were one of the customer that brought their own (as many repeat customers did) but some customers would wait until i had finished their order and then just look at me. so this exchange happened often during my first few days.

customer: can i get some bags?!

me: paper or plastic

c: paper

me: how many?

c: i don't know x i guess

me: that'll be x cents

c: i have to pay for bags?!

i point to the neon colored banner with bold back lettering.

c: that's ridiculous!

hands me change

c: i'm never coming back here again! (*they always came back, it was one of only two markets in the area, it had the cheapest prices and larger selection of items)*

they stand there still looking at me a little more annoyed now.

c: aren't you going to bag my stuff?

again i point to the neon banners. to be honest if they were polite about it i would help them since i can't start ringing up the next customer till this one gets all their groceries off my area, but if they were rude i just pointed to the sign. after the first week i started asking at the beginning of the order if they were going to need bags and i would sometimes get looks like i was stupid for asking.

m: will you be needing bags?

c: of course i need bags

me: paper or plastic

c: paper

me: how many?

c: i don't know x i guess

i ring up the bags.

c: what did you just ring up?

me: your bags

c: you're charging me for bags?!

i point to the sign.

i wasn't a total bitch, it was store policy and there was always a front end person walking the registers mostly to handle returns and that sort of thing but also to make sure we charged for bags. sometimes if they were out of sight i would slip some customers an extra bag or two if they were nice. but attitude got you nowhere with me.

359,lighting,"i am working at the game shop, but we also print, scan, fax and make copies of documents. but this shop is in lithuania so we speak lithuanian instead of english. we usually call those services almost exactly the same as in english, but there is another word for those, it is 'atsišviesti' it would sound something like lighting(getting document through light) and that word means all of those services.

so some people ask for printing, or fax, or scanning. but some! they come and ask for lighting, how should we know which of those 5 services do the want? when you ask them which one by naming all of them, they repeat lighting and get angry for some wierd reason. and we had this women... 

me: hello, how can i help you? 

she:hello, i would like to use your lighting services. 

me:ok, we can do that, but do you want to print, scan, fax, copy documents? 

she: i want to 'light' them. 

me: do you want to use a computer? (because people mostly print from a pc at our store) 

she: yes! 

then imagine.. she walks to a pc, pulls out her papers. starts looking around, and gets frustrated. 

she: how do i light them? what should i do know? 

me:(now i understand she might want to copy them or scan or.. fax them.. well fuck) so.. do you want to make duplicates of them? 

she: no! i want to send these to my lawyer! is it that hard to understand what i want to do, i told you like 3 times!

me: ok, come over here, i will fax them. but you said you need lighting.. a man came here 10 minutes ago, asked for lighting and he printed from a pc..  other made copies, how should i know? 

we have to face this atleast couple of times a day..  a person who invented this word in our language should be hanged. as i always want to punch those clients into face for using that dumb word!

360,he broke his item in the parking lot and tried to leave with a new one,"one of our regular, somewhat rude, customers came in today and i of course had the pleasure of dealing with him. some days he's decent or sweet, some days not. however i honestly can't remember what he *exactly* did the first time around to come off as rude, most likely his tone or demands of putting his items in bags as if i wouldn't in the first place.

anyhow, this man comes through my line, rude as usual, buying a 2 liter of root beer and something to eat. i check him out, he leaves, normal transaction. less than 2 minutes later said man comes in and sets his 2 liter, still in its bag, on top of my bagging carousel, *obviously* leaking/spraying.

man: ""i'm going to get a new one and switch these out.""

me slightly dumbstruck, ""wait.. did you drop it outside?""

man: ""yep.""

still stunned i can't help make my new customer wait a few seconds before the man reappeared. 

man: ""i don't want this one anymore, i dropped it, i'm just going to take this one.""

trying to be nice and maybe knock some sense into him i said, ""sir.. i don't think you can do that.""

man: ""what do you mean i can't?""

me: ""you dropped it in the parking lot after you already bought it, i *really don't* think you can that.""

man: ""you think? what do you mean you think? which is it?""

me, again trying to be nice: ""you can't.. but i'll ask a manager for you.""

the man follows behind me as i ask my supervisor, who gives a blunter 'no that's not how that works' answer as well. 

man: ""*fine*, i'll buy *this one* *and* take the first one.""

361,"""oh, you´re going to charge me for this cake""","so, this didn´t happen to me, but to a co-worker.  (i´m sorry for the gammar, english is not my first language)

i work at a cake shop and even tho the normally we would be 2 girls on each shift, sometimes we had to cover the shift alone. 

anyway, my co-worker (cw) was covering the afternoon shift alone that day.  at the time we were allowed to have something like 80 dollars in the register (1500 mexican pesos). no more, for in the case of a theft, we wouldn´t lose more. and, we used to take dollars at a very high price, even more than the banks (this is important)

so, cw is working the shift, and then a customer enters the store, looking messy and distracted. cw greets him and asks if he was looking for a flavor in special.  (messy costumer is mc)

mc: *no, just. which cake is good?*

he says that in a rushed and rude way, but even when cw is kinda confused, she goes on to tell him the cakes that she has at the moment and gets interrupted by mc. 

mc: *i don´t care, just give me this cake.* he says pointing to the fridge where we store the cakes. 

cw: *the.. fruit cake?* 

mc: *yeah, whatever.* 

cw just shrugs it off, takes the cake off the fridge and puts it on the counter, then rings the cake up. 

cw: *that would be 350 pesos* (about 18 or 19 dollars) 

he does not say anything,  just throws a 100 dollar bill on the counter. cw is very confused and points to mc that she doesn´t have enough change for that bill and asks if he has a smaller bill or maybe mexican pesos. 

he says no. 

cw says that in that case, she can´t charge the cake, and so, mc can´t have the cake, because she would still owe him even after giving him the whole content of the register as change. he just looks at her, mad, for a minute. 

mc: *oh, you´re gonna charge me for that cake.* he then opens the dome of the cake and just fucking smashes his whole hand in the cake. he even smears the cake on the counter while having a smug grin on his face. 

cw is livid, that wasn´t the first time a customer entered the store trying to get some change, but that was a whole new level. she didn´t know if she had to call the police or who. finally, she calls the central office and tells the manager what happened. they ask her if she has enough money on her to cover the rest of the change if she takes the bill until the manager can come and get her more change and her money back. she says yes so she takes the 100 dollars and hands mc the change. he gets out of the store laughing and just throws the cake on the street. the manager got there 15 minutes after that. 

&amp;#x200b;

needless to say, after that night, she resigned and we got to have on the register at least 100 dollars. ",Nhymue,tfr
362,my trip to dyslexic hell,"so i used to be a cashier at a large retailer, referred to as paulmart for the sake of the story. my paulmart was one of the small ones, a neighborhood market, and while we did well enough, it wasn't uncommon for things to break due to poor maintenance, the registers for example. so there i am one day just minding my own buisness, ringing up customers like i normally do, having a good conversation, when all of a sudden the scanner stops working. no problem, i'll just use the hand gun....except that wasn't working either. so i called a csm over figuring they would do the sane thing and suspend the transaction and move it to another register. except she doesn't. she looks at the belt and tells me ""well. they don't have many items left (about 20), so why don't just hand key in the rest and then move to another register?"". little bit of backstory, i'm dyslexic, and the csm knew this. i reminded her and she shrugs it off and says ""you can handle it, i know you can"" and walks off. i take it with a good sense of humor and look at my now giggling customers and say ""hell. i am now in dyslexic hell"" jokingly. they laugh and we spend the next 15 minutes (normally would take me less than 2) laughing and finishing the transaction. at least i got a cute story out of it.",Hallow96,tfr
363,i messed up. and i hope no one says anything about it,"sorry i’m on my phone! tldr at the bottom! 

today was a little bit of a busier sunday than normal and i was scheduled alone. things slowed down for a quite a while and a girl came up wanting to a do a simple return. no problem. had her receipt and the card she used to pay and all the tags were in place. solid easy return. 

halfway through she starts telling me that she’s been all over the place today and ranting about everything that’s gone wrong- she is visibly frazzled and having a hard time with everything she’s holding. i scan her return (a fitness watch band) and stop her rant to ask if the other item she’s placed on my counter (a phone case- same brand as the band) is on a separate purchase thinking she’s also returning the case. 
she corrects me and tells me it’s hers her phone is getting fixed so she’s just carrying around her case. i apologize and set the case back down on a different receipt she had with her. 

i finish her return and her return receipt and a tag stating this band as a specialty item (tech- our store doesn’t typically carry tech or tech gear)  pop out of my printer. like i said before she was fumbling with a lot in her hands so i reach out to grab the empty package box which is trash now to dispose of it for her and exchange the box for her return receipt which i’ve stapled to her original. i let her know i hope her day turns around and hurry her off because there’s now a line of 5 behind her! i quickly start my next transaction and realize after i greet this new customer i should take a second to tack the specialty slip onto the band... and don’t see the band. anywhere. 

i get through my line and look around my register and the watch band is no where to be found. no one else has been behind my register. i go through everything else my last few customers have returned in case it ended up under some clothes and nope. nowhere. 

i realize i must have given her the band back with her receipt. 

i call a manager and tell her the story and ask if we can just go in and void the transaction but we don’t want the customer to come back realizing she still has it and just drop it off expecting her return to still go through so she’s going to double check with our security so they can check the cameras and make sure it’s not at my register somewhere. 
security checks the cameras..... and yep. exactly what i thought i did is exactly what happened. i feel so embarrassed that i’ve been working here for 5 years and let this happen. 

security asked me to walk him through the transaction and asked if i wanted to see what i did. i didn’t. i know exactly what happened because i can picture me doing it. he said it’s alright and we did go ahead and void that transaction before we closed but now i’m scared i’ll be hearing from the security manager. this was a big mess up and even though we were able to void the transaction and i caught my slip up it still happened. 

the most stressful day at my job curtesy of a wrist band. 

tldr; i accidentally gave a customer back an item she returned along with her money back. i realized and fixed it as best as i could but now i’m probably in trouble. ",melhernp,tfr

366,guy tries claiming warranty on an item he lost,"so i work at an electronics store and a couple weeks ago, a man came in store to buy a replacement remote for his tv. purchase goes well and he walks out a happy customer.

fast forward to today, i get paged to the front counter by our admin and i see the guy with an annoyed look on his face and the admin holding his receipt looking puzzled. she pulls me aside and whispers so the guy can't hear her.

admin: ""so this guy bought a replacement remote off you a while back and wants a new one.""

me: ""did he say what's wrong with it?""

admin: ""he says he lost his remote and since it comes with one year warranty, we need to give him a new one....""

i ask her if she's being serious and she nods and looks at me with a blank face that shows just how much of her soul has been sucked out of her from dealing with idiots like this on a daily basis. so i put on my customer service smile and walk over to him.

me: ""hi admin just told that you want a new remote?""

customer: ""yes i lost my remote and it comes with one year warranty so you need to give me a new one now.""

me: ""i'm sorry but manufacturers warranty only covers faults with the unit and not physical damage, loss or theft.""

customer: ""i know exactly what warranty covers and under consumer law you have to give me a new one now!""

couple people turn around since he yelled. now usually when a customer raises their voice we're told to get our manager or 2ic who will deal with them and let us serve someone else. problem was it was the manager's day off and 2ic was on lunch. so it fell to me to spend 20 minutes explaining that warranty is not insurance and that i can't give him a new remote for free. he has that entitled look on his face and starts yelling again about how incompetent i am and that he's been shopping at our branch for 20 years (our branch opened in 2008). now somebody had told our 2ic in the lunch room what was going on and he quickly walks up and asks me what's going on. i then explain the story trying really hard not to laugh and keep a straight face when saying it. with the same blank face our admin had, he walks up to the guy tells him the same thing i had spent 20 minutes trying to explain. the guy starts swearing at the top of his voice and throwing a tantrum that my 3 year old niece wouldn't even do. 2ic calmly tells him to get the fuck out of the store (in those exact words). this shocks him and he calms down a bit. 

customer: i'm not leaving until i get a replacement remote.

2ic: i don't care gtfo.

customer: but i'm here to do business with you!

2ic: the minute you started swearing at my staff you lost my business now gtfo.

customer: but-

2ic: gtfo

he finally gets the hint and storms out. 2ic tells me next time a customer raises his voice against me, i'm to get him regardless as to whether he is having lunch as he won't have any of his staff treated like that. 

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: moron buys remote for tv. loses it. tries to get a new one under warranty. doesn't understand warranty will not cover losing the item. yells and swears and gets kicked out.

367,man wants to return a lightbulb,"so, a few years back i used to work in a middlesized retail store. often worked behind the registers, and customers who wanted to return items had to do so at the registers.
there was a policy on returning but management didn't really care. they wanted everything to make the customers happy, we even had to take back worn underwear but that's a whole other story.

one day, a man comes in the store, walks up to my register and this is how it goes. sorry i'm on mobile so formatting might be off.

me: hello, welcome to *store*! how can i help you? (he hadn't put items on the belt)
customer (c): hi, i would like to return this lightbulb. it has stopped working.
me: oh, shame to hear! we usually don't take lightbulbs back but i will see what i can do. do you have a receipt?
c: yes, right here.

and i kid you not, this man gives me a receipt with solely the purchase of the lightbulb, from six years ago.
i was dumbfounded by the determination of not only keeping that receipt for six years, but even then still coming in the store and wanting a refund on a 6 year old lightbulb.

me: sorry sir, even if we took lightbulbs back, this receipt is six years old and thats way outside our returntime.
c: but it's supposed to work for about 6000 times of flipping on and off. it says so on the box. do you really think i flipped it off and on in those six years? i can assure you i did not. now i would like a new one since it didn't hold up to its promise.

at this point i called my manager who explained to him that's not how it works and he didn't get a new bulb and at that point he angrily stormed away. i mean, props to the man for trying.

about two months later, working register again, this man comes back, friendly and all. i recognized him immediately and asked him what happened next. he had mailed the producer of the bulbs and they were so amused they sent him a couple free lightbulbs.

369,give me a refund... now. how about now? maybe now?,"this is from a few years ago so i don't remember what was said exactly but you'll get the picture. 

i work in a small charity shop, where i spend all my time on the cash register, as i have done since i joined, aged 14, when started for my dofe (basically extreme scouts for those that don't know what that is).

until about a year ago we didn't do refunds,  exchanges or credit notes. if you bought something, it was final, so everyone made sure to let customers know this - especially if they were uncertain - and to let them know we had a changing room if they wanted to try anything on, or that we could reserve it for a day or two if they were buying for someone else, for example. 

so, in my first few months there, a lady came in demanding a refund. i explained to her that we don't give refunds, gesturing to the ""no-refunds"" poster covering the entire wall behind me. she slammed a black dress - with a large stain on it and the tag removed, may i add - on the counter, saying no one had told her beforehand.

i apologised, insisting there was nothing i could do, and that was when she flipped. she proceeded to lean on the counter and scream in my face (a 14 y/o kid may i remind you) about how i was discriminating her and that my parents must be terrible people and that she hopes her kids don't turn out to be as ""vile as you"". she demanded to see the manager. i didn't tell her that there wasn't one in (as it was a sunday), i just called my sunday supervisor (who, in reality, basically was a manager...).

when my supervisor saw the woman, she sighed and reiterated the rules. when the customer argued she hadn't been told, my supervisor reassured her that she had in fact been told, because she was the person who sold her the dress. she then proceeded to tell the customer that, ""as you were told everyday for the last 5 days, we don't do refunds. now leave or we'll call the police."".

still to this day i can't get my head around the fact that she'd come in day after day after day and - as my supervisor told me - acted in the same way every time in the hope that someone would give her a refund, for a dress she'd clearly worn, even to the point of accusing a 14 yo of discrimination.

woman: well, you may just want to go over there and check the signs right now, and fix it.

i have no issue double checking if we have a sale going on that maybe the computer didn't automatically adjust the price for. but the tone the woman used with me was so demeaning and rude, i decided to really be petty.

372,i can't choose for you,"here's another tale from the full-serve gas station. it being winter in a seasonal summer vacation town, and it being the overnight shift, there's often long lulls between customers, and tonight was no exception. enter idiot customer, aka $ic, who rolls up in a beat-up sedan blasting music loud enough to rattle the kiosk i was sitting in. while annoying, he at least turned it off once i approached him.

&gt; **me:** hey, how's it going? what can i get you tonight?

&gt; **$ic:** give me $10 cash.

no return of my greeting, no ""may i have,"" no ""please."" he also said this in a subtly mocking way for whatever reason. okay then. also, he hasn't told me what type of gas he wants. we sell four grades of gasoline (plus diesel, though his was obviously a gasoline-driven car), and knowing the type of fuel is one of the three required pieces of information (the others being amount in dollars and method of payment) i needed before i started pumping.

&gt; **me:** sure. what type of gas?

&gt; **$ic:** regular, plus, premium, whatever.

again mocking, but more overt. before this customer, i had been by my lonesome for at least fifteen minutes, and i knew i had over an hour before the next rush (when a wave of employees of the big department store down the road got off shift), so i had no trouble messing back.

&gt; **me:** i'm sorry, sir, but you have to choose one.

&gt; **$ic:** you choose.

&gt; **me:** i can't do that, sir.

&gt; **$ic:** i don't care.

because of company policy, i could not choose for him. if i could, this would be a /r/maliciouscompliance story instead, and he'd be getting the most expensive gas we offered. and so i explained the policy.

&gt; **$ic:** fine, give me regular.

&gt; **me:** sure thing. just a heads up, you may need to pay inside, as i can only accept exact change after a certain time.

this is true, so as to prevent people from robbing the sole employee working outside. this fact also seems to overly annoy people. i can understand why, but it is policy. so i was expecting anger. instead he smiled and got even more mocking.

&gt; **$ic:** that's fine. i've got change. whatever you need. i've got lots of change.

comments like these continued until he'd gotten his $10 worth of gas. and then he handed me a $20 bill.

&gt; **me:** i'm sorry, sir, but as i said, i can only accept exact change. if you go inside and tell them you're paying pump [#], they'll get you your change.

374,i hate answering the phone.,"before i get into that, let me explain something.

our store isn't a big one, so our main phones are at the registers, where there should always be at least one person at all times. that means whoever is working the cash register is almost always the first person to answer the phone. our check out area is right in the front, that way we can greet every single customer that walks in.

now that i've established that, you can imagine that means we have a strict policy against what we call ""shopping by phone"". a customer can call and ask any questions they like but we can't put them on hold and ""go check in the back"" as we'd get asked on occasion. like today.

caller: hello, i'd like to know if you carry (something that would be in the kitchen section)?

me, having no idea for certain: i'm very sorry miss but we're not allowed to shop by phone.

caller, irritated: you can't just look for me real quick?!

me: our store is (store number, location), if you'd like to come in, we'd love to-

caller, getting angry: i know where the store is. i don't want to drive all the way there.

me: i'm so sorry miss, i'm not allowed to-

caller, fed up: well, that's how you lose sales. bye. (hangs up)

later that day as i headed to the break room for my lunch, i looked where the item would be if we had it. and sadly, it's against store policy to make personal call backs to customers and let them know whether or not we have what they're looking for. :)",Ringtailed-Loser,tfr
375,a sobering customer came in today.,"my store has issued a challenge to get to know our customers. 

today, i met a fantastic elderly woman. her name is patricia. she is 86 and needed some help finding some tissues.  

we got talking. she misses talking to people and having someone smiling at her and being friendly. we talked and talked for probably 20 minutes. she said she is ready to die. her kids don’t call; her grandkids don’t call, and she feels they’d be better off if she were gone. 

i told her that i don’t usually argue with customers, but she’s wrong. she is very much enjoyed and that she had brightened my day. 

in the end, i gave her my phone number and to call me any time. i hope she calls. i hope i see her again. i hope she doesn’t make a terrible choice and that she’s stronger than bad thoughts. 

i’m glad i took the time to get to know a customer today. ",I_SHIT_A_BRICK,tfr
376,well you get to pay more since you think you're that important,"fuel clerk. 

i've only been at work for an hour and i'm already done for the day. 

corporate called and asked me to drop our gas price to $2.19, a 30 cent drop. this is a very standard procedure but i'm always super careful doing it since a typo can cause huge issues. so i'm holding the phone and grabbing a sticky pad and a woman walks up to my window. (we work from inside a small glass kiosk with an intercom and a drawer, it's not a walk-in gas station.) 

i glance at her, we make eye contact, i smile and signal to her that i'll be with her in just one second as i'm jotting the new gas prices down and repeating it back. keep in mind, i can't speak to the woman because from the office area in the back, i'm probably 6 feet from the intercom button. 

this woman immediately opens the lid to the drawer, jams her money inside and slams it inside the kiosk. which isn't even how the drawer works, the drawer is designed to be controlled by the employee, you have to stick your hand inside and push it super awkwardly to push it to me from the outside. 

so i look over, see her standing there looking as dramatic as she could physically force herself to look and then i look back down at the desk to grab the pad and hang the phone up. keep in mind, my phone conversation consisted solely of them telling me the new fuel prices and reminding me to inform management. it took 30 seconds and she arrived after i'd picked up the phone. she got this flustered in less than 30 seconds. 

as soon as i look back down to hang the phone up and grab the sticky pad, she begins rapping the lid to the drawer up and down, which results in an obnoxious clattering racket since the lid is a sheet of acrylic plastic and the drawer is hollow metal. it's like nails on a chalkboard from inside the kiosk because it echoes. 

i was going to inform her that we just had a price drop and if she'd like to wait a moment, she'd pay less if she let me change the prices first. but instead she goes: ""that's really rude to stand there on the phone with a customer waiting"". i just told her i had to take it because it was corporate and rang her up. no cheaper gas for you. 

guy behind her got his gas cheaper and i hope she overheard me asking him if he'd like to wait a second while i changed the prices. ",SlytherinAhri,tfr
377,the saga of the chapstick,"once upon a time i worked at a convenience store in the downtown area of a rough and tumble east coast city. one day i came in and the person i was relieving immediately ran to the bathroom, leaving me alone. which was fine, i work six days a week alone, so this was no real issue. it wasn't how it was supposed to be, since that left me all alone to run both the cash register and the lottery, but it was what it was.

almost immediately after my coworker left a very angry woman came stomping in and started screaming at me about chapstick. for the last few days we had a display of regular chapstick in a bowl for $1 each on the counter at checkout, but the bowl was now gone, so i assumed we ran out as it was pretty low when i left the previous night. the woman who is screaming informs me that the mechanism that makes the chapstick come out of the tube does not work, and she wants a refund. 

here is the list of problems with that, it was clearly used, she had no receipt, and this chapstick was so generic she could have bought it from anywhere and i didn't remember selling it to her. plus, we were not the kind of place that did refunds. hell, my register didn't even have a button for that! the thing was old as hell and wonky and cobbled together from other registers. 

i informed her of these reasons and told her that if she informed the company via the information on the side of the chapstick, they would certainly send her a refund and probably some coupons and stuff too. big companies tend to be great like that. 

this was not what she wanted to hear!

she proceeds to go on a tirade about how i'm the wost thing that was ever born and she will get her $1 back, so help her god!!! i have been working in customer service enough to be completely unaffected by this, which is increasing her anger levels. 

just then, the store gets a rush and a bunch of people flood the place looking for cigarettes, snacks, drinks, and lottery, and of course they want it all now! i being to ignore her, because let's face it, i have other things to worry about and i've given her the information, her brain will just have to process that when it gets around to it. 

she gets even more angry now that i'm ignoring her and decides to call someone on the phone and rant at them in detail about the terrible things that have just happened to her. but i'm pretty sure no one was on the other end and it was just her trying to get the crowd of people to agree with her. spoilers, no one cared. 

so, seeing as how this was not working, she tries to attack me on a personal level. telling her ""phone friend"" that, and i will never forget this quote as long as i live ""just because this cashier has eaten so many cupcakes no one wants to fuck them anymore, they think they can keep me from my $1 chapstick!"" 

i remember i was putting someones lotto numbers into the touchscreen when she said that and all i could think was ""you are never getting that $1 now!! never!!!"" 

so, with that still not working, she starts saying she is going to call 911! yep, just starts threatening to call 911 over a $1 chapstick. now, at this point, the dwindling crowd of people are getting sick of her because they all have places to be and do not have time to be listening to this on their commute. so one of them just starts saying ""do it!"" and she keeps saying ""i will!"" and they keep saying ""then do it!"" and she keeps saying ""you don't think i won't?!"" back and forth until my coworker finally gets back from the bathroom.

before i could say or do anything, they just pulled $1 out of the register and gave it to her. they told me after she left that a couple people had complained of the same thing so they had done that a couple times already that morning, and my register was short because of it. 

awesome...

so, you would think this is where the story ends right?

not quite.

so, i decided that i might as well inform the chapstick company about their faulty product, and went to look them up. they didn't have an email, much to my surprise. they had a mailing address and a phone number, so i tried the phone number. 

it rings for a while, longer than you would think, and an elderly woman's voice pops up on the other end.

long elderly person conversation short, it was not the number to the chapstick company, it was a little old ladies number, but it was the number they printed on everything saying it was their number. this poor old woman got angry calls from people about their chapstick all day and night to the point where she was afraid to ever answer her phone and she just didn't know what to do!

i told her i was very sorry to bother her and i hoped she had a wonderful day and hung up.

i'm just glad i called her and not the woman who screamed at me at the store.

i also hope the company fixed their error, but from reading stories of people with similar phone number situations on various subreddits, it's up in the air. ",backingawayslowlynow,tfr

a regular came in and did his normal transaction.  even tipped (allowed, but no one but this guy does it regularly).  a short while later, we get a delivery.  it was snowing and i decided to help.  i slipped on some snow and my foot slid under the pickup's tailgate.  i noticed i kicked something.  it's a wallet.  i grab it and bring it in.

381,who fuel? easy fix.,"story from the old gas station.

this is one i've seen happen loads of times but only once with this outcome. putting gasoline in a diesel.

it is the worst horror story of gas station customers.

one guy did this. a full tank of gasoline in a diesel van.

here is what you should do: don't start the engine. go to counter, ask for help, make any call you need and find a mechanic with a tow truck.

on this particular occasion, the driver did none of that. he instead asks another random customer what to do. he told the guy to just crank the engine a flush the fuel through and the driver follows the instructions after moving the van to the staff parking area behind the store building. the staff, me included, only finds out what went wrong about ten minutes later when we see the driver running into the store, grabbing a fire extinguisher and legging out the door. a few seconds later there is a huge cloud of smoke.

the place evacuated and the fire department was called. the van was toast. heres the worst part. he was delivering the van to a dealership, its his first day on the job and his first delivery. the van had only 6 miles on the cloak.",radeakins,tfr
382,"""my husband is very sick!""","ltl, ftp. i haven't thought of this lady in quite some time.

i spent several years working in my local mall at a store which sold handcrafted items from developing countries. to provide a tiny bit of background info, the bulk of our merchandise was either home decor or jewelry. although the company does carry clothing at some of its stores, ours was very small, so we didn't really sell much of that; however, we did sell a couple of beautiful reversible alpaca wool capes from nepal, one of which features here. at the time of the story, we had been open for less than two months, so we were all still getting used to the company and the merchandise and the sales model.

this lady was probably the most memorable bad customer i encountered. she's what i picture when people mention an ""i want to speak to the manager"" haircut. i'm hard pressed to guess her age, but i'd approximate late fifties or early sixties, and she had this strong vibe coming off of her like she was convinced she was the most important person in the room. any room. this was over six years ago, so i'm approximating some of the dialogue, but the line about her husband was repeated so often that i know i have it burned into my memory forever.

&amp;#x200b;

it was a friday night in november that she sailed into the store and started looking around. i asked her if she was familiar with our company and she didn't answer.

""my husband is in the car and he's very sick. i don't have time to be shopping,"" she said.

*then why are you here?* i wondered, but could not actually say.

she pointed at one of the alpaca capes. ""how much is that?"" i quoted her the price.

again, she said, ""i really don't have time for this. my husband is very sick."" she paused slightly and then said, ""i want to try it on.""

""all right."" the alpaca capes were displayed high on the wall in order to deter theft, so i had to find the hook and get it down. this wasn't easy because, one, the hook in question was very slim, so using it to catch the hanger was a little tricky; and two, i am blind in one eye so my depth perception is pretty bad. i only mention this because it took a bit longer to get the cape down than she would have liked, and she was making her irritation known in little huffs.

finally, she tried on the cape and fussed with arranging the drapes. ""where is your mirror?""

""there are mirrors on the wall,"" i replied. this was true; we sold mirrors, and several of them were displayed in the jewelry area so that people could try on necklaces and whatnot. but what we *didn't* have was a full-length mirror.

""how can you sell clothing and not have a full-length mirror?"" she snapped. ""my husband's very sick! i don't have time for this!""

""i'm sorry, ma'am, this is the biggest mirror we have."" i gestured to the one in question.

she fussed with the garment a little longer, continuing to look pissy, and finally said, ""i don't have time for shopping. put this behind the register, i'll come back for it on monday."" (note that she explicitly said *monday.* it's actually the only reason i remember the story took place on a friday.)

""certainly, ma'am, i'll just need your name and phone number in order to hold it.""

""i don't have time for this, my husband is sick!"" but she gave me her first name and phone number, and disappeared. just after she left, one of my coworkers discovered that she had left behind her bag from another store, so we put it with the cape.

she called as soon as she got home, ranting about her missing purchases. we told her they were at the register with the cape she wanted held. we all agreed she was very odd for shopping with a sick spouse in the car, but whatever.

so the weekend went by, and monday rolled around, and i was told to call her and ask if she still wanted the cape. lucky me.

""hello, ma'am, this is myname from store at the friendly neighborhood mall. i was calling about the alpaca cape you had us hold for you - will you still be coming in to purchase it?""

""why are you harassing me? it's *monday*! i told you i would be in on *wednesday*!""

""...no, ma'am, i even have it written down that you would be in today.""

""i will be there *wednesday*."" she hung up on me.

she showed up on wednesday, and this time the store manager got to deal with her directly, although i was on hand to witness it. we gave her the bag she had left, and then pulled out the cape. she glared at it and asked, ""why is it all wrinkled?! where is your steamer?""

""we don't have one, ma'am. it got a little wrinkled being folded up, but the wrinkles come out easily.""

the lady sniffed and put it on again. ""i don't know why a store that sells clothing doesn't have a full-length mirror."" (as i stated above, we really *didn't* sell clothing.)

the manager took a big mirror off the wall. ""tell me where you need me to hold this so you can see yourself properly.""

""don't be ridiculous!"" she fussed at the cape some more. ""well, i'm not going to buy it. not all wrinkled like this.""

""well, i'm sorry to hear it,"" said the manager. ""we could have sold it over the weekend if we hadn't been holding it for you.""

""i doubt *that*,"" she replied, and left. at least this time she took her other bag.

383,“i don’t want gift cards that have been touched!”,"[insert apology for formatting as i’m on mobile here]

i work as a part-time cashier at a very popular superstore and have been there for almost three months. i know, i’m a newbie to the retail thing. this happened a week after i started working there, which was right in the middle of christmas rush. as you can imagine, it was busy.

for just a tiny bit of background, this was my first day on a register by myself. my first day was orientation, my second day was training videos on the computer, and then my third day i shadowed a senior cashier for a little while. i was supposed to be given more days of shadowing, but because of the rush, they just put me on a register and i was told to call over a manager if i had any questions.

things are going relatively well. most of it is pretty straightforward, and i just call over a manager anytime i’m not sure what to do. most of the customers are patient with me, despite the rush, and i’m feeling pretty confident in how i’m doing for somebody who’s only four days on the job.

in comes gift card lady. gcl = her, me = me.

me: hi! did you find everything alright?

gcl: for the most part. i’m having trouble finding gift cards.

this statement was, understandably, confusing. we have store gift cards and a few other franchise gift cards in each register lane, as well as a huge kiosk of them. hell, said kiosk was right outside my register lane!

me: i’m sorry about that. did you check the kiosk or these lanes?

gcl: uh, i want fresh cards. like, ones nobody has touched. don’t you have gift cards inside your register space?

we do not. if we have gift cards in our register space, they’re empty, already activated cards that we haven’t thrown out yet. but she’s insisting on fresh cards. a whole eleven of them.

to make this story shorter, i had to call over another employee to watch my register (we can’t lock the register if we have already started a transaction, and we can’t leave it unattended to avoid theft) while i ran and scoured each register for unactivated gift cards that had a christmas theme.

i found them after, like, twenty minutes of frantically searching each register space and she went on her way— after complaining very loudly that it had taken me that long. and no, i couldn’t just take them from the kiosk or the register lanes, as she was watching me like a hawk to make sure i didn’t.

the only thing worse was how, because again it was busy in there, i now had a line all the way to apparel full of huge orders. thank you, gcl.

384,"ma'am, i mean.. sir.","at a garden store i used to work at, we had only 2 (slow/rather manual) registers and in the bulk stuff we'd grow, we didn't put tags on everything. we also got really busy at growing season, and the line would be perpetually long. so we would have 2 people at the register, ringing people up, and sorting/counting items as they came through. i got flustered doing the latter, so i was often running the till. 

when i used to work a drive thru window, i learned to not get overwhelmed by realizing i only ever had to deal with 2 people at a time (window and speaker box), so i got tunnel vision a little, and had a script in my mind. it helped with my anxiety, too. 

at the garden center, similar thing. tunnel vision, script. i had gotten in to a habit of calling some people sir and ma'am every few people, if they weren't androgynous presenting. i thought to myself ""man, i'm going to accidentally call one of these people the wrong label,"" and probably within an hour, my self-fulfilling prophecy came true. it was a ~35 y/o man with his wife/girlfriend, and i don't know exactly but i think he asked me to do something for him after the transaction, no issue, ""yes ma'am"" 

o.o 

i looked at him, with a slightly amused/taken aback look on his face. i start apologizing, explaining i had gotten in the habit lately, and i had just been thinking i was going to do this accidentally. 

i(f) have a pixie cut, and i have been called sir multiple times, and i told him that briefly.

385,"well, i suppose it's technically theft.","hello those out in tfr land, i serve up a tale to you from my little corner of retail land, brought to you from my portable reddit accessing device.

as it's getting ever closer to the end of my shift, there is a quiet stillness within the store. it's empty, not a consumer soul to be found. alas, this peace was not to continue as someone entered the store.

this person, whom i could not tell if they were male or female, had entered with a single purchase in mind, a pre-paid credit card. normally this is an easy, straightforward purchase, but then i wouldn't be here if that was the case this time.

upon reaching the register, the customer informs me that they'd like to load money onto a pre-paid credit card, the package for one they are holding in their hand, along with their wallet. now this wallet is on the larger size, and the package was held behind it, barely visible. i tell them that transaction is cash only, which they are fine with, and also ask for the package so i can ring up the sale. they're oddly slightly reluctant to hand me the package, but eventually do, telling me they want to load $500 onto the card.

now, this amount is the largest the pos system will allow to be loaded onto a pre-paid card, and also prompts an id request. it's at this request where things get a bit more unusual, because as the customer digs through their wallet for their id, they mutter something along the lines of that one not being theirs. something in me wants to think they were talking about an id, but i can't be sure.

after digging for a few moments, they tell me their id is in their vehicle, and proceed to walk out the store, but not before i stop them, asking for the package for the pre-paid card, they having picked it up after i had set it on the counter, after scanning it for the sale. the customer tells me they're just going to be out and back in, and this being near the end of my shift, and after a long night, let them go.

&amp;#x200b;

one day, he said a skid of something (either toilet paper or paper towel, i think) came in and the brand had swans on the boxes. they cut out all the swans from the boxes and taped them around the manager's office. they then go on the store intercom and say ""\[manager\] please report to your office, we found the swan.""

390,nook bandit,"the post about the stolen xboxes reminded me of this one.

many moons ago i worked at a book store (not the one you probably think) where we sold nook tablets. a couple new models had come out and we had them on display on a specialized table near customer service in the middle of the store so we could keep an eye on them or answer questions. 

now, the display ones were (iirc) special display models that were cheaper than the real thing in case they got stolen. additionally, the boxes that were on the table were empty, just being there for show.

a couple new models get released and upper management directs us to move the table to the register area not ten feet from the doors. okay, not the best idea, but whatever. then they tell us to replace the empty boxes with actual product so the folks at the register can just grab one when making a sale.

we mention that this is a bad idea, that we could positively wrap the things in sensors and it wouldn't stop someone from grabbing them and bolting, but our protests are dismissed. they want it where they want it and they're the ones writing the paychecks. we actually had a betting pool on how long it would take before one got stolen.

three days later a guy walks in and passes through the store into the mall. as he was passing through he stopped and played with the display models, which was pretty normal. however, on his way back out he grabs a half dozen boxed tablets and two of the display models and books it out the door. one of the cashiers actually stepped out and got his plate number, but i never heard if he got caught or not.

we ended up losing hours because our shrinkage was shot due to the theft, and within a couple months i quit for other reasons. didn't even win the pool since i'd claimed two days.",cajuncrustacean,tfr
391,that time an angry customer nearly broke the door,"first time poster, sorry for any mistakes. also, no dialogue because i can't remember and didn't hear a lot of it.

so, a couple of years back i worked at a department store near my home. work was easy (i worked recovery) and i wasn't there long, but i did see meet some weird people. this, though, was the worst.

it was just after black friday, the store was still a mess, and i was working the late shift with about five other people on the main floor, the woman's section. now, the store isn't very big, but it has four floors so the staff was pretty spread out and if something happened in one floor, the other floors wouldn't know it. 

on this night things were going pretty well and we were supposed to get out at around 11. it was near the end of the shift when the angry customer appeared.

at first, she just knocked on the double doors at the back, the ones that led to the almost empty parking lot. one of the supervisors went over to see what she wanted. apparently, this woman was trying to pick up something she ordered online. problem is, the store was closed. we closed at 9 and it was just past 10. this was explained to her.

apparently, we were lying.

she insisted that the store closed later. which we did, during black friday. she was told the hours but wouldn't give up and kept demanding that we let her in, pounding on the door and screaming bloody murder, eventually kicking it. she kept saying she wanted her package and that she was gonna get us fired. finally, she kicked the door so hard, the corner of the glass kinda cracked and the whole double doors shook. around this time, we started wondering wtf was in the package.

police was called, and the woman left. we thought that was the end. if it had been i would have left on time.

but the crazy woman parked across the street from the small parking lot. we could see her from the store, waiting in her car, probably glaring at the shop full of mostly young women. police was called, but she left before they got there (probably saw them coming since the streets were empty). 

in the end, we had to wait for everyone to be ready to leave and had a ride so no one would be left alone. ended up leaving around midnight.

the worst thing is i still don't know wtf was in the package that was so important.
