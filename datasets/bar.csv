0,"the ""i need advice"" thread.","**read the rules and the links in the sidebar** here's a collection of wise advice given by fellow bartenders of reddit. if you'd like to add something you haven't seen here, please do so.

&gt;assholes happen. this one happened to be playing the race card, but it's not the only one in the deck.
the superiority card (businesspeople, hipsters).
the ""all about me"" card (bachelorettes, 21st birthday).
the association card (""i'm a bartender, too"").
when someone who has had too much orders a drink, i suggest water or coffee on the house instead. if they question me, i'm empathetic, but firm:
""i'm sorry sir/ma'am, but you're showing signs of intoxication and it's illegal for me to serve you.""
no judgement, no snarkiness. just facts.
if it's a regular, even easier:
""sorry ""bob"", but that's it for the night. i care about 'ya and wanna make sure you get home in one piece.""
failing that, a quote from my favorite television lawyer:
""some people are immune to good advice"" -- saul goodman.
don't let it get to you. you were being a responsible bartender and i think that's fucking awesome.

/u/nomoreadviceanimals - on change, adapting and growing.
&gt; are you making better money? does the bar you work at make more money than the bar you used to work at? is there anything you can learn from this switch?
i used to think that if i wasn't bartending at a craft cocktail place, then i was wasting my time. i went from a nationally renowned cocktail bar to a high volume mid-level nightclub and thought that was the end of my career. here's the thing though:
you need to be able to excel in every kind of environment. when i started up at the nightclub, i realized that while, yeah, i could make a round of eight different prohibition style drinks with perfect efficiency, there were a whole lot of areas i was lacking; could i make a customer just as stoked with their vodka soda as i could with a fancy cocktail with fresh juice and homemade syrups? was i able to work not just efficiently, but cleanly as well? was my wine knowledge where it should be? could i work side by side with other bartenders (lots of higher volume places have shared wells for efficiency, as opposed to the more common 1 well per bartender setup of high volume craft cocktail places)?
fact of the matter was, no matter how hot shit i was with cocktails, no matter how many big competitions i won, it was humbling as fuck to get behind the bar at a vodka-soda-shot-and-beer nightclub and get smoked by a 21 year old. this hasn't just happened to me: as the craft cocktail scene gets saturated and yeah maybe even played out, i know alot of bartenders that have made the move to different styles of service, be it nightclubs or restaurants or neighborhood dives. if, like a lot of folks who started in the industry while the craft cocktail boom was at it's peak, you've had the bulk of your experience in a suspenders-and-jiggers style bar, you're going to come to the realization that sometimes you still have a lot to learn.
and learn i did. i went from lamenting the fact that i was stuck making espresso martinis and cosmos for unappreciative guests to trying to figure out where the gaps in my knowledge and skillset were and learning everything all over again. from there, i was able to work my way into a nationally renowned french fine dining restaurant, and the same shit happened again. my service was clumsy and awkward compared to the guys who'd cut their teeth in fine dining, i had to constantly run to the somms for advice on which obscure wine to recommend, and shit man, i had to learn how to do fucking latte art.
but i learned.
i think a lot of today's craft cocktail bartenders have some serious blindspots. looking back (and to each side, where i see a bunch of other ex-craft cocktail bartenders who've experienced similar), most of my peers in the craft cocktail community would struggle just as hard as i did in the same environment. working in different styles of places allows you to learn and learn something that's not just ""yeah but when did the word 'cocktail' reeeallly first appear in print?""
you can learn how these ""shitty"" bars make a fuckton of money. you can learn how to maintain good service even when you feel like your skills aren't being properly appreciated. you can learn how to make a customer tell you that your ""jack and coke recipe"" is the best one they've ever had, but most importantly you can learn how to inspire the bartenders around you to become better.

/u/lifeiskarma - on stress and pressure.
&gt;one of my favorites is: ""slow is smooth, smooth is fast."" especially when in the weeds, staying focused and not rushing yourself can prevent those unnecessary mistakes.

&amp;nbsp; 

/u/mambouli  - on knowledge
&gt;no. do practice flair. get to know every part of bartending, showmanship as well. even if you don't do flair at work, being good at it will make you more fluid and make less accidents. catching things become a second nature. remember that only those who can't flair raise their nose on it.
but sure, that is definitely not the most important part of the job.
what you can get, easily and for free, is knowledge. with internet and specifically wikipedia, there is no excuse to not know everything about the products you serve.
how is vodka made? what is the difference between gin and vodka. what is the difference between bombay and beefeater gins, in terms of production and its effect on flavor. what's the difference between a bourbon, a rye, an irish whisky and a scotch. what's the difference between a single malt and a blended. what are the different regions of scotch. what's the difference between cognac and armagnac, what grapes are used in cognac? what does vsop stand for? what grapes are used in pisco and where does it come from? why can't disaronno can't legally be labeled as amaretto anymore? what medical ingredient can you find in tonic water? what type of honey goes into drambuie? what's the difference between a lager and an ale, why are some lagers darker than others? what are the grapes used to make bordeau? how about bourgogne? get to know every french wine making region. what grapes are tipically used in the loire valley? what difference in characteristics can you expect between a loire valley wine and a cotes du rousillon wine. how is champagne made? how is rosé made? how is champagne rosé made? how do you make tequila, what's the difference between patron and sauza? what is grappa? how is port wine made? what's the difference between a ruby, a tawny, a vintage or a lbv? what are the different kind of xeres one can find? how is pineau des charentes made? how are sauternes made? what is angostura bitters? what is vermouth? what is orgeat syrup?
get to know all your classic cocktails. the american bartender association can be considered the absolut reference. and then get to know the new trends in bartending (often pompously called mixology)
who cares about this hotel. the important thing, is that from now on, you can write bartender on your resume. now read and learn. read and learn. read and learn. the rest, you can only learn on the job.

/u/lord_thundercunt - on barbacking and teamwork
&gt;so a good barback will work seamlessly with his bartenders. it's a damn shame that's not you kid. it's day one and you don't know a pint glass from a hole in the ground. here's some tips to try and help you out on that first day and the upcoming week.
things to look for:
1 . is your bar low on: ice glassware, fruit, beer, condiments, liquor bottles, napkins/coasters, towels?
2 . does your bar currently have too many/much: empty beer bottles, garbage, messes?
keep an eye on these things and fix them when they are wrong.
you need to know:
1 . where do you keep: ice kegs, beer bottles/cans, liquor, fruit, general supplies.
2 . what is expected of you: do you need to run food for the servers, do you need to clean the bathrooms, etc.
3 . you need to learn: everything you can. if it's your first night, try not to sweat it too much but during down time ask questions, learn the menu, pick up a bar book and learn some basic cocktails, the names of glassware you carry.
3.1 you need to learn everything you can about the people around you. will mike chew you out for stepping behind the bar when he's busy? does joe expect you to come behind the bar when he's busy and start working the service wells? does sarah like the bar set up differently than everyone else?
section 3.1 is something you'll only learn with time and communication. talk to your fellow employees and ask them what they like, what they need day to day.
what you need to do:
1 . listen. your bartender is going to call things out. usually what ever he just ran out of.
2 . look. make sure to pay attention to the items listed in the first section and be ready to refill them before they run out.
2.1 look at your surroundings. is someone obviously drunk? let your bartender or your bouncer know. you're an extra set of eyes on the floor, you may see something the bartender missed. same goes for messes and unsafe conditions.
3 . hustle! your bar/bartender is going to need things in a timely fashion.
i hope this helps!

/u/t_p_h_ - on barbacking and teamwork
&gt;there is only one rule needed for a bar back guide.
1) bartenders make their money off of tips. as a rule, tips are a percentage of total sales. anything you can do to make sure that your bartenders time is spent making a sale instead of prepping for a sale will make your bartender love you. identify anything your bartender does that is not tied directly to making a sale and provide that service to your bartender.
stocking ice, beer, fruit is all obvious. grabbing a rail vodka... obvious. going into the cooler and lifting kegs and letting your bartender know that lips of faith wild double has only a few pints left before it blows all over her.... she loves you. letting your bartender know that somethings getting ready to be 86'd before they sell those 5 shots of that item... they love you. anticipate the upcoming problem so that they can continue service uninterrupted.
when it's knee deep in the weeds, bartenders have tunnel vision. you are their unannounced, unaware, oblivious world view on the bar. you have so thoroughly fulfilled your job that the bartender doesn't even understand your purpose. you do these unrewarding things so that they can make the next sale relying not on thought but muscle memory. they haven't asked you for a thing. the magical ice fairy stocked the bin, the trash cans are bottomless and the gods of correctly scored cut fruit are benevolent.

&amp;nbsp;

/u/missyaley  - on barbacking and teamwork
&gt;1.	don't slack off. bartending and barback are high paced roles, and if you aren't prepared to give 110% energy every day, it's not the job for you. especially if you are looking to be promoted later on, you want to be reliable.
2.	don't look down on your role. the position exists because it's needed. be proud of the work you put into your role. (you're basically the bar superman, i mean really.)
3.	it's likely you will cut yourself (maybe a lot.) investing in some band aids and neosporin before you need them will help.

 /u/jros13 - on stress and pressure
&gt;i wanted to share some advice with my favorite subreddit. a while back my gm told me about how he deals with the general public when people are at their worst.
there is no such thing as a ""cheeseburger emergency."" no one should have to drop what they're doing for a burger. no one should run in fear of a burger. no one should be angry or sorry about a goddamned burger. it's a burger! bread, meat, cheese, toppings. that's it.
if a burger is late, under/overcooked, has the wrong toppings, or isn't what they expected, it is not the end of the world. it can be re-made, comped, or replaced with something else.
however, some people may treat their perceived ""cheeseburger emergency"" like it's the end of the world. they'll whine, complain, maybe even scream about their burger. they'll stiff you on a $100 tab. they'll threaten to get you fired. they'll insult and ridicule you.
the thing you have to remember is that if a damned cheeseburger is really the worst thing to happen to them today, they've got something else going on in their personal lives. you can't let their problems get to you.
out loud, you say ""i'm so sorry about that. let's get it fixed."" but to yourself, you're saying ""i'm sorry that you're in such a bad way that a cheeseburger caused you to act like this to a complete stranger in public.""
the ""cheeseburger emergency"" can really be anything. ""i didn't get my extra ranch,"" ""this isn't top shelf,"" ""i've been waiting 20 minutes!,"" ""i said well done!,"" etc.
just some advice to everyone if you find yourself angry or stressed during your shift. if you like comedian patton oswalt, his skycake bit is similar.
go make some money this weekend and don't get bogged down by cheeseburger emergencies!

&amp;nbsp;

/u/seriousgourmetshit on dealing with rude/douchey customers
&gt;another way i like to think of situations like these is to liken the person to a monkey. you can't really get angry at a monkey because they flail their arms around and make a scene when their water doesn't have lemon, because well, they are just a monkey. and any attempts to reason with them fails because again, they are just a monkey.

tonight, two of my coworkers and i went out for drinks after a busy night at work (we’re dispatchers) and the place we went to is known for its cocktails. the bartender we had was so thoughtful and really knew his shit! we asked so many questions and he never made us feel dumb for asking what certain ingredients were, etc. he spent time asking us about our night and questions about our line of work.. he also gave us a discount off our tab at closing time without us asking! bartenders are so much more than the job title describes them as! so this is a huge thank you to the bartenders who take time to listen to random people’s problems/stories without acting put off in any sort of way!

12,fucking “dodger mark” strikes again,"baseball season is upon us, which usually is a time for celebration in my house. this year is no different. i had the pleasure of bringing my daughter back to the bay area for opening day at the coliseum. for those of you who know me, that’s a huge success in my ongoing battle for custody. we were able to celebrate our third opening day together, which ended with my customary purchase of a new hat at the stadium (a slick-ass black a’s hat with “oil slick” painted metal logo on 60% discount from last years surplus) and baseball cards for the little lady.

however, this also means the return of dodger mark (aka mark doyer aka rainmark aka mister dodgerlina, mister mark dodgerlina). one of the perks of working at the craft beer sports bar is that all of the staff minus the barback are a’s fans so it’s the one guaranteed place to catch an oakland game in sf now that tee off has changed ownership. but, being an sf bar, we still are obligated to show giants games.

the giants happened to be playing in la, which means the most obnoxious dodger fan i know was once again gracing us with his presence, which includes his customary brash lobbying of other patrons to become dodger fans. this is usually performed with a rainman-esque shouting of “dawwwdgers!” and “you should be a dodgers fan!”, followed by a vocal census of “who wants to watch the dodgers?!” (spoiler: last time he did this he failed to raise his own hand, leading to a grand total of zero people.)

unfortunately, a couple from la waltzed in during the second inning, leading rainmark to believe that the majority of the bar wanted to watch the sf/la game and informing me of the “perfect game” julio uriah’s was tossing in the second fucking inning. (for non-baseball fans, rule #1 of a perfect game is you do not mention the perfect game. rule #2 is that it isn’t even worthy of attention until the 6th inning.)

the cherry on top was when he stopped a potential customer at the door and told them not to bother coming in because “this is a sports bar that hates sports. there are better places to go around the corner.”

by the way, mister mark dodgerlina, you owe me $100. don’t drive business away when you’re already in the hole, or i’ll just add a 2-beer asshole tax to your outstanding debt.

32,questioning leadership,"let me preface this by saying i never want to be ""that"" guy. the new guy who comes in and starts criticizing everything the preexisting staff are doing. 

&amp;#x200b;

however, i've started working at a trendy speakeasy-style cocktail bar in town, and at first i was very excited about the program, but i'm starting the have some major second thoughts and i don't know how to proceed or if i should say anything.

&amp;#x200b;

first, a little backstory. when i applied to this place, i was very impressed. the venue is gorgeous, there's live music every week, lots of events, private parties, holiday specials, the cocktail list was very strong, and the spirit selection was very well put together. i found out the bar manager had just put forward his notice of resignation, so i applied for that position, which i have experience in. they told me that they would be giving the position to a bartender that already worked there, which i of course understand. it may be important to note, it will be that guy's first bar manager position.

&amp;#x200b;

i ended up working at a restaurant in town. i really enjoyed it there. the bar program is so-so, but the food is incredible and the management gave me a lot of freedom and asked me a lot of questions about bar programs in general, and about 4 weeks later they actually offered me a bar manager position. 

&amp;#x200b;

but then the cocktail bar called and offered me a bartender position. i was originally really excited about this place and the opportunity to have more like-minded peers, so i took the position, gave the restaurant a two-weeks notice, as well as helped recruit and train my replacement. they also told me that they'd love to have me back anytime they had room for me.

&amp;#x200b;

since then, i've been on the border to regret with that decision. i am one of three bartenders there, one of which is the bar manager, and the other is rather inexperienced and has been asking *me* questions since i started. both of them don't really engage their guests at the bar, and go right back to socializing with the rest of the staff on the back bar as soon as there are no more drinks to make. the new bar manager has put together the spring cocktail list, which is *very* basic. there's very few housemade ingredients, of which none are infusions or bitters, little utilization of amaros, mistelles, and fortified wines, and just last night i overheard him say we'll no longer be carrying buffalo trace or blanton's because they're too ""unreliable""/""hard to get"". 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm unsure of what to do in this situation. i don't want to be insubordinate and tell management how to manage or tell my coworkers how to work, and i can't really go back to the restaurant seeing as how i trained my replacement, who they are looking to promote to bar manager once he gets up to speed. any tips? am i an idiot?

&amp;#x200b;

**tl:dr** \- resigned a restaurant job where i made good money and that offered me bar manager to work in a really cool speakeasy. the speakeasy has a new, inexperienced bar manager that  is making decisions that i don't agree with. i can't go back to the same position i had before because i trained my replacement.",Mcsonofabitch,bar

&amp;#x200b;

so anyway i contacted this club and they asked what position i was interested in, i said whatever is available/ you think is best - as i really have no idea... and the person said a cocktail waitress would be best (of course...........................)

&amp;#x200b;

anyway, i should be talking with the hiring manager soon in the next couple of days, and then the person today told me that after i talk to the manager, that i should come by on thursday to discuss/ look around/ ask questions etc. well he mainly said ""come party"" on thursday (?? i just said okay, even though i dont party alone, and i dont like to drink with strangers and im supposed to be there to see if i even want to step foot in that place again to work.... not exactly to have fun... but hopefully he was just being nice and friendly, not literal. i honestly just want to take a look around, meet manager/ staff, talk money/ hours and leave) 

&amp;#x200b;

my questions... what exactly does  cocktail waitress do at a nightclub? not stripclub... i've never been to a night club in america, only in europe. they didn't have girls wearing sexy outfits (another question on this below) , if you wanted to get a mixed drink you go to the bar and order and come back to your table etc... and mainly they have men wearing casual/ classy casual taking care of your hookah/ drinks/ ice etc etc if you had a table. so what does a cocktail waitress do???? and i never tipped/ people i went with never tipped anyone in the bar... (but then again, tipping is an option in the part of europe i was in). so like will i even get tips (guaranteed) or is it just a possibility depending on the customers?

&amp;#x200b;

also, is it normal for the women to wear skimpy lingerie outfits?! like i would be totally totally fine with a dress or skirt but like.... lingerie? its less showy than a bikini at the beach, but still... is that normal? i even asked if this was a stripclub or regular club, and he said it was a regular night club. 

&amp;#x200b;

apparently the only days i'd be working is friday and saturday... im also considering if thats even worth  it cause ideally i'd like to make $250+ a shift, (over 3-4 shifts) but since it's only two days, i would like to make like 700+ for those 2 shifts, and i just think thats totally unrealistic... but i dont know? 

&amp;#x200b;

the pictures, it looks like a big club (not freaking huge, but it is 2 stories, has 5 bars inside and looks decently sized (but who knows maybe in person its so small). its definitely not super upscale?? but its not ""ghetto"" either - i tried to aim for some ""upscale"" clubs despite my lack of experience, as the more casual/ ""ghetto"" ones are really intimidating to me. 

&amp;#x200b;

so my questions:

&amp;#x200b;

1) what does a cocktail waitress actually do

2) is it normal for the women to wear skimpy outfits like legit lingerie

3) what can i expect from tips? downtown in a big city, moderately decent sized club and doesnt seem ghetto?",OrganicEnid,bar

so i am thinking that i need to leave my job. it has soured, and it’s just really not very healthy for me mentally right now. it’s due to a bad manager which i posted about a bit back. i can’t change jobs for at least a couple more months, but i’m wondering how you all deal with the financial instability part of it all. i’m in school right now so my finances pretty much cover basic living expenses and that’s it because i want to spend as much time focusing on school as possible. if i change jobs i have no idea what type of money i can expect and i don’t have a ton of savings to pay for a new job that falls short of what i thought it should money wise. i have been at this bar for so long my schedule is very consistent and i know what to expect. during the summer i have a few months where i could have the two jobs at once and see if anything pans out, but i really don’t just want to have to pull out a ton of student loans to pay for my life. how do you guys deal with that aspect of changing jobs, both mentally and practically?",mixeddrinksandmakeup,bar

52,words of wisdom from one of my bartending buddies.,"in texas. 

just a few tips from you friendly neighborhood bartender. 

if you are having more than two drinks and you are paying with a card start a damn tab. i really hate having to run your card 12 times for each drink. why? 

if you dip that’s fine. ask me for a spit cup!!!! don’t use your empty pint glass.

don’t shove napkins in your glass either. that annoys me. 

stop tearing up your damn coaster all over the bar!! 

when you see more than one bartender behind the bar, yes we can all get you a drink and have access to your tab. don’t tell me that joe has your tab. i’m here, he is busy, what the hell do you want and what is your last name. simple 

dont fold your signed cc receipt in half and stab your pen through. what in the actual hell are you thinking. 

if it’s slammed and you finally get my attention have your order ready. don’t get me and then ask your table what they want to drink. 

this one is important!!! asking for less ice in your glass does not mean your drink will be stronger! you will get more mix. so if you think you will get more booze you are strongly mistaken my friend. 

i’m sure there are plenty more i just can’t think of them at the moment. be a friendly patron. i speak for myself but i try to go out of my way to make your experience memorable and i want everyone to have a good time. but there are rules. dont be a dick !!!",texastica,bar

56,to query and to vent - semi long,"i been coming to this page for awhile. i've only bartended at chain restaurants. still slinging drinks. bartending now in my later years isn't what it was like when i was younger. the times have changed. i took a hiatus to manage for almost 10 years. stepped down from it because cancer came into my mom's life, and i figured bartending would give me the flexibility in my schedule to see her whenever i wanted. sadly it took her and since she passed i've been in a rut, but stayed doing the job because of the money.
slinging drinks at a chain, they made me a trainer and i trained most of the people i work with. trust me they promote only the people that have flexibility in their schedule, so most of the time it the people that move at a snails pace that get trained. instead of training the person that's got a fire under their ass and moves like kid all hyped on red bull, i get the girl that can't bail herself out from 2 service tickets, or the guy that i've caught pocketing tip money instead of putting it in the jar. last night with these ncaa tourney games, was another debacle. weed girl vanishes for almost 45 minutes, while i'm training another victim of the slow movers club, and doesn't manifest herself almost an hour later.""where were you,may i ask? so and so wanted me to run the expo line. i just got cut, and i'm going to do my outs. the hell you are. you're not collecting tip out for an hours worth a work when you were not out here pouring a drink. here's your cut, don't bother doing anything.""
well wouldn't you know it's had a cryer. got pulled in the office with tonya tears, while the trainee was alone at the bar. she explained her side, saying that the manger pulled her back there, blah blah blah. i waited patiently for my turn. when she was done, i looked at her and asked if she was completely done. she said yes. i looked at the manager and said only this:
me- let me give a scenario. when you go to the strip club and get a dance. if she starts, but all of a sudden disappears for almost an hour, comes back and finishes the dance, do you still pay her? too vulgar? ok a little more on the disney side. if you had a car that needed $20 gas, but only put in $5 worth, do you let the gas station keep the rest? i don't think so. was it busy, yes? does it constitute pulling the back up bartender to bail your asses out of a clinch because you guys aren't successful in realizing that there are big games on and scheduled servers who have 30lb weights in their shoes? that's neither here nor there. the fact remains i and a trainee on their 2nd day had a make drinks for 30 tabs at the bar and another 300 bodies in the building. sure i could of came back and grabbed her, but i was praying and hoping that someone of authority had some common sense to realize that pulling a bartender was the last thing to do. three managers were in the building and none of them could have given me a heads up and say we're pulling so and so for a couple minutes. but for almost an hour i'm not working for 2 people when i and a rookie are getting our butts handed. so if there is anything else i'm going back to my bar, finishing this night, and going home to a tall drink that better put out.

needless to says shit like this happens all the time. get out you say, find another place to go... i know. i've been looking, joked a few times and said that when i win the jackpot they'll know when i don't show. i'm not religious, don't have a deity to speak to. but the day will come, i feel it my bones.",chinaco276,bar

60,technical question regarding payment for bar being shut down for a week (california),"heyyyy! advice needed, did some research but figured i would get more insight from my peers. 

so i work at a hotel bar in california. there is a company that is buying out the entire property (kitchen and bar included) for 7 days next month. they are kosher and don’t drink, so the only employees out of the entire hotel staff that have to work during this period are dishwashers and barbacks. we (bar staff)were never “officially” told about this, we all got info from each other, and it was just confirmed from my manager on thursday. 

i work there full time, and when i asked on thursday if full time employees would be paid for this week when the bar is closed, i was told that if i wanted to be paid for that week it would have to come out of my pto. is this legal? i read something that said that in order for the company to not pay full time employees for any amount of time that we needed to be formally told 90 days before about this hotel buyout, which didn’t happen. like i said, the only info we got was from each other, and we just got confirmation thursday that it was more than a rumor. should we be getting paid for this week off work?

they started screaming at the manager that they know the owner (they don’t) and that he’s acting crazy. they come up to me at the bar and ask what the manager’s name is and i ask “did he tell you his name?” they say yes so i ask “what did he say?” at that point the lady who asked me told her friends not to speak to me because i’m being crazy. she asks me what his problem is and i ask her what happened. she says the manager is belligerent and rude and so i ask her what happened again and what the problem is. she freaks out and starts telling her friends they should leave and not pay. after i told them their friend can’t sleep in the bar, they left without paying.

he tabbed out, went to his gate and discovered he was delayed.  he made it back by 8 am.  he reopens another tab with a double, finishes it and goes for another.  at this point, i made him a glass of ice water, biggest we had and asked him to go ahead and work on that before we proceed with any more drinks.  stunned, he recants 'why?'.  i explain to him he's had 3 doubles within an hour and fifteen minutes and that he needs to drink water and/or order something to eat.  he scoffs saying he doesn't want to be getting up to use the pisser every 15 minutes during his flight.  he then continues to murmur about how he's safe certified and wasn't aware that any drinks + time period would constitute being cut off but he 'is okay with it'.  he did one of those things where he's looking at the guests around him trying to find someone to side with him.  nope.

94,compression socks are amazing.,"y'all might know about them already, but i just started wearing them. i was born with an ankle problem and also have extremely flat feet, for which i wear orthotic  inserts.  i've spent my entire food service career just dealing with the foot, ankle, and calf pain after a long shift because i didn't think there was anything i could do about it. 

after having a few months off from bartending, i recently started a new job and was dreading the leg pain. the first couple of days were especially rough since my body had become used to not being on my feet much.  (and my shoes suck.)

i had an epiphany after wrapping my bad leg with an ace bandage so i could get to sleep - what if i used compression *during* my shift instead of just after? went on amazon and bought a cheapo set of compression socks (moderate compression - 15 to 20 hhmg) that arrived on my friday.  i put them on and my legs felt better almost immediately.  it was like fucking magic!

the moderate ones helped, but i still had some foot and leg pain at the end of a long shift or week, so i bought a second set with slightly more compression (20-30 hhmg). i wore them to work every day last week and my legs feel like i spent the week on the couch.  i barely even have pain in my fucked up ankle. and i'm still wearing the shitty shoes, even.  (i ordered new ones that didn't fit and i'm trying to get them exchanged now. speaking of, anyone got any recommendations for high quality, black, non-canvas nonslip shoes? )

the socks aren't a total cure all. i still have some leg stiffness and lower back pain, but it's a huge difference compared to normal socks.  

if any fellow bartenders deal with foot or leg pain, i highly recommend checking out compression socks.  i promise i'm not some sort of shill either - i have no idea what brands of socks i bought. they were the cheapest at their compression level on amazon. i just have been bursting with the need to rave about them to someone, but most of my friends work desk jobs. )",crazycoffin,bar

&amp;#x200b;

i was recently hired, second job/3 shifts a week, as a bartender at a restaurant that will be opening a franchise near me. the training bartender has come from another store to train us and this will be her permanent store. from conversations i overheard, she wants to make sure she will still keep her 6 shifts a week, she thinks the corporate hiring manager hired way too many bartenders that don't know what they're doing, and looks down on those hired with out experience. although the hiring manager and the listed ad for the position said no experience required, just in search of a bright personalities. 

&amp;#x200b;

i've been very excited to start and have been watching creeping this sub, watching youtube videos of bar techniques, making flashcards of drink recipes, liquor facts, correct glassware etc. so after 5 days of menu/procedure training, the first day they opened i was not on the schedule yet because of my primary job but i was assured i did great during training and the scheduling manager wants me on the floor asap. i decided to come in and sit at the bar and watch the bar trainer work and leave her a nice tip since i know i will need more training that most. she was absolutely horrid to me, the only guest at her bar, along with my boyfriend. she was so rude to me that the other bartender, who is very kind, apologized for her behavior multiple times and eventually took over my ticket. the other bartender started her apologies with ""she's really a sweet girl, must be having a bad day"" and by the time i was leaving she said that she was young, childish and crazy. 

&amp;#x200b;

i texted the manager that trained me, who told me i would be scheduled for the bar, about the experience i had. i mentioned that i came in to learn and tip, the experience was tense and uncomfortable for my bf and me, and she was so terrible to me that another employee (who i mentioned by name) apologized for her behavior multiple times for multiple microaggressions and eventually took over my ticket. i said at the nd of the text that i would be willing to rework my schedule or, if i had to, i would drop down to server in order to avoid tension with another employee. i can deal with rude customers with a smile, but my trainer bizarrely hating me, i can not handle. 

&amp;#x200b;

the manager i texted said that she would get back to me today. what do you guys think? some points to make: this bartender is slightly younger than me and i'm 23, which seems crazy to be an ""experience snob"" at such an early point in your career. all of the other bartenders are in their 40s so part of me thinks she just doesn't want another young woman bartending because she was very kind to them.  if everything doesn't work out, i really have no attachment to the job and would prefer not to have a second job than to have a toxic environment to walk in to everyday. i really want this job to pay for a kitchen renovation but my primary job does cover all of my expenses and saving.

112,disclosing health issues in interviews,"hi everyone. i have no idea if this is the right sub for this, but whatever.

i'm a bartender who sustained a really bad  back injury at my last job about a year ago. i'm well enough now that i can get around without pain most days, though at times i get some nerve pain. heavy lifting is all right in small doses. 

unfortunately i also have some gi issues. hasn't been diagnosed yet but has some hallmarks of crohn's. i adjusted my diet and seen some major progress in reducing frequency/severity of flare-ups but they still happen occasionally.

i know that both of those things make me kind of a pain in the ass to work with, even though i do my best to bust my ass to make up for it. i'm outta money and i can't do anything else, though. there's a restaurant near me that hiring and i really need to go for it, even if it's only part time.

my friends are telling me to keep my mouth shut about my, uh, ailments. but i know that if i get hired a) they're gonna find out eventually because b) i'm gonna need help. i can't do a lot of heavy lifting, that means someone else will. i gotta drop everything to run to the john real quick, it's on someone else to cover me for five minutes. i'm not trying to screw anyone over with this.

should i be upfront about all this or just stfu and do the interview like i'm not a 98-year-old man in a 32-year-old body? thanks in advance.",pancake_luncheon,bar
113,"should i do things my bar's way or the ""right"" way?","apologies for the long post!  


i'm pretty new to the sub, and to the position as well. short story about me: i got hired to be the bouncer at the bar that my best friend works at. it's a college town so it gets really crazy. i only work one night a week (saturdays, the second busiest night, but the most profitable in tips by far. i already work two other jobs and am a full time student so this is all i could squeeze in). my manager asked me if i wanted to bartend at some point because he wants everyone on staff to be able to do both (at least the guys). i got trained by him in the basics in roughly an hour and a half when we weren't open and it was just training time. 

  
i sucked my first shift, but the last couple of weeks have been really fun and i've improved dramatically. i get comments about it from the regulars and most of the people on staff seem really happy that i'm picking it up quick, as i'm better now than a girl who started bartending like a month before me. i kinda fell in love with it, and i want to make sure i can be the best that i can. i'm learning drinks and stuff on my own, trying to create a signature drink for the bar, and really looking into being better at my job as a whole. as it is, i get to tend for at least a couple hours a night, and if i get better, i could stay behind the bar all night (that's the goal). 

&amp;#x200b;

in my reading and learning i've seen that my bar is very ... unconventional? (can't think of the right word here). i see that a lot of what the bartenders at my bar do is basically wing it. i see different pour counts all the time, and recipes are different (my dad complained that i learned how to make a long island without tequila among other things). i also was taught by my manager to always pour the ice first into the mixed drinks so that it will dilute more, but i've been reading a lot on here that ice should (typically) be put in last so things don't dilute too much.  i'm not sure if i should be trying to follow the ""normal"" or standard procedure that is most often used, or if i should be doing it my bars way, since everyone basically does it differently anyway. i just don't want my manager to get mad at me (super chill dude, but pointing out that no one in the bar does things the same way would probably not look good for me as a relatively new hire and a new bartender). i have had customers note that we all tend differently and that the drinks we make aren't the same either. i had one woman who got 3 martinis from me and was happy, but as soon as another bartender made one, she didn't finish it and said she wasn't going to, and decided to leave because i was helping someone else and didn't get to her again immediately. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm not sure if this is a common problem or if this is just something that is happening because it is a college town and we have such a quick service pace that it doesn't really matter. i'd really like to get the bar back to its glory days of being a nice cocktail lounge that people would drive all over for, and that had a consistent clientele.  the last part is my biggest focus and something that i really tried doing from my start as a bouncer, but now that i'm trying to be behind the bar, i'm hoping that there is a good chance that i can really get that built up again. any thoughts on 

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: i started bartending, learned things differently than most people seem to have after doing research and learning on my own. not sure if i should be doing things the way i'm learning in the bar (everyone has their own system basically and it's all winging it) or if i should be trying to do things the way i've been learning based on other things.

i’m afraid of the [peter principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_principle) which states:
“the peter principle is a concept in management developed by laurence j. peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their ""level of incompetence"". in other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.”

i’m afraid of a few things, the most of which are:

•not being able to be the boss of a grumpy old chef who is known for throwing tantrums
•stepping away from the bar (if i have to i guess) and letting someone else manage that (it’s my baby of 3.5 years)
•employees not respecting me in this new position
•not being able to make tips! i’ve been making tips for 10 years, i manage my finances around this. it’d be tough for me to live with being paid once every two weeks
•not making, or not feeling like i’m making, as much money. (tips)

i've been bartending at this bar for 6 months and i was told i got the job based on my looks and not my previous experience (thanks i guess?). anywho i got stuck with a shit shift from 4:30pm to 10pm 3 days a week. i am not allowed to do a closing shift because my boss (the owner) has no faith in me to handle crazy customers at night, so i'm making no money.

my boss told me that the shift sucks right now because previous bartenders didn't do their job to keep customers in. it has not improved, and it's clear customers like me. she somehow believes facebook is how we get customers in, so for a few months i rolled with it and tried to create facebook posts to get people in. i would take a whole 5 minutes to think of something and post it, just to find an hour later the post was changed. after getting sick of that i started checking in to see if it was good enough. which took another hour of texting between me and my boss about the post or finally her saying ""i'll just do it"".

each day i get about 5 messages from her about work or asking me to share events to all her facebook friends. it's exhausting. if i'm not at work i'm not doing it.

she usually hangs out at the bar for the last half of my shift while i'm working. she has made a big deal about things such as my standing position at the bar, and how to talk to customers. she thinks i offended a customer with how i said something and i nearly got torn a new one. i didn't. that same customer loves me and actually told me to get a new job and provided me with connections to a busier bar in the area.

i won't go into any detail as to why they might have done this as it might expose the chain, but now the process is tied tho the tab amount on the till, gratuity prompt is removed and you can't take a payment any greater than the amount owed on the tab.

since the change, pretty much all of us has lost out on gratuities in situations where guests have asked whether they can leave a tip on the card; where we are now force to say no, because it is impossible.

over the last year i slowly saw him deteriorate. the denial and memory loss was the worst part. i'm talking this guy would forget what happened at the bar yesterday or even regular's names he drank with everyday at the bar. it was pretty crazy to watch over time and horribly sad.  

when i first met him five years ago he would drink beer and maybe a shot here and there before finally moving to wild turkey 101...we banned it because of the alcoholics drinking it so fast and going through that inventory quickly....at the end he would drank tanquray double shots with water /cranberry chaser and after three or four of those in a night and multiple visits to his vehicle (we all knew he kept another bottle in his truck) at the end of the night he was still standing and talking with everyone like it was nothing.   

i knew though. 

he would bring in all types of gadgets especially his tablet and watch movies or the news on his tablet and almost every night he would forget huge items you just don't forget often when you're seemingly fine at the end of the night. his wallet, cell phone, those mophie expensive cell phone chargers, hell he forgot a thousand dollar drone one night...thankfully we're all honest people and would always let him know the next day. 

this last month he dissapeared from my bar and his other favorite bar and completely shutdown. did not answer anyone's calls or anything. his housing edition was a maze and i couldnt recall how to get there to really check on him. a few months back he bought an ar 15 and he never really owned any guns but he always had knives and weird shit like ninja stars and blow guns he would carry on him or in his vehicle (yes he was definitely off) but when he bought such a serious gun people started to really become concerned so i was always afraid to check on him even if i did remember how to get to his house.

in the end idk if he died a miserably slow alcoholic related death or if he killed himself but i'm fairly certain he didn't have the guts to kill himself so i can't even imagine what his last month was like before finally dying by himself alone in his home. 6 months ago another of our regulars did the exact same thing. he was 64, dissapeared and was found dead in his home, hardcore alcoholic.

anyone know what type of end is in store for people who choose to cut themselves off and go that route? my morbid curiousity is extremely curious what exactly they go through and what happens when they finally die? is it typically during sleep?

first things first i am 100% going to miss this job. the people i worked with were the beyond excellent. some of the best people i’ll ever know. as i’m sure most of them people in this industry are. 

secondly. for the most part, people (the general public) are good. i’ve dealt with my fair share of cunts (as we all do) but as a whole when people come to the bar they are considerate, genuine and kind. 

finally, i think that working in some form of customer service industry (particularly hospitality) should be compulsory at some point in life. the levels of patience, attention to detail, communication and empathy that you develop in this industry are second to none.

i interviewed this past tuesday for a position at a soon to be opened bar in my city. the interview went well and i was asked to come in the next day (wednesday) for a two hour stage/tryout. the stage went well, i ended up working behind the bar for 5 hours instead of 2 which i took as a good sign. as i was leaving the gm of the restaurant the stage was held at told me he thought i would be a great fit and had told the owner (who is doing the hiring) so. he also gave me a rundown on what to expect working with the company. it is now friday and i have not heard anything so i am considering sending a follow up. is this a good idea and how should i phrase it? i’m good with follow ups after an interview but i’ve never written one after a stage so any advice is welcomed and appreciated. thanks!",Tompkins99,bar

172,"owner takes our tips....and pays for all walk outs, incorrect orders or miss poured drinks","i’ve recently started working for a restaurant in marlborough, nz and the tip system is f***ed up! 

there is a regular tip jar which gets around $200 a week (it’s a lot for nz) and when we first started it was emptied into ‘the safe’ as it was at $700 and had been emptied again 2 or three times over the 7 weeks. 

however when i asked i was told that at the end of the season the team gets taken out for a meal which is paid for with our tips. i kind of get this if the whole team wants to go for a meal but out of the 7 of us, we don’t! 

as the first few days go buy i’m informed if we miss pour a drink, any food is returned, we accidentally order the incorrect meal or most importantly a table walks out without paying the tips are used to pay for any of this!!!!

not only are our tips used but it’s put through at full price and not cost price! 

so all of our tips are completely hidden and according to last years seasonal staff, they didn’t receive a cent of their tips, just 2 free drinks at the bar after 10 months of work. 

we do see the manager with her hand in there a lot and wonder if the tips are just her bonus even though she’s barely on the floor and has the worst customer service! 

i wonder, does this happen to anyone else? is it legal? surely there is some legality to us being given our tips?

180,can bartender to server and back to bartender work out?,"last summer i decided to get into craft cocktail bartending and the hotel industry after bartending for six years, my last bar prior being a steakhouse. craft cocktails and fine dining are a newfound love of mine. i really want to get better and more experienced at what i do. unfortunately the hotel i work for is pretty toxic, we're losing people and i'm just not having a good time. i'm also moving to the the other coast later this year. 

there's a hotel chain with beautiful locations, amazing bars and the reputation for being a great place to work. everyone i know of that's gone there loves it and everyone seems genuine. they're opening up their seasonal rooftop biergarten and were hiring for servers and bartenders. the venue closes at the end of summer and would be a nice, natural end which is great timing for me. there's multiple locations in my future city and i think this could be a good way to get in. i really like this company.

turns out their current restaurant bartenders chose to go up and work there, and they have first dibs. the f&amp;b director and gm really like me and want to see if i'd be interested in serving instead just to join the team. they seem super willing to work with me and said the rooftop bar is supposed to be much more chill and lax in style, even when busy. they offered me to come in and do a little tour. i've only been a bartender and generally only do bar adjacent tables so this could be really good experience for me to get better in a positive environment.

my question is, if i use this serving job to get my foot in the door with this company will it hurt my chances of being considered for bartending gigs in the future? will they see 6 months of serving experience after 6 years of bartending and get all weird on me like i've forgotten how to do the job? i've had many bars try to push me to serving instead of bartending even when i didn't apply for it.  my passion atm is craft cocktails and settling down with a nice hotel chain but i'm willing to get my foot in the door with them by giving serving a try. i've nothing against serving in general, it's just not my thing. i tend to do better with massive crowds at my bar not table service.",VioletValkyrie,bar

however this may have to change, as today i’m on a trial shift after a successful interview for a salary based assistant manager role of a microbrewery, just outside of our city centre in a hipster-beer garden area with its own 11 taps served mere feet away from the stills. they serve spirits of course but i don’t think anyone really goes there for anything other than the beers or food (they have an indian food school-dinner-tray style business on the premise who provides all the food). the beers are reputable, in the interview they told me there was a lot of down time. some days only taking a modest amount of money. but they want to open a second site in the city centre in the next year, and the owners need someone to step up and run the basics of this place.

it’s the brain child of father-son brewers, the son who also manages the bar, so it’ll just be me and him working for five hours today. i’m worried if it’s as quiet as he made out it can be that i’ll have nothing to talk about. i don’t have the job yet, today is what he needs to see if i have the mettle. do i talk about my experience? do i talk about the beers? do i tell him i’m not an expert on beers and nowhere near a novice on beer brewing? i plan on asking a lot of questions but i’m not sure what avenue to go down. i’m a bit nervous and writing this down was more for my benefit, as i haven’t told anyone i’m doing this today, but any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",jackmosphere,bar

226,i need advice- i left bartending for another career but i’m looking to get back to my roots,"i started serving 11 years ago as my first full time job and was quickly moved up to bartending and then the dreaded management position. 

i enjoyed serving and then found i loved the creative freedom i had in bartending- also the learning aspect as i dedicated a year to studying wine under a sommelier. i travel often and working weekends was perfect as flights are cheapest beginning/ middle of the week. (i know it takes time to get to the good shifts at a new place no matter the experience i come with- i’d still be the newbie.)

i only ever left a position when i moved but every time it was the same story- i’d start off serving a bit/ mostly bartending and then was quickly thrown into management as i have experience and it always just kind of played out that way. 

a little over a year ago i was in the position of bartender/ gm of a wine bar, i wasn’t happy in the management position as i was making almost nothing but still having to bartend on my managing shifts as the owners kept hiring incompetent “friends of friends”. 

at this point i had a couple years experience in event coordinating through a couple different restaurants and one of my regulars offered me a full time corporate job as a director of events in my hometown. 

i interviewed and got the job and when i told the owners of the restaurant they were extremely happy for me but sad to see me go as they informed me they had just sold the restaurant and the women buying it was thrilled to have me on board (she had been in secret shopper style to check out the place she was buying ofc and i was the one she felt kept the place together) i helped for over a month on the nights and weekends i could but eventually the new owner continually rubbed me the wrong way until i officially left. 

it’s been a year in the new position and as much as i truly love planning and orchestrating the huge events i do the money isn’t anywhere as good as bartending (working for a not for profit) and the hours are not for me as well as the four person team i work in can get a bit hostile and it doesn’t subside after everyone is out of the weeds like i’m used to. 

i’m resigning at my position and hoping to get back into bartending asap. my concerns are getting polished and back on my game when it comes to mixology and what not as well as staying a bartender, not being moved to management at any point. i don’t want to be a key holder, i don’t want to even be a shift lead. i have reiterated this in the past when getting hired but every time it comes down to i see the restaurant needs it and i can’t bring myself to turn the other cheek when asked. 

any advice/ recommendations are appreciated as i get back into the swing of things. i’m mostly concerned my resume won’t be as appealing without the management credentials but i’m also worried once the hiring manager sees that it will always be in the back of their mind that it’s a possibility.

232,the wrong way to approach someone for a job.,"okay so yesterday the bar at the theater i work at got suprisingly busy. i was happy to finally get some more time behind the ubar and was finally get some more experience. this guy was getting some corona's, slammed one since he was late to his movie with his girl then took the next to his show. came back later and started asking me about getting another corona and also an application. he was asking me to use me as a reference on it. i said ""i don't really like giving myself out as an ref freely you know?"" he's wearing a hollister t shirt and was a total bro. he was all ""oh me neither man but i'm just looking for a job to keep busy!"" he gave me his life story, him and his mom got into an accident and got money from lawyering up or whatever. he ask for another drink but i cut him off cause he was into it. he then find one of my mangers and introduces himself, she then told me 1. make sure you cut him off, which yeah no doubt. 2. i don't want him working here. i agreed, man this guy wasn't smart. you try drink over our limit that we told we told you about, try and coax a complete stranger as a reference,  and drunkinly talk to a manager about a job (great first impression dude). but hey a monday night not on a bar shift i made $29 in tips makes me look forward to my first actual shift this sunday!

once asked where our bottle of “long island mix” is cause i guess i guess they make pre-made versions? she didn’t even know there was a different way to make it. 

i asked a girl if she was able to free pour with out a jigger and she said oh yeah definitely i’ve always done it like that. i asked if i could pour test her so that i’d feel comfortable letting her making drinks that were being served. her confidence faltered and she said she hadn’t done a pour test in years....and her pours were wayyyy tf off. and when she pours, she kinda slaps the bottle with her hand and swings it like a pendulum before pouring. 

they all fill the wine glasses up damn near to the top. i even made a mark on the wall to hold the glass next to as a “cheat sheet” of how full to pour them. 

i guess the part that bothers me the most is how they all say they have so much experience but then don’t know how to garnish a margarita.

i never told anybody i did this. it was my personal amusement. i made the mistake of telling the staff a small petty act of revenge on shitty customers. maybe 2 people out of the 1000+ that come in on 3/17. i think about 100 people have green mouths today. they went overboard last night, and so many people have green mouths today. i was dying laughing after last call, when we turned on the lights, and 25% of the people had stained everything, lips, tongue, teeth.",tour79,bar

i had to pull a 17 hour clopenning shift today running on 3 hrs of sleep (left work at 4 am the night before and had trouble falling asleep once i got home). it was a little rough at times but working with a kick ass staff who were all equally exhausted and all intent on a positive outcome made it so much easier to handle.  

also taking the phone off the hook after our (no exaggeration) tenth call in an hour asking, “are you open today?” or “are you serving corned beef and cabbage??” — i work at an irish pub. we serve corned beef and cabbage every single day on both our lunch and dinner menus. why on earth would we take it off the menu for one day (our kitchen staff spends almost an entire week prepping corned beef for basically this one event) and why on earth would we close on our biggest sales day of the entire year

we all had a couple good laughs during our shift about those calls. 


here’s to my fellow bartenders who survived this holiday as well. celebrate how much ass we kicked, the speed at which we poured drinks, and the money that made it all worth it.

257,do you ever regret becoming a bartender?,"i've been bartending in a busy downtown restaurant for about 7 months now and just got my ass handed to me this past week for a super busy festival that goes on for two weeks straight.  it was constant 400+ person cover nights and i got thrown into a lot of closing shifts and the late nights and stress drinking have led to some bad decisions.  i'm pretty sore from everything too and we are just going in to the busy season.  

it has been great money but i've been a server for the past five years at the same restaurant and still made good money and the stress was so much less.  it's probably bad that multiple people in my life have told me they're worried bartending will ruin my personality.  i'm usually pretty upbeat and happy-go-lucky but i've definitely noticed myself becoming more cynical and self destructive.  i tend to notice myself not wanting to interact with people as much outside of work because i spend all day talking to so many strangers that i'm burned out on conversation.

the responsibility compared to serving has been stressful as fuck, where i'm now responsible for liquor orders and prepping batches and garnishes and juices and mixers and salts.  if servers get fucked up on shift i'm under the radar too for it.  i feel like i really can't ask to go back to just serving because of both pride/ego and because financially it would cost too much at this point. 

i think it was just the past festival that has me regretting bartending, i really enjoy making drinks and constantly learning about alcohol and it's history and usually i do enjoy talking to people.  i feel like i have a lot more autonomy and potential at my job now too but it's come with a lot of extra costs.  do you ever feel the same and how do you push through it?  or do you not?",m1a1tanksauce,bar

2 a very meta second experience, the saddest and depressing fate, is the day i began to notice there are no originals. i think it’s around 5-6,000 hrs, maybe more, when you just become nauseous; that you met this same exact person with the same exact problems in a different meat package/poop bag and your reality shatters. at least mine did.  

no one believes that you’ve heard every story possible and every combination possible, exaggerating a bit. but it’s very likely you have the solutions from the last person who you watched solve their own issues, yet, people want to be originals and won’t believe you know what you are talking about. 

it’s almost like people want to suffer and want you to suffer more.

so i am lead bartender at a hotel bar, we have a huge pool so every summer (lets be real, it’s southern california so summer starts now) we have pool parties that are open to the public. any given day we can have 100-200 people out there. the bar is adjacent to the pool, i have 15 stools at my bar and the restaurant can seat 45 people inside, 20 outside. we get busy by the pool nearly every day, but especially when we have the pool parties on the weekends.

my question and request is this, our restaurant manager was recently let go and i have been tasked with making two new cocktail menus! i have contributed to bar menus in the past but not 2 completely new ones. i am really excited about this, but it is daunting because there is a ton riding on this. the drinks need to be refreshing &amp; light, we are a boutique hotel that was built in the 40’s so in the past my drinks have been a bit cheeky with word play and classic cocktails updated. what would you appreciate drinking in a pool party atmosphere that i can get out quickly in my service well? i really don’t want my ticket times running slow for the pool when we have a full bar and restaurant (same bar makes all the drinks for both inside and pool). 

after i assemble the menus i want to see about batching! what has worked for you in the past? lime and agave mix?

296,one tab wonder,"i had two couples come in. the first couple insisted i put the entire drink order on their tab. okay cool. i bring out a second drink order and ask if the second couple will be starting a tab. no put everything on one tab. i gently clarify probably 3 times during two hours of bringing them food, drinks etc. that everyone was on the same tab. then at the end they want me to split it up with everything they both had. now if they'd all been drinking different things this wouldve been okay but three out of four drank the same beer. after two hours and handling over 100 customers how am i supposed to remember how many beers each of you had. i know i have a good memory but i'm sorry i'm not that good.

299,"today i left the first place i've ever bartended at, it was hard.","it's been two years now since i started as a bartender at a country club in my growing coastal town. i was originally supposed to become a bartender at this sushi place i was working at. i was their head server and had just turned 21. wanted to ""expand my horizons"". was scheduled to start the following day when my manager told me that the owners didn't want me to bartend. they gave it to their neighbor who had just started there as a server i trained. i realized i had given alot of my time to the establishment to be held back like this. so i didn't know where i was going next but i gave him my notice on the spot. when i had left that day i received a phone call from a former coworker. he had been brought on to be the gm at this golf course and he said that he heard what happened and he wanted to give me the opportunity to be a bartender. so i did. i quit the sushi place and started at the country club. it was a new place in the making at a location where previous places weren't so successful. but this is where i started my experience. i loved it. i eventually became the bar manager and assistant gm. i had been given so many opportunities here. and i've met so many great people that i've cherished and cared about. in the two years that i've been there i've worked at two other bars. but nothing will match the kind of connection i made with that country club. it was my bar. i received so many thank yous and so many people told me how much they'll miss me. i'm a grown man but all the love brought a tear to my eye. but the show must go on. going into the city to make some better cash for the upcoming season. this day made me realize that bartending is something i love doing. i love making these connections with people. seeing familiar faces and knowing their beverage of choice sometimes even without knowing their name. my love of this occupation molded me into a good leader, great teammate, and awesome bartender. so today was a hard day but it was only the beginning of some great adventures to come. i'll miss my people and i'm glad they'll miss me too.",GoldenGangsta66,bar

302,tips talk - what is the setup at your place,"ok im always curious where people work and how much they make and whats their setup?

do you work at a restaurant? bar? night club?what hours do you work, how much are your sales, what do you generally make? do you get tipped out from servers? what %?

i work at a restaurant with about 65-70 seats inside, 12 bar seats, and 22 seats outside. the bartenders tip out 1% of their food sales to the kitchen (just something as the kitchen manager wanted more tips of course), and the servers tip out 1.5% of their total sales to the bartenders.  


sales for the establishment are about 2/3 food and 1/3 booze to give another idea. mix of wine, beer and cocktails.

&amp;#x200b;

bartenders work alone sunday - thursday and in a team of two on fridays and saturdays.

i don't do the bar shift enough to know consistently what they make, or know what they walk away with, but i'm assuming at least 150/each on weekends and 100-200 during the week.

our shifts run from 5pm - midnight (including close) or 4pm-10/11pm &amp; 7pm - 1am (including close) so about 7hrs\~",AngryJawa,bar

it turns out this bar is closely connected to some huge players in the cocktail world, and they want me for every weekend shift. now i'm thinking that i was just hit with a gift and i wasn't even asking for one. i'm in my late 20's and the luster of speed bartending disappeared the second i got an inside look of being behind a real cocktail bar.

while i am considering moving to another metropolitan area, i am concerned about not having a similar experience elsewhere. i just simply find it fun. i enjoy all the patrons would are picky about guinness pours and want to talk about when they ate fish across seas.

the area i am considering has about 8 irish/english themed pubs within a hours drive.

could anyone with multiple irish pub experience give me any tips as to stay in the themed pubs without coming off as obsessive to the shamrock as i feel?

how are some of the pubs different from each other?

based on two particular businesses i’d like to apply in the near future; one irish pub appears more high end and takes reservations and has a huge capacity and their bartenders appear to wear ties in their website video while the other is a soccer club home base style irish pub that also holds a larger capacity than i am used too but seems a bit more relaxed; and as i bartend for my local soccer club, i feel i could specifically get a personal recommendation from themselves.

373,how do you manage anger and frustration when dealing with guests?,"i switched to bartending for my hotelbar just a few weeks ago. over the past three years i've gotten a lot of experience working with/for guests, either at the hotel reception or restaurant. it is sadly normal that once in a while you encounter some douche guests and have to bite your tongue because reacting might get you into trouble even if you're right. over and over i've resorted to deep breathing and keep working. last night however, someone crossed the line.

&amp;#x200b;

two days ago an old lady came into the bar and ordered a gin tonic (tanqueray), which i served in a proper balloon/tanqueray glass. (yes, i know that depending on the gin you might wanna use either a highball glass or a balloon glass). once i brought the drink to the lady, she freaked out and started screaming ""wtf, what kind of glass is that? i've never, ever in my life had a gin tonic like this!!!1"" (note: germans will usually say it is the first time in their lifes experiencing something if they don't like it). oh man, here we go. the day had been kind of stressful so i whispered ""well, maybe you haven't drunk so many gin tonics in your life"". she wanted to give it back to get another glass and approached my colleague complaining. when he explained to her that the glass was indeed a a proper gin glass for tanqueray, she asked to get the gin back.

&amp;#x200b;

half an hour later she asked for the bill. she had drunk the whole gin tonic and i politely asked ""well, it wasn't so bad, was it?""- ""no it was actually not good at all!""-""but you sipped up to the last drop"" - ""it doesn't matter, it was not good!""

&amp;#x200b;

yesterday she came back with a friend of hers, and old guy flirting with her. a they sat by the counter she screamed ""can i get a gin tonic in a proper glass today or what?"" and the old guy screamed as well ""you guys serve gin tonics in flower vases!!11 unbelievable! never seen something like this in my life"" i just couldn't help but laughing but i thought ""hell with it, i'm not gonna let this old lady think i don't have a clue about what i'm doing"". so i went to her with my phone: ""listen dear lady, i wanted to show you something"" and googled ""gin tonic glass"". 9 out of 10 pictures showed indeed the balloon glass from the day before.

&amp;#x200b;

she then started to turn red and said ""yeah well, you don't get those glasses in good hotels (i work at a 5 stars hotel but still). as i started to explain the reasons to use that kind of glass she said ""you know what? i don't want to have that explained by you"" and she pushed me. like, she physically attacked me. she completely got me out of my zone. it had been a great day for the most part, we got very good tips and the guests were happy with their cocktails and drinks. but just one little episode ruined my day.

&amp;#x200b;

i didn't say anything or reacted in any way. just shut my mouth and walked back behind the counter. in my company, direct complaints from guests can very well get you on a meeting with the managing director and you don't want that. i know it wasn't probably worth to kind of argue with somebody who obviously doesn't have a clue. but hell, we are all humans full of feelings. i'm sure many of you have been to similar or even worse situations. how did you deal with it? how do you manage to keep working like nothing happened?

384,last nights shift and closing was the best i ever had,"i work at a small restaurant and during winter, we normally make around ~ 1500 - 2000€ a day. yesterday it looked like we can reach 3500€. 
the owner told us, if we reach it, we should stay after closing and every drink is on her. at the end of the day we had made a little bit over 3900€. that's the kind of number we reached last year during summer, when the terrace was open. you can probably imagine, how awesome we all feld, when we saw the final revenues.

so instead of closing down and going home, everyone stayed, the kitchen staff, the waiters and waitresses and of course me. the owner came in at midnight and we sat at the bar, drank beer and had a lot of shots. my wife came by  after work. we danced, drank more and laughed like we never did before. 
slowly the guys and girls went home and in the end my wife, the owner and i stayed behind till 5 in the morning. 

the owner told us, how she smuggled cars to eastern europe to finance her studys, how she worked in japan and later as a nurse and how she ended up with the restaurant.  how she and our cook where beaten up from the husband of an ex-waitress for firing her. how she got back after this and started to train selfdefense. shes a aikido black belt now. my respect for her grew a thousend times last night.

this will probably be the best closing i had and will have. and one of the best memories i can keep from being a bartender.

385,it finally happened to me.,"we've all read the posts, it's almost a cliché at this point. ""it was busy and then some idiot orders a ramos gin fizz"". 

whatever.

old news.

nobody *actually* does that right?

right?!

well it finally happened to me for the first time, but first, a little backstory.

saturday, march 9th, 9:00 am. i am at work prepping for a brunch shift. i'm squeezing 6 quarts of orange juice, pre-fixing bloody mary garnishes, as well as doing regular bar prep. for good measure, i go ahead and set up both wells. saturday brunches are usually nowhere near as busy as sunday, so we typically run one bartender and everything goes great.

that was not the case. we had a much larger amount of foot traffic than we usually do, and the bar got hit *super hard*. 

i ran an eight seat bar, two 4-top tables in the bar area, and service well for a brunch with 180 covers.

now, the plan was to cut me at 3pm, i'd have lunch, and a break, and be back at 4pm to do dinner service. that did not happen, service did not die down enough for me to have a break until 4:15. my manager watched the bar and comped my food so i could have a break then. the closing bartender was not available to come in until 6pm.

i was about a third way into a gorgeous lamb chop, when a server colleague says, ""hey, there's a group of around 40 about to walk in."" 

no.

fucking.

way.

i thought he was kidding at first, until someone tells me a bus just pulled up. it was actually about 60 people.

i make the most unattractive sounds conceivable trying to consume my lunch as quickly as i can.

these people didn't have a reservation, they didn't call, they just thought, ""yeah, this seems like a good place to have some drinks"". 

the bar gets slammed. a server with bar experience, my manager, and myself are all making drinks and starting tabs while another server is fielding orders for this group of 60 that all walked into the place at once.

that's when it happened. 

""can you make a ramos gin fizz?""

i was in disbelief. i've heard of this happening, but for a brief moment i just stood there and looked at her, and for a moment i was tempted to reprimand her for even suggesting it. 

i told her it would be a minute, got a few more drinks for some other patrons and let my team i was gonna be occupied for a bit.

i made the drink, got a lot of ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" from people who'd never seen one, and carried on with my life. 

a short while later, my closer arrives, and most people start closing tabs and are talking about where they'd like to go next. the feeling that i've reached the end and can finally slow down a bit is soon overshadowed by a darker one.....          

.......now i have to work dinner service. 

once again, a very busy shift. 175 covers.

those 2 shifts felt like 3.

but at least the money was good.

in a way, it feels like a rite of passage. does this mean i'm in a club now?

tl:dr, busy brunch followed by walk in party of 60 for cocktails and someone orders a ramos gin fizz, followed by a busy dinner service.",Mcsonofabitch,bar

to me these measurements seem huge to me with 90ml of ""alcohol"". other examples that i've tried to scale according to what i know seem to be short of sugar(sweetener), citrus and other modifiers. are the drink generally just bigger and therefore the same relative strength or are these drinks much stronger.

she goes, ""bullshit"" (🤔ok?)
me, ""you asked for it &amp; i brought it down that night. if you want you can search my room, i really dont have it""

i even go through my bag in front of her but she will not accept the fact that i don't have it. she even locked me out later that night &amp; then pops her head through the door &amp; goes, ""where's my bible?"" 

so she's not happy. and after a few days of this she eventually says, 
""you probably either lost it or still have it. either way i am legally inclined to not tip you out at the end of your shift so until i get that back im not doing so.""

now i understand that regardless of whatever the fuck happened to it, she doesnt have one now so i told her i'd buy her a new one but i don't have it so that's literally the most that i can do. and she tells me,

398,opinion: do you keep credit cards behind the bar?,"help everyone! i’m hoping for some direction regarding credit cards. 

i work at a local bar and grill with high volumes on the weekends and late night. we recently switched from micros to aloha. as of now, we keep credit cards whenever a customer starts a tab. it was policy for years because in the past they operated from one register (now upgraded to two), micros wasn’t the most reliable system, and we had to manually enter in names for every tab started. there was also the incentive for people to come and close their tabs.

however, aloha you just swipe it and it preloads all of the information for the tab. i see that with this new system, keeping credit cards is unnecessary and antiquated. i’ve offered up the suggestion of no longer keeping cards with my coworkers and they all are of mixed opinion. those that dont agree with me think that it will be a higher chance of people disputing charges on their tabs, unsure of the legality of adding gratuities to tabs left overnight, and how the screen will be cluttered with open tabs. 

i personally see very little negative. we already add 20% gratuity to tabs leftover, and they can dispute charges whether we have their credit card or not.

401,am i the asshole? need advice please.,"so a little back story. i've been working in the industry 12 or so years now. i've been working in this current restaurant for 3 years. i started as a prep cook and worked my way up the chain, now i wear multiple hats in the restaurant, bartender / mod / beverage director (fancy way of saying i create the cocktails) / hell, i even expo on occasion still. i go to all the manager meetings and we just got a new operating system and i'm the only one who took the time to learn it.

but last night i was just a bartender. 

last night a food runner almost fought a bartender. during the peak of the dinner rush. 

this food runner has been working for the company for 3 or 4 months and still doesn't know the bar numbers. still asks where food goes every time. he doesn't make sure, if, for whatever reason the customer don't have silverware they get silverware or whatever. as i've seen, he's grabbed food from the boh and puts it to the foh, and that might be it. doesn't even help bus. from what i've seen he's not a team player.

apparently my senior bartender from last night, been with the company for 10+ years doing every job, also sees that. the food runner told that senior bartender that a server needs them, during the dinner rush. the bartender tells the food runner, if the server needs him they will have to come to him. food runner says what the fuck and the senior bartender tells him just to do his job. (probably a little passive aggressive like, idk) the food runner starts cussing him out right then and there and then threatens to fight him.

i've never seen anything like this at this restaurant, boh sure, but foh during dinner rush was surreal.

i'm pretty calm and try to deescalate the situation. the food runner goes back to the kitchen yelling ""fuck those guys"" to the both of us.

at this point i stop being calm. i tell the general manager that he has to send the food runner home. we're basically a family restaurant and everyone at the bar just heard the food runner try to fight the bartender. the general manager doesn't send him home. food runner stops running food to the bar for an hour until he calms down.

at this point both the senior bartender and i are shaking. my adrenaline is off the rails for an hour. same with my other bartender. what the fuck, this is a job, the kid just tried to instill violence and he's not getting sent home or even written up. 

so then i find out that some of the customers complained about the bartenders attitude directly after that. i relay all of this information in the group messenger that all the managers have and say ""i believe the food runner should have gotten sent home""

since the food runner wasn't very supportive and since i tip them out for being support staff, we tipped him out less. it was my choice. he was to get 8 dollars. we put 5 in an envelope and i told the mod that because of the situation earlier, we weren't going to tip him out fully.

so that was at like 6 or 7 last night. i worked until 230 (well 330 because fuck day light savings) and i get a text at 10 am from the general manager, the one who didn't send the violent associate home.

**me** ""look, i'll be in tomorrow and we will talk about it.""

**gm** ""we all see you're constantly moody and you will have the money you owe to him""
i just go silent until he hangs up the phone


i go in tomorrow anyway to make cocktails, i already messaged the owner of the restaurant so that she's there during the meeting the gm and i will be having. 

but i really don't think i've done anything wrong in this situation. which means i'm an asshole, right? i was actually in a pretty pleasant mood yesterday until that happened and i couldn't shake it off, probably showed to customers.

tldr: food runner yells at bartender. it starts to become a fight. i break it up. food runner stays on, does not get sent home. i don't tip him out fully.

am i a shit bag? maybe you can't tell you're just hearing it from my side. but waking up to a phone call with my job on the line from a angry gm wasn't what i was expecting.

[original] we have two levels in our bar, the upstairs is the cocktail bar and downstairs is the pub. we close the cocktail bar at 11pm and the pub at 2am on thursday’s. i was at home watching the live stream of the bar when i saw a guy wearing a hoodie magically appear in my back bar. he swoops up dalmore king alexander and devils share, mind you both bottles are pretty damn expensive. and i’m here just watching him take it cuz i know he’s gonna dip out and the cops won’t catch him. a few minutes later my employee calls me saying he thinks someone broke in upstairs cuz someone told him they saw two guys walk out with bottles. the funny part is they puked on their way out, guarantee you they tried chugging a bottle lmao. i describe the guy to my employee and he says check the cameras for downstairs because he’s pretty sure he was playing pool with his friend down there. surely enough, it was him. so we went ahead and looked for his receipt cuz he paid with a debit card and went ahead and added a $300 charge onto it. can’t wait till he calls the bar complaining about a random charge on his card. i’m gonna have him come down to the bar for his “refund”. this is gonna be epic.

415,worst interview experience...,"i was a little baffled by how shitty this interview was and now i know why they have a lot of shitty yelp reviews. it was an interview for a barback position at a fairly well known whisky bar, even my manager told me it's a great place, and had a decent whisky selection which they were ""known for"". i've also been there a couple of times. my main goal was to either get a job as a bartender or a barback who could get promoted into a bartender somewhere down the line.

i show up 15 minutes early for the interview and ask the bartenders there if the manager i was supposed to interview with was in. they told me that he usually doesn't come in by 8. so i was like okay maybe he didn't tell anyone about it and i come back 25 minutes later, which was 10 minutes past the interview time (nowhere to sit and the bar was packed). surprise surprise he's still not there and i ask again. no one has any idea where he is, and then he shows up 10 minutes after that, says ""sorry"" and we go into their ""office"". we talk for a little bit and i asked him what the chances are of getting promoted, and seemed like it wasn't going to happen, no big deal. then the host/server comes in and says ""i need your help, people are asking about tables and i don't know what to do"" or something. he proceeds to disappear for \~10 minutes and comes back. meanwhile i'm just standing at the end of the bar looking like an idiot waiting for him.

from my experience working in the restaurant/service industry for 5 years i've never had a shittier interview. i was there standing for 1 hour just to talk to the guy for 15 minutes. is this normal for bars? i've been to about 20 interviews for barback/bartender position and never once wasted so much time.",itsnotmeeee,bar

418,i think i caught the owner skimming,"i work at a small local dive in an affluent suburb. the owner is late 60s and clearly slipping mentally. i take over for her on wednesdays, which are my big money night. she routinely takes 45 minutes or more to close out her tabs, make her cash drop, and return the bank. when she returns the bank, i'm not able to count it, because i'm in the middle of my rush. this past wednesday, we were a little slower than usual, and i had the opportunity to do a full count. it's short, and i confront her about it. she says something along the lines of ""i didn't touch the bank, i only did my cash drop"" and blames it on the previous night's bartender. that night it just so happens that i leave with the most cash i've walked away with from there...by the exact amount that was missing from the bank. 

this woman is a neurotic cheapskate, always trying to get us to do unscrupulous shit like charge items like pizzas for a party to people's tabs when they didn't order them. i got home, and started thinking...this woman has tried to get me to do shady shit before... she always does her money count away from the sight of the camera...she (for some reason) places the bank in an area i can't easily reach during my rush. something's not passing the smell test here. 

this bar is dying. they do zero advertising, social media or otherwise. i love the regulars, but i'm not willing to stay there out of principle if i'm getting stolen from. i actually got offered a job at a fantasic craft beer bar today. i love the craft beer scene, and this bar has great management, is well run, plenty of clientele. i hate to leave (especially over something i can't prove)...but...

428,semantics in lcb rules/playing with fire,"let me preface in saying a new bar for employment has been found and i'm asking about this situation out of pure curiosity. 

2 other bartenders i was working with would routinely back up customers at the bar around 1:50am or whenever we did last call. 2am would roll around, 2:15, 2:20, and said back up drinks were still being served. they were paid for before 2 am but being served after. this is for your type r run of the mill liquor license facility.  when i first questioned serving patrons after 2am they pointed out (in their minds at least) that the lcb says ""no sales"" after 2am. that backing up customers and serving after 2am as long as the drink is paid for prior to 2am would hold water if the lcb would happen to ever be in there for a sting. now, this led to other issues. for instance, patrons sitting at the bar at 2:24am with full drinks and me having to explain they have 6 mins to drink up and get the fuck out but that's a whole other topic. 

so reddit, who is right here? would semantics be enough to play off the lcb in this situation? or are these people just stupid and playing with fire?",Sleipnirsdouble,bar

432,kicked out and banned a regular tonight.,"i’ve only been bartending about 6 months and knew eventually i’d have to cut someone off or ask someone to leave. that day was today.

let’s call him t. t likes to show up early, sometimes before opening and stay late. normally he is super friendly and just chugs his pbr. he usually tips a dollar a pour, buys beers for other patrons who keep him company, feed the juke box and recently he even picked up the tab for a younger couple, although he didn’t tip on it. t also carries oxygen with him and smokes like a chimney. out of breathe and making sucking sounds, usually he requests us to call him an ambulance once a week, and then refuses services and comes back tomorrow.

well t has been crossing the line all week. he has already been asked to leave twice this week for his actions and bothering folks. we let him back bc we had a soft spot for him, but he started changing this week. becoming mean and greedy, not paying for all his beers and becoming demanding of staff.

today was my slow shift where i enjoy conversation and tv with my patrons. i fold napkins all day as it gives me an excuse to turn on netflix and stare at the tv once a week.

t wasn’t making much sense today. he had 3 pbrs before i decided that i wasn’t going to continue to serve him bc of behavior. i was talking to a regular and he butted in the conversation just to tell me to shut up. i ignored him as i like to keep a positive attitude, not start scenes and thought he was confused. he also didn’t tip at all today, but needed help shoving $15 into the juke box and broke a $20 into singles to pass out to the homeless walking outside.

anyways, i notice he’s been on the patio quite sometime and i peek out the window and he’s sleeping. i rush out and sternly explain he already knows that is illegal and will be asked to leave. he brushes me off and moves around to another seat. 

i walk back into the bar and where he had been sitting, is a spilled container of marijuana, spread across my bar. i quickly clean it up and remove it from sight. he didn’t get it back.

10 mins later i walk outside and give him his last warning. he comes back into the bar, sits at a random table and looks at the tv. i resume my bar.

a few minutes go by and i walk a circle around t and his table and he is unscrewing the top off a personal bottle of vodka and swigging it in front of me!

“no. t you are done, you crossed the line and you need to get out right now.” he confesses how ‘sorry’ he is as he’s pushing his bottle towards his face. “stop t, stop right now, get up on your legs and walk out of the door right now.” i tell him he is not sorry as he is disrespecting me to my face right now! i tell him i do not want to hear it and to get up and leave. he stays sitting. i grab the phone 
and walk back over and said “if your don’t get out of my fucking bar right now you will have a police escort.” 

he says something and i said “i cannot hear you t, i am on the phone, remember that 911 only has 3 numbers to dial and not 7 so you should probably go sooner than later.”

i call the non emergency line, and explain i am a bartender and provide my address and i exclaim i need a patron removed from my premises. he walks up to me and begs me to hang up the phone. i keep talking to the officer until he gets the point and i give his description and t finally walks out.

the police never show bc he left while i was on the phone with them still.

i resume my bar. about an hour later at shift change, the bartender coming in exclaims how t is down at the other bar surrounded by cops.

i banned him today.

i didn’t shake or get nervous, i didn’t cry or turn red, i saw that bottle and that was the last straw of my being nice.

it shouldn’t have gotten that far, and now i know not to play games and you only get 1 chance now.

anyway, last night marge was in and chatting with us when her husband, ‘mark’, speeds into the car park, reverses into marges car at pretty high speed and then parks up. marge runs out to see what happened along with a few other patrons and return a few seconds later saying they’re going to call the police. i’m pretty stunned at this and thinking “maybe it was just an accident?” as i’ve never even seen this couple argue before. 

mark comes storming in now and starts yelling at his wife stuff like “you’re not going to call the police... you’ve stolen half a million pounds off of me... stupid b*tch” and similar other things. then when she tries to defend herself, he smacks her across the face. hard. 

he runs out after my other patrons berate him and i’m just completely shook at this, so i go to call my boss when the wife tells me not to. apparently, as their daughter works as a manager in a daycare, if anything pops up on her or her families criminal records then it could cost her her job. she simply sweeper up the broken glass from her rear lights, told everyone in the bar at the time (about 4 people) not to tell anyone as it would risk her daughters career, and then acted like nothing happened.

apparently the husband went back to work (he works about 3 hours away and is only back fortnightly) so the wife didn’t have to worry about anything and she also has her own house...? they’re a well off couple and i don’t know if her husband has the keys to that house or not.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

i've never been very good at dealing with the smell of shit. one whiff and i'm retching like nobody's business. last night was a test of my grit, determination and willingness to stand in someone's shit-cloud split up a fight.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm the am at a mid-level bar in town. we're absolutely not a dive, but we do have the cheapest beer around so that attracts exactly the kind of people you don't want. being the am, i'm left in charge of the show mid-week so it's up to me deal with the various ingrates that we attract.

&amp;#x200b;

so, my story begins when two regulars wander in and order their usual two pints of strongbow. now, these guys have an interesting dynamic in that one of them is disabled (known as r) and the other, as i later found out, is his full-time carer (known as b). i thought they were just drinking buddies.

&amp;#x200b;

after ordering their drinks they walk away from the bar, leaving money on the counter top. i decide i don't like the vibe they're giving off, they seem like they've had a few already, so i take the cash and keep the change to one side as 'stupid tax', just in case.

&amp;#x200b;

the disabled guy lets himself into the disabled toilets and closes the door at the exact moment that another customer (m) decides he actually really needs to use it himself. so he starts rattling the handle and banging on the door, already not cool. it's at this point i come from behind the bar and make a beeline for the commotion. too late.

&amp;#x200b;

as i approach, the door is kicked wide open and out comes r, his face contorted with rage. he looks like he's about to go super saiyan. standing toe to toe with m, it's the ali v liston of pissed old men.

&amp;#x200b;

r: *you made me shit myself*

m: *that's not my problem, i didn't know you were in there mate*

&amp;#x200b;

ding ding it's go time. like an overweight catwoman with hrt problems r pounces, scratching and spitting. he gets a few good scratches in, but myself and another get in the middle of it. by this time the shit-cloud is emanating pretty strong, and you can see the seepage down his trousers.

&amp;#x200b;

""you need *gag* to *gag* leave now, *gag*""

&amp;#x200b;

it's pretty difficult to be authoritative when chewing somebodies poo particles.

&amp;#x200b;

through a combination of luck and help from a couple of large customers, we get r out of the door while he's still screaming about panic attacks and shit. this is when b ambles up to the door, finally deciding that he needs to be involved.

&amp;#x200b;

b: *i've not got a phone, can you call him a taxi?*

&amp;#x200b;

""*what?* no, i'm not calling him a taxi, not that one would ever let him in the car in that condition anyway. you two need to leave, and you're both barred.""

&amp;#x200b;

b: *but i've just bought 3 pints!*

&amp;#x200b;

""yeah but your charge has just assaulted a customer and also soiled himself, so you're leaving without them.""

&amp;#x200b;

b: *i need to go get my stuff then*

&amp;#x200b;

""you're not going back in, i'll get someone to get it for you!""

&amp;#x200b;

cue the same argument in circles for five minutes or so until they eventually leave.

&amp;#x200b;

i return to the bar to find a long cue of people waiting silently to be served while my staff member is attending to m's wounds.

446,#boston new bartender: feedback,"cheo cheo cheoooo, 

here's a little story of my begining journey as a bartender: 

just got a gig after landing back in boston from miami a little under 2 months ago. 
nice family owned italian restaurant that seats roughly 150 people. 
at the time, i was in desperate need of a job. not many places were searching due to the slow season (january is crazy slow) and was blessed with an opportunity to bartend. 
i've bar-backed in miami night clubs, which is another total beast so i'm use to the high pressure a bar demands. 

now, ever since starting we've gone thru 4 bartenders which kinda makes me speculate that there's something up with the spot, then again it's my first time bartending. 
im constantly being gaslighted and undermined. mind you,  i've checked my ego several times to it doesn't effect my progress to learn. 

what blows is that there is a new bartender, who does service bar and is a rock star (pushes drinks, takes care of guest &amp; does the side work &amp; inventory) but my observation is that she's one of those who's always gaslighting me &amp; undermining me when something is done incorrect in there account. 

im going thru the trenches,  learning the ropes, but does any seasoned bartender have any pointers on dealing with this? 

appreciate any feedback!

453,the bar i work at is engaging in discriminatory policy.,"hey all.

i've been bartending at the same place for about three years. it's a decently high volume sports bar in a suburb of a major city. recently, the owner decided that male bartenders are no longer allowed to close together (as in, two males and no females). it was a strange policy to create because this already very rarely happens, mostly just if a male picks up a shift. there's only a handful of us. more than one male bartender lost a shift because of the policy change, which is money out of their pocket because shifts are hard to come by. you earn them by working hard and staying reliable.

now it's getting worse. when we cut down to less bartenders, it matters what gender everyone is. sometimes male bartenders get forced to leave, sometimes they are forced to stay later, based on their gender. the worst part is that the overwhelming majority of customers don't really care too much. some of them do, but it's mostly the old man happy hour crowd and not the younger customers who come in later and on weekends. when the old men are around, there are always females still working because we usually start with 4-7 bartenders and cut down throughout the shift.

i feel personally disrespected and there's not much we can do. for sure if we stuck up for ourselves, we'd be fired. most of us are not in a position to flippantly change bartending jobs, especially because it means ""starting at the bottom"" again.

not really looking for advice so much as wanting to vent with other professionals. this bar already engages in multiple illegal practices like lying about hours to save on labor expense, forcing employees to pay walk-outs and now blatant gender discrimination. they were stupid enough to post their gender discriminating policy where it could be screenshotted and saved, so it's there if anyone wants to take legal action, but so far we're just suffering in silence. i know this sounds like a rathole of a place to work, but it's been my home for a long time and it would be tough to walk away from it.

i happen to suffer from pretty intense depression, so my brain is always looking for a way to tell me i'm less than a full person. it sucks when your job is going out of their way to tell you the same thing. i work as hard as everyone else and it makes me feel like nothing i do matters, i'm just a body and i'm expendable.

**tldr**; bar i work at is creating policies that only apply to male bartenders and it makes me feel like i don't have any value.",DefNotAShark,bar

458,industry to industry discount,"hey people,

i was looking to setup a ""card"" for people within our industry in our  town to share discounts which each other. this would be industry specific discounts - a way of encouraging people to use each others venues and create a sense of hospitality community. 

in a few towns/cities in the uk there is a sense of comradery, but not in this town. 

once this has been established - the idea would be to include other establishments who aren't directly hospitality establishments (gyms, tattooists, barbers) 

my question is, if this was a thing in your town, what perks do you wish you had that came with your job?

459,quit my bartending job and got another in less than 24 hours,"i had started working at this little wine place near my work in the city and i was enjoying it... despite the unorganization, confusion, the filth and lack of cleaning discipline and horrible scheduling tactics.

one particular night a few weeks ago, the manager texts me at 2 am on thursday and says “hey you’re working tomorrow at 6. remember we talked about this” 

funny thing, we never talked about it. not one conversation happened between us where he asked me to work that shift and i agreed. he had forgotten to change the schedule to accommodate someone’s request and then tried to pin it on me “forgetting” i worked. i even went in the next day to see if it was written in and i had just missed it. nope. it wasn’t changed at all. 

since then, the manager would text me (and only me) before my shifts to “confirm” that i was working. after this happened four or five times in the past two or three weeks, i told him it was unnecessary because as long as it was written on the schedule i would show up for my shift. 

he told me to stop acting butthurt and that it was annoying everyone at the restaurant and that he could text anyone about the schedule and shouldn’t get a snarky response. 

listen, buddy, i was a supervisor/a.m. at a restaurant and even if people were disrespectful to me i never talked to other employees like that. even if i didn’t particularly get along with them, i never would talk down to someone or assert my authority unnecessarily. 

welp, i quit right then and there and told him to not schedule me and i’m turning in my two weeks today.

it doesn’t matter because i just got offered another bartending gig for $10/hr plus tips in 24 hours.",vulpesxvulpes,bar
460,getting the good shifts: based on merit or seniority?,"i work at a neighborhood bar. i very much love my job and when i get better days the money is going to be fantastic. i currently work smf regularly. friday is very hit or miss at this bar depending on if an event is happening or not. the bar thrives on pool tournaments, karaoke, and concerts. concerts happen sometimes fridays, where as karaoke and pool happens on days i am not regularly schedule. 

one person who has been at the bar the longest gets both pool tournament days. anytime it is cancelled they put their shift up for grabs. they work another full time job and are trying to get out of the business so they don't like to put up with slow days. 

another person is out of town about forty percent of the time due to professional obligations. they get half of a pool tournament day, karaoke nights, and another off day. 

the reason i have stuck around this bar is because i get to cover shifts a pretty decent amount. i get the karaoke shifts most of the time when they're out of town along with half tournament days. i compared w 2 with this person and found they were making more money than me even when being out of town more and working much less hours. 

i think i have showed my stuff enough to talk to my owners about me getting in on those better shifts. they trust me, they know i am hungry for more and i am dependable. they have even talked to me about giving manager duties when the one owner buys their winter home (must be nice). 

bottom line: i don't think the coworker who goes out of town half of the time should be entitled to get their awesome saturday night and karaoke night shifts all of the time. i don't think it's fair and i know i am much valuable than i'm being treated. what do y'all think?",gsmit336,bar

466,writing down orders is a sign that you might be stealing?!,"new bar manager just told the staff the we should be memorizing all orders unless they are groups of 6 or more because it makes us look more competent and effective. understandable so far, but then he leads into the fact that writing down our orders could be a sign that you are stealing from the company. he said he's not going to mention how that is done, but that many bar owners and managers understand this...?

i've been bartending and waiting tables for a decade.. i can't think of a single way that writing down your orders can equate to theft..

i write down the majority of my food orders and anything complicated in a form of short hand. i don't always refer to my notepad, because i have pretty good memory, it's more like an insurance so that i don't have to go back to the table if i get derailed by a patron or fellow employee and forget something before i can get the order into the pos. so now i feel like i'm in an awkward spot, i'm concerned to write down my orders which has been my system for years, not to mention the last year and a half at this establishment.

""it was in a wine glass with lemon..?""


my brain broke.

we have boxed wine.....two of them. ""house red"" and ""house white."" did she mean to say martini glass instead of wine? did she mean lime instead of lemon? was she even sure she was in this bar the week before?! i tried to ask clarifying questions, but she didn't understand that much english.

we stared at each other for many long seconds, hoping the other would suddenly be fluent in the other's native tongue. my last-ditch guess:


""......margarita?""


she suddenly smacked both her hands on the table and shouted the word back in my face. relief washed over both of us. i tried to ask if she wanted salt on the rim, but our mutual understanding of the english language ended there.


we salted the rim anyway. and she was very happy with her lemon wine.",kea5223,bar

i’ve been bartending at my job for 7 years, i love my place of work and feel lucky to be employed here. 

we’re an iconic music venue with a “restaurant” attached. open 7 days a week. now we’re located in an area that has a large amount of homeless humans and drug traffic. so naturally our range of regulars is very interesting. 

on this particular day i was working happy hour, and had several friends and regulars hanging out. 

in walks “bob” for his shot of jameson. i serve him and cash him out like normal and move on. bob notices a table of what i’m assuming are his coworkers, so he sits down to chit chat with them. 

5 minutes later i go to cash out this table, and as i’m dropping the checks i thank them and tell them it was great to see everyone. bob smiles at me and asks; “can i slap your backside!?” 

wtf bob!? you stupid creepy weirdo! i respond;

“absolutely not! if you ever touch me inappropriately i will 86 you on the spot”

 whole table goes silent, i walk away feeling extremely grossed out and pissed. bob heads to the bathroom while the rest of the table gets up and leaves. bob comes back out and walks back up to the bar, i ignore him for a couple minutes and he decides to leave. 

no apology, he just dips. i now hate bob.

hi guys, so i recently took up a second bartending job at a pub/tavern and they have the absolute bare minimum as far as cocktails. no specialty cocktails at all and their highest shelf tequila is jose cuervo if that puts things into perspective. they have recipe cards for every drink that the owner prefers we follow exactly.
their old fashioned recipe reads as this:
pour half a sweetener packet into a glass,
add 10 drops of angostura bitters,
add a splash of soda,
in another glass pour a very large shot of jim beam,
pour bitters/soda mixture over beam,
add cherry and orange slice for garnish

557,need to vent - made $5 bartending a private party,"so as the title says, i just need a place to vent right now, i apologize in advance for the rambling nature this post will almost certainly take. 

quick bit of background, i bartend in a restaurant/bar in philly. i have known for a while that i need to move on as i am routinely frustrated by making half (or less) of what servers make, yet they have practically no side work and spend their shifts mostly on their phones and i spend the entirety of my shift busy washing glasses, cutting fruit, keeping the bar stocked and somehow the bartenders are also responsible for dealing with online orders (caviar, grubhub, etc.). i did feel some loyalty to the establishment as they hired me as a busser/barback with no restaurant experience, and 6 months later trained me to be a bartender. ""did"" is the key word in that last sentence though, especially after tonight.

our managers, while i like them individually as people, are almost comically incompetent, always focusing on the wrong things and very rarely actually out on the floor. i was scheduled from 4pm til closing (10pm), which is a standard night shift. except i was assigned to be working the entire second floor alone, with no server or support staff scheduled. (our schedule comes out saturday night for the following monday) i assumed we had a private party, which i eventually confirmed on my own. wednesday i worked the day shift and when i left at about 4pm, i asked the managers directly what was the situation with thursday (today). they forgot we had a party from 8pm til 10pm but they said don't come in at 4pm, come in at 6:30pm so i would have time to set up for the party. fine.

today i arrived at 6:35pm (punctuality is not one of my virtues) but i had the bar fully ready to serve guests by 7:15pm, as i expected the host of the party to arrive by 7:30pm to set up whatever decorations they might have. 8pm comes and goes and no one has arrived for the party. our kitchen, in a rare moment of competence, sends up the appetizers and pizzas that were prepaid for by the host. 8:15pm, still no one. i start to get that sinking feeling, either no one will show up for the party or they will come in late and ask us to stay open later to accommodate their lateness. 8:25pm, i have our hostess ask the manager for a contact number and she reaches out to the host. no answer, no way to leave a message. 5 minutes later she tries again, this time she reaches the host who says they will be there in about 10 minutes.

8:45pm rolls around and the first guests arrive. they all look like little kids and have clearly already been drinking. they immediately attack the food and ask if i can play their special playlist over our speakers. i call my manager who makes the music happen for them, and they are very happy. 

it's after 9pm when the first guests come to the bar for a drink. i checked everyone's id's and get them their beer and cider. no tip. not surprised. it's at least 20 minutes before the next brave soul comes to the bar to get anything. long story short i served exactly 9 alcoholic drinks between 9pm and 10pm, and received no tip on 5 of those drinks. one girl had a tab for 3 drinks, 2 pomegranate and lychee martinis and one whiskey sour, which she topped me $4 on, and one dude who tipped me a buck on his $9.75 manhattan.  i hate to bring race into the equation but after a year of bartending i understand why stereotypes exist, and the stereotypes did hold true tonight (prefer not to say what race most of the guests were tonight, but they were a minority known for not tipping, and also probably not your first reaction to that statement). 

so 10pm rolls around and i already have my bar mostly shut down, since practically no one was buying drinks it was quick and easy. i poured myself a couple drinks towards the end of the night to make up for the money i wasn't making and had all the guests out of my by 10:30pm. i was especially pissed since i normally work both friday and saturday nights but i had one of them taken away this week in exchange for working this party.

i have already begun exploring other opportunities so you don't need to tell me how badly i need another job. for reference, all of our servers have been at the restaurant for several years at the minimum (but we have one who has been there literally since it opened) since they make a ton of money and are expected to do next to nothing. on the flip side, i have become the most full-time bartender we have and i became a bartender janurary of 2018, since bartenders make shit and are expected to do so much more work than servers. sorry again for my ramblings, i started drinking before that stupid party was even over and i am finishing this post from my favorite local bar. thanks for reading if you made it this far.

560,"""give me your best cocktail"" responses","i'm assuming i'm not the only one who has or does work at a place known for good cocktails. with great frequency we get people coming in to try the place out and measure it up against other places (which is a different absurdity of a happening i'll rant about another time) and often ask 'whats your best cocktail' or 'make me something off menu that's your best'. i typically just respond by asking ""what do you like?"" as i feel that's the best approach, because i'll certainly never just randomly start making a cocktail for a person who just sat down and the only thing i know about them to be true is that they have an inherent misunderstand of how this industry, personal flavor profiles, or even common sense work. my long winded answer is that there is no 'best cocktail' and that there will never be a cocktail that is 100% enjoyed by everybody. more so i don't know a single person who's reputation is staked entirely a single cocktail. making cocktails (and especially creating them if that's your role) is not something you make one and simply stop. there is no single cocktail that can summarize  a single person or concepts entire identity into a single glass. the 'best' cocktail is different for every person. however, i can't go into the long spiel with every person who orders that even if i had the time. i'm curious if there are any of you that also feel this way and have your own way of responding. let's not get started on people who ask if a cocktail is 'good'. is anybody expecting ""no you dip shit, its terrible, we only put that on the menu as a way to spot morons.""?",VirtuousVice,bar
561,salary/wage discussion,"sorry this is a long one, there is a tl;dr at the bottom.

i'm new to leadership/management, so i'm looking for people's opinions on what i kind of pay i should be asking for.

i was hired as a bartender, but have been somewhat promoted to bar manager. i use the word ""somewhat"" because from the start i told the owner i wasn't really interested in the position. that i am a laid back person who's used to being friends with everyone and i'm not good at the disciplinary side. that's fine with him, he can have me focus on the admin work and bar program. 

the only other management position is the sous chef for the kitchen. the owner runs everything else, though in my opinion it's too much for one person, things fall through the cracks unless i hound him repeatedly.

we also do tip pool, which is divided daily by the hours worked. i am only on tip pool for the time i am on the floor as a bartender. i track my hours as a bartender (on pool), and my hours doing extra ""admin"" stuff (""top up"" from the 5.5% tip out, usually works out to $100/week).

aside from working as a main bartender, i also:

   - do the scheduling and hiring for foh

   - do all the ordering for foh (beer, liquor, wine, pop, garnishes, take out &amp; delivery supplies, glassware, etc). 

    - track inventory (beer counts, etc.)

    - do the pricing for everything in the bar (and we have a collection of around 300 whiskeys alone)

    - train new staff

    - keep in contact with our different reps (beer, wine, delivery platforms, website people, etc). 

    - maintain the bar program

    - do all those minor things to make service run smoothly (printing menus, running pre-shift meetings, etc.)

    - am one of 2 people who can authorize voids, discounts, and autograt

    - may possibly be taking over processing servers' cashouts and doing the tip pool soon


i am the only person to do these things. if i don't then shit goes bad super fast. 

so i feel like i'm essentially being paid $2.80/hr more to do twice the work of any other front of house staff, while taking a hit on my tips. 

the owner has repeatedly told me how grateful he is for all the work i've been doing, and that i've been a major factor of the restaurant running successfully these past few hectic months.

i am paid $15/hr for all this work. 

i am located in canada, in a major city, where the regular minimum wage is $14/hr, and server minimum wage is $12.20/hr. it's also especially expensive here, for example a decent bachelor basement apartment just outside of the downtown core starts at $1200/month. our restaurant's average bill for two people (food and one drink each) is $80 (before tax and tip), so although we are small we aren't cheap. 

i'm at a boiling point seeing the other servers making close to what i make (when combining tips and pay) when all they do is come in work service, and require constant babysitting to do anything more like basic cleaning. 

there are definitely days i just want to cut my losses and find another job. but then i think of the fact there is little to no drama, the hours are good, money has been steady, i'm not expected to be all glammed up (heavy makeup, heels, and a little dress is not uncommon in this city), and there's the fact this looks good on my resume (but i'm only at the 6 month mark so far)...



tl;dr

i am the only management position for the front of house, as well as being a bartender. i am paid $15/hr where server minimum wage is $12.20. 

it works out to an extra $2.80 that i get for basically running the front of house, again, while working as a main bartender. 

we use tip pool, but i am off the pool when not bartending, though i do get a slight top up from the tip out.

i work for a high end restaurant, one of maybe three in my city.. so, as far as learning more about mixology, i don't have much of a choice to work elsewhere, i have also bartended for now 8 years and really do enjoy the high end restaurant work as well. but, the chef who is also co-owner is a major asshole. hes younger, 30s, and has zero respect for front of house staff. he thinks we are ""lower class"" and anyone could do our job. he screams at us if we ask about food tickets, even though he commonly looses them or ""accidentally"" throws them out, (yes he has thrown tickets out on purpose to make us look bad in front of guests)... i just ignore him since the executive chef works way harder, is much more present in the restaurant, and usually an absolute pleasure to work with.

anyways, on to the pith story. the chef came in with a few of his ""friends"", people he lets eat for free, and they order a round of cocktails. i make said cocktails and send them to the chefs table with the server. the chef has ordered a drink with has a lime garnish. no shit, he picks up the lime, looks as it, and tell the server, ""tell him, (executive chef), to cut me a proper lime, clearly the bartenders don't understand how to cut limes."" the executive then cuts a lime and removes the pith. when i was told this story i busted out laughing because of this subreddit. anyways, he never mentioned anything to me, just needed to show off his pretty limes to his rich friends i suppose, what a life.. but thank you guys for a good laugh in a very frustrating time! you have also helped me validate he really is a jerk. cheers!

574,"we're all done here, bye","99.9% of the time, my customers are really awesome. but tonight this woman came to my bar determined to be the .1%

she's looking through the menu while waiting in line and after i'm done ringing up the guy i was currently helping i asked her if she was ready.

""why are the drinks you're advertising not on the menu?"" 

more of a demand than a question. i tell her that those are the promotional drinks and we're only selling them for a few weeks. 

""i want want something strong and cheap. whatever drink those girls before me got.""

in my head i'm thinking the last two customers were both men, so i look through my receipts to try to find any clue as to what girls or what drink she's talking about.

""there were three girls and they had some pink drink.""

whenever somebody doesn't know what to order, i made a mix of vodka, amaretto, peach schnapps, sour, and cranberry. it usually goes over really well. i assume that's what she's talking about so i make it. now, this bar has a pretty high markup so i usually like to let people taste a drink if they don't know what they got themselves into, so they aren't paying for a drink they don't like. since i make most of my money off tips, i want to at least make sure i'm delivering a quality product.
i let her taste it.

""i don't taste any liquor. can you add a shot of tequila to this?""

i tell her that it's already a double and i'd basically have to charge the price of another full drink because of the wonky way our pos is set up (we can only sell liquor quantities for predetermined cocktails but we can change the mixers).

""well this tastes like a hangover. just give me a stone ipa.""

i swap the cocktail for a beer and ring her up. customers can leave a gratuity on the card reader after they charge it; they way this works is that they enter the amount they want to tip and then press enter, but they have to fill in dollars and cents. so if they want to leave one dollar, they have to press 1-0-0-enter. her total was $9.01, and i assume she was trying to round it to $10.

""why did you charge me $20?""

i look at my pos and the total is $9.01, but the chip reader says $19.11. i guess that she tried to put $10 as the total but when it didn't work, she typed it again and entered it as $10.10.

""miss, did you try to leave a gratuity to make your total $10?""

""no.""

""are you sure? because that would have made the total a lot higher.""

""i'm not leaving a tip.""

i reset the transaction and watch all the buttons she's pressing because she apparently needs her hand held through this process.

""good thing i caught that. or else i would have had to call your manager and tell them that *(looks for my nametag, which i don't wear for this exact reason)* you tried to scam me.""

at this point i'm pretty much over the whole thing, but she just won't stop talking.

""no, i'm not gonna tip on that. maybe if you made a better drink...""

in my head i'm just like i get it, you didn't like it.

""...but you made me kool-aid.""

at this point i didn't even want a tip, i just wanted her to go away. like lady i changed your drink already and fixed the error you made on the credit card machine. why are you still here, looking for things to complain about?

575,"i struggle with balancing long, deeper conversations with guests and tending the rest of the bar. can you give me some advice, please?","i’m not the loud bartender, i’m not the hilarious witty one, i’m just talkative, open, very sweet and occasionally funny,  will go a mile for my guests and  love talking to people in a meaningful way. 
often times this gets in the way- from the corner of my eye i’m aware that service bar is taking care of extra guests, or the glassware is piling up, but i have trouble removing myself from a conversation. 
of course, i wouldn’t do this when it’s slammed, since it’s obvious to the guest i’ll be busy, but other than that i’m having a hard time with this. 
what’s the balance here? i feel like i should be giving the best experience to all my guests, including making them feel at home. i’ve gained a lot of regulars from this, and i see it as good for business. it’s not for my personal enjoyment. my managers don’t though and i feel like my coworkers get annoyed sometimes.

579,i serve drinks...and clean up literal shit?,"ok, so i work in a u.k. pub behind the bar. this happened on my shift a few nights ago. my dad is the landlord, that’ll be important later.

i go out to the front of the pub for a cigarette, and this old guy (we’ll call him pooper) is parking up a mobility scooter outside of the door. 

so i’m like ‘are you coming in?’ before i light up, as we don’t have breaks, we just smoke when no drinks are to be served, and he says

 ‘no, i just need to go toilet, can you watch my scooter?’

yeah no problem pooper.

five mins later, i’m like ‘i can’t stay out here i’m working, what if he’s fell over oh my god’
so i shouted into the pub (full of regulars that are like my family)

‘can one of you lads help me’ and a guy called ribs comes out.

i asked him go and check in the bathroom to see if this guy is okay.

two minutes later, ribs stumbles out bright red and literally gagging and spluttering saying over and over 
‘there’s shit. it’s shit. everywhere’

and then pooper comes out like 
‘i did shit on the seat but i’ve cleaned it up’ and off he goes.

fast forward five minutes and i’m like it still stinks so i go to check it.

it’s the shit apocalypse.

it’s everywhere.

this guy had cleaned it off the seats by pushing the turd to the back of the seat. so there was load of smelly mushy shite pushed to the back of the seat bowl. there’s some on the  floor. everywhere is smeared with the brown residue of poopy’s phenomenal shit. 

so i’m like 

fuck i dont have bleach

it’s locked up, as we keep it in the bathrooms but we’ve had people steal stuff before, and my dad has the keys. dad’s in hospital.

so one of my regulars goes shopping and brings me a bottle of bleach and another says ‘i’ve got some gloves in my van’

next minute, he comes back with the gloves and he takes the bleach and braves the toilet.

comes back. the shit is no longer. bought him a drink for it.

582,rant about my everyday morning job duty,"every morning when i open the bar people come in from the breakfast stand across the hall and try to sit down and eat in the bar/lounge. i am constantly come out from behind the bar, walking over and politely telling people over and over again that i’m sorry we don’t allow food in the lounge/bar area and that just right outside the lounge/bar is a place specifically set up for eating. (this seating area is usually pack and my lounge/bar is usually empty at this time) 

most people don’t respond or even look at me they just grab all their food and leave.

some people say “why, it’s empty i’m here you don’t have one guest why can’t we eat in here” 

(idk buddy i don’t make the rules) maybe because most people are slobs and pad or i don’t want to clean up your food mess. 

but at least once a morning i get someone who gets so upset and won’t let it go. 

me- i’m sorry sir/ma’am we don’t allow food in the bar/lounge area. you are able to sit right outside the lounge anywhere on the black and white tile that’s the designated eating area. 

guest- “why?! it’s dead in here, what?! do i need to buy a drink from you to sit in here?! i bet if i buy a drink you’ll let us sit in here. 

me- no sir/ma’am there is a no food policy in this area. 

guest- “why?!” why can we eat in here! this is ridiculous, where are we supposed to eat?! 
this is bullshit, i’m not buying a drink from you just for spite or i get a dirty stare as they get their food together to leave. 

i deal with this all morning and now when it gets to this point i seriously just walk away. 

what part of no food don’t you understand i don’t make the freaking rules i’m just the bartender. 

i’ll let the ceos know the next time they invite me to a corporate meeting that you don’t like the no food policy! ugh it’s just so frustrating.

583,i was drugged.,"i’ve been a bartender for 5 years and i feel like this is going to be the end. 

one of my regulars was always a little off but never did anything wrong. he would visit me at other bars i worked at and he would hang around with other bartenders so i thought it was normal, he just had a weird demeanor. 

that changed on valentine’s day. he came in with a bouquet of 4 dozen roses and told me i was the only reason he kept going in life. he’s a retired cop and he’s just lonely, i thought. then he started showing up to every single shift i worked.  

i started working at a new job and had a couple shots as i usually do, and am allowed to do, and all of a sudden nothing. i don’t remember a single thing. 

i vaguely remember rolling around behind the bar on the floor which i would never do anywhere but definitely not behind the bar in a dingy dive bar. 

i didn’t complete a single one of my sidework tasks. i didn’t count out my register. the taxi driver, one of my local guys, told me the rest of it. the stalker called me a cab, “made sure i got home safe” (i think he was just trying to see where i lived), i crawled up my stairs, left my front door wide open threw up all over my landing, and woke my fiancé up screaming for help.

to say this has never happened to me in the history of my drinking career is a complete understatement. 

i called the other bartenders he used to hang out with and every single one of them had a similar experience and stopped talking to him, probably why he’s been around me more often. 

the place he did it to me at was a brand new job and i don’t know if i can face going back. i don’t know what happened but i’m going to talk to my boss today. 

i’m afraid to go back behind the bar. i’m afraid he’s still going to show up or get out of the stay away because of his former police position. 

my trust in bartending has completely diminished. i’ve been laying in bed sick for days and honestly afraid of any sound in my apartment that comes from outside my room.

621,dealing with a really toxic manager,"hey guys!
so i am writing today for some advice. i have been working at the same place for just over two years now and have loved my time here, the money has been good, and management *was* awesome, until we promoted this guy up to manager last fall. he didn’t have bartending experience and was a barback (odd, i know) and when he was promoted was also promoted to bartender. he takes full hours on the clock even though he goes and does “manager stuff” for long periods of time. he also breathes down all our necks to make sure our pours are “on” (everyone else has years of bartending experience to his months). he reported another bartender for “giving away free stuff” because she forgot to ring in one drink on an open tab that was an honest mistake and almost got her fired. we just got super hd cameras and recently found out he is most likely zooming in on our phones to read our text messages (we have seen the cameras be able to do this it’s pretty intense.) he doesn’t help clean the bar but still takes tipout for the time we all spend cleaning. he’s really unpleasant to everyone behind the bar and also tries to steal shifts and is trying to usurp the position of the actual gm. he’s also a serious creep that touches most of the female bartenders inappropriately and he does it in camera blind spots. really i could go on, but my point is, he sucks. no one trusts him and everyone is trying to fuck with him or get him fired. yesterday all the bartenders met up for lunch because it was someone’s last weekend here before a big move so we were celebrating and the entire conversation was spent talking about how we can get rid of this manager and it just felt so toxic and shitty. 

i have other constraints on my time (i’m a student) and this job is perfect because i make decent money (at least enough to live off of) have only two shifts a week and everything fits my schedule. i am very settled in, management likes me, it’s great. but i am really wondering if i should leave due to this toxicity. it definitely affects my non working hours that i really should be spending purely on school work. but i am feeling like if i switch bars it will just be different toxic problems and on top of that i will be dealing with adjusting to a new job. i could get a new job in the summer time to leave an adjustment period but that’s also our slow season so finding something is somewhat unlikely. has anyone else dealt with something like this? what did you do?",mixeddrinksandmakeup,bar

625,how do i increase staffing fairly?,"we're a neighborhood bar in our 4th year and we're seeing in increase in business. right now we have 4 bartenders who each will open on their own or close with a door guy. used to be we'd run $100/$150 an hour and bartenders would walk with about $100-$150 a shift in tips. we're starting to see hourly sales hitting $200/$300 and hour and bartenders are making close to $300 a shift. they're definitely hustling for it and while there are pops where customers may wait a little bit for a drink, they get the best customer service and never seem to mind. 

&amp;#x200b;

my thoughts as an owner is that if we had a second bartender on, we'd be able to sell more drinks and provide an even better customer experience because the bartenders can take turns hitting the floor to buss and chat with customers, maybe sell a shot or two. however, i know we have top shelf bartenders because of the money they take home. i'm kind of stuck trying to figure out not just what's best for the business, but what's also best for our crew. if we don't have a happy and motivated crew, the business will suffer. 

&amp;#x200b;

i've thought about increasing payroll for a bar back. but if we just add a bar back to shifts, that only frees up time from washing glasses and bussing the tables. a bar back doesn't get more alcohol across the bar. i'm leaning towards adding another bartender so we can sell more. if a shift usually earns $300 in tips. 2 bartenders should easily be able to increase business to $400 in tips so they split $200/$200.

631,one for my bartners with anxiety.,"this is a damn long one, and i’m sorry for the rant. but this one is for my bartners with anxiety. my brunch today sent me into a panic attack. 

i love brunch. we do a build-your-own-mimosa deal, and i pride myself on being able to crank out 30 different combos at a time for servers while serving the bar. i make my own bloody mary mix. we have a great cocktail list. our food is delicious. even when it’s not brunch, i love being three deep and pouring it up. bartending is something i love. today everything just seemed to fall apart for me. 

it was not nearly the busiest brunch i’ve worked, nor the most short staffed we’ve been during brunch, but something about it sent me into a panic attack once it was all over. 

we usually have a bartender (me) and two servers on for sunday, but one of those servers got switched to second shift to help with an event. so it was only me and one server for our restaurant (12 barstools, two bar tables, 12 table dining room, three table patio). once my bar seating filled up, i hollered to call in day off server, thinking she was on call, and not off completely with plans. liquor gods love her, she came in to help while on her way out of town. day off server came in, relieved the pressure, i helped picked up tables, and we made it through the shift. it didn’t help that this was the first sunny, not freezing/rainy day in a week, but we weren’t seriously overwhelmed. no wait times, no turning people away, just consistently turning tables. we just needed a third, got the third, and survived. 

in the aftermath of everything, i was finishing up washing glasses when i started realizing my blood pressure was up and i was starting to cry. i haven’t had a panic attack in months, but i still knew it was coming. my boyfriend’s family was hanging out on the patio, a couple of my friends were at the bar, and the second shift bartender was there and starting to take over. i had every intention to clock out, and start drinking with all of them. once i hit my last round of glassware to wash and polish, starting my sidework, and my check out, i knew i was about 5 minutes away from full on hyperventilating and bawling at the bar. i’ve never had a panic attack while working, i usually love being busy, so that added to my anxiety. 

thankfully second shift bartender picked up that i wasn’t okay, and let me just count down the till and leave. i apologized to my boyfriend’s family, my friends, and second shift bartender that i was leaving in the lurch to cover shift exchange side work. everyone was very sweet and very nice about it, and i got to sit in my car and panic and cry on the way home about it. 

and then i got the phone call. 

i had no call/no showed to my second shift at a different bar. in all the panic and adrenaline and tears over whatever had triggered this, i forgot i was supposed to work a second shift somewhere else. i immediately turned my car around, started heading for bar #2, freaking out even more. thankfully, the shift had been covered while i was en route, but naturally i owe a shift and an explanation. 

now i think my panic attack was triggered by me knowing i had a second shift, but not realizing it. sorry to vent to you all. ",scamp901,bar

on one hand it could be they are desperate for people and just need a body. but on the other hand it could be because they have a good training program they believe in. the staff seems happy, its casual upscale in a boujee area and seems like a clean place.

but still a little nervous to start serving since 85% of my exp is barbacking, bartending, and runner/expo. any thoughts?

634,anyone else doing perfect serve with red bull and how’s it working for ya?,"we just started doing perfect serve with red bull and luckily red bull things aren’t super popular at my bar but we do sell some.

basically what it is,

we sell cans of red bull for $5.

we used to do $2 upcharge to mix a spirit with red bull for each drink.

so with perfect serve, say they order vodka red bull, we charge them for the vodka and then for the $5 red bull but then they get what’s left in the can and it gets served along side the drink. 

(i know that it is common for people to order like this if they know they want more than one drink because it ends up being cheaper but this is the only way we are allowed to serve it now because of our contract with red bull)

for shots, it’s one can per 3 shots. so, if someone orders 4 vodka bombs, they get charged for 4 vodkas + 2 cans of red bull at $5/each. but they get the rest of the second can.

we just rolled this out and we haven’t sold many (any?) yet but i can already see the complaints rolling in for people getting charged an extra $3 if they just wanted one drink/shot.

the follow-up question is, when someone asks me to chill 4 shots of honey jack, for example, are they expecting it not to be diluted? this is my real question, that i'm probably going to have an issue finding answers for.

the reason i put that the bar is busy is because i typically don't have time to do much more, constant orders all night as it is a hybrid service bar/bar, and i don't have barbacks etc.

645,"according to a 21 year old uptown, sorority girl, i can’t make a vodka sprite","hey guys. some of y’all have probably seen me post a few stories before. this particular one took place yesterday. 

so, some context: i work in a very unique beer bar in dallas, somewhat close to a college. we are by no means a college bar. in fact we are a staple mark in dallas as one of the first bars of its kind in dallas 27 years ago. we do serve liquor, but it’s extremely limited. we’re not known for anything when it comes to mix drinks. we’re the kind of place you go to speak to a cicerone about beer, not a mixologist. okay, with that out of the way...

it’s about 4:30 in the afternoon on friday. i’m behind the bar by myself when a large group of people came in. luckily they were all one tab so it was as easy as ringing in the beers and serve. y’all know how those work.

enter, college girl. she orders a vodka sprite. nbd, it’s super easy to make. we have 2 ounce pours, too, so it’s a pretty decent drink.

i hand her the drink, she takes two sips and puts it back on the bar top and doesn’t touch it again. about ten minutes later she asks for another one. same thing. two sips and drops it.

we get a little bit busier so my manager jumps behind the bar to help out. instead of asking for another round from me, she flags her down.

“hi, hey, excuse me. uhm, can i have a vodka sprite? the tall bartender there doesn’t know how to make one”

confused, my manager asked me what that was about. i tell her she thinks there’s not enough vodka in her drink. so she makes the exact same thing as i do. hands it off to her. again, leaves it on the bar top after two sips. 

the next time she comes around, she explains it to my manager how she thinks there’s not enough vodka in the drink. my manager tells her that we actually have a 2 ounce pour, typically a half ounce more than any bar in the area. the girl then asks if she can order a double, so four ounces. manager explains that to her and the girl agrees.

a minute later she comes back and says “there’s to much vodka in this! how the fuck do y’all have a job here??!?”

she ordered a miller lit after that through my bartender that just arrived. i would have just told her to leave if she tried to order through me, but i was finished dealing with her.

yes,  i can make it for you.  i am *more than happy* to learn new recipes. something i love about my job is finding new recipes that i can add to my bible. but — but no, i won’t stand there and wait for you to *google the recipe real quick* on a busy friday night.

“go ahead and take a minute to find the recipe i’ll be back in a few”.  

“oh, what’s that? you and your friends all found tipsy bartender ™️ recipes? but you’re gonna spend another 5 minutes yelling back and forth to each other (motioning me to stay) because you came to the bar to order without knowing what you wanted?” 

“no. no, i can not light the shot on fire. i know he does — yea i’ll get my manager.”

*inhales peacefully*

why don’t you just tell me what kind of flavors you like, and we can find a cocktail you’ll enjoy?

anyone else hate the tipsy bartender in these situations? the guy that asked me for all those drinks prefaced it with “do you serve any any drinks that aren’t: sweet, sour, fruity, or bitter?” 

“a whiskey and water?”

and then ordered a *“liquid marijuana”*

3/4 oz. (22.5ml) spiced rum
3/4 oz. (22.5ml) melon liqueur
3/4 oz. (22.5ml) coconut rum

1 oz. (30ml) sweet &amp; sour
1 oz. ( 30ml) pineapple juice
garnish: marijuana leaf shaped pineapple slice)

**which is sweet sour and fruity** ffs.

i am going to just start making random drinks and saying “yes, that’s an afghan jesus juice...” 

also, wtf is the recipe you use for a sexy bartender? i had a guy come in tonight and say he knows there are 3 different recipes but for me to pick the best one. lol. i just made a fruity drink and smiled. just stare at my boobs and hand me your money.

i once had someone order a sexy bartender, and then get mad it was not an ugly bartender, because i should’ve known she wanted an ugly bartender but didn’t want to *offend me* so she ordered a sexy bartender expecting an ugly bartender. i. am. not. joking.

as i served him another beer i noticed one of his tattoos was darth vader. i thought was cool but then noticed next to it was a imperial gaurd. i told him i liked his dark side tattoos and showed him my star trek tattoo, he got defensive a bit about star trek vs star wars but then he and i nerded out hard core for about 20 minutes about star wars. i'm talking like books, movies, games and animated shows.

he then told me that none of his friends know about this stuff and he hadnt been able to talk to anyone about it for years. his wife came down and joined himand he then excitedly told her all about it and i could tell she was genuinly happy he'd connected with someone about that shit.

652,tipsy bartender and the underage host,"tl;dr: underage host tries to tell a seasoned bartender how she's an expert cause she watches tipsy bartender. 

all these recent posts about tipsy bartender reminded me of a host we had. luckily she sucked so hard that they fired her a while back, but she's the only person i've wanted to physically assault whenever she opened her mouth. 

so we get random bottles of liquor from our distributors that we like to make up drinks for. sometimes we decide to order the liquors permanently, or not. back when the newest predator movie came out, i had been planning on making a green drink. something with midori that anyone can drink. not too strong since we're a restaurant with a bar and not a bar that has food. my bar manager lets me know that we only have a little left of some dark rum or whatever it was and to use it up in a drink special for the day. no problem. 

i make this drink, give it a dumb name, and get to work. the host, who's not even 18, starts calling my name while i'm trying to take an order. the convo is forever etched into my mind. 

host: did you make the drink today?

me: yeah

host: weeelllll, you should have made something green for the new movie. 

okkkkkaaaayyyyy? me: we're trying to get rid of a certain liquor so i didn't. 

host: do you watch tipsy bartender? (cue my eye roll). i watch his videos all the time and make really good drinks. i made a drink with that green stuff. you know, the sweet one?

me: are you talking about midori?

host: is that what it's called? i make amazing drinks and my brother has me bartend his parties at our house. 

me: ...ok...

a few days later she leaves the host stand and comes to my bar. 

host: do you know how to make a graveyard?

me: no, but i can look it up. why?

host: it's a drink from tipsy bartender. 

(sweet baby jesus) me: i think i've actually seen that video. it's a twist on a long island or something.

host: no it's a graveyard. 

me: i get that, but it's got different liquors as it's base...like a long island. 

host: no...(off she goes)

first of all, fuck you for ordering that when we are clearly in the weeds. secondly, waving your card or cash in my face is a sure fire way to get me to ignore you. 

anyway, i finish with the guest i was currently helping, ring her up, take the second gentleman's order which turned out to be a large one. it took me about 6 minutes to finish those drinks, ring him up, etc. i start walking over to fratboy to help him and he once again leans over my bar and yells ""excuse me i have been waiting and you are ignoring me."" i took a step back and said ""sir, yelling at me is not the way to get me to help you faster."" he got upset and said they were going elsewhere, then made a big show of putting his card away and walking towards the exit.

662,being a nice bartender gets you nowhere.,"i apologize for my typing. doing this on my phone.

so to start off i will say i work at a small town bar, there are 3 bars in town and we all stay moderately busy. i'm the only bartender at my bar and we are the busiest bar in town because our rustic decor really attracts the older crowd. tonight (which is friday so plenty busy) i'm running around like crazy doing dishes making drinks, pouring 30 different shots for a table of girls on their girls night out. i'm already having a hard night since i literally work alone. as i said i'm the only bartender but i'm also my own bouncer, barback, manager, everything. so i dont have time to get a drink of water between pouring drinks all night and i'm always 3 drink orders behind. 

so after a long night of bullshit, in walks the asshole of the night. he obviously came from one of the other bars in town and slurring his speech like a drunk asshole. he orders a bv and water short on ice. easy enough, but i see he is drunk. but i decide he came here with friends and they were not as intoxicated so i serve him a drink (honestly probably light on the bv just to be sure.) and i watch him. in the time it takes him to finish his drink i see he is straight drunk. so i cut him off. i tell him calmly ""hey man, it's against the law for me to serve you, i can grab you some water or soda if you'd like?"" since he was with his friends i didn't want to give him nothing. and dude loses his mind, literally thinking i personally hate him and that he pissed me off. he just cannot control himself. i repeat ""it's not my choice."" i point to our sign that states the law, ""it's against the law man."" and leave it at that and walk away because i'm just done with this dude's attitude. so he goes back to his friends and i can very easily hear him talking shit about me, saying i'm easily upset and to watch out for me because i'll cut them all off and even calling me a liar. once again i chalk it off to him being drunk and dont let it get to me as i pour another 15 lemon drops for the girls table. 

about 30 mins later one of his friends walks up looking defeated and asked me why i cut his buddy off. i repeat myself like i did before. this guy understood and walked away. here comes the second friend who is one of my regulars and a fellow metal head. he sits down and asks me if i can pour them all a shot, just one and they will leave. he says ""i know you cut him off.... but just one shot okay?"" i roll my eyes and try to show i dont hate the guy i begrudgingly agree. ""but this is it"" i say. i pour 3 shots for the three and the guy yells to the bar ""i dont know who's shot this is, because i'm cut off!"" i stare him in the eyes and say ""it's yours."" and walk off to go grab someone a beer. behind me i hear him say ""what a stupid bartender. he cuts me off but serves me because someone else bought it."" i lost my cool there.... i walked over grabbed his shot and pulled it behind the bar. stared him down and used my rather large size to intimidate him and say ""leave."" so he looks at me all confused and wondering what i'm gonna do and says ""are you kicking me out now? what did i do?"" i reply angrily ""you pissed me off, and i'm done with your fucking mouth. dont make me tell you again, so choose a door."" he stands up and just asked me ""what did i do wrong? what did i do?"" at this point everyone is visibly annoyed by the guy. so i get out from behind the bar and use my role as bouncer as well and i pushed him at the door by his collar while he is just screaming every curse word in the book. 

it's done now, but damn does it annoy me that he sat there are called me stupid for trying to be nice to him. he bitches for half an hour about me cutting him off then gets snarky when i do what he wanted. i do find some joy in the fact that everyone got to watch me embarrass him by physically throwing him out.",rainbowbeard17,bar

707,what’s your take on freezing fruit juice?,"i’ve been tasked with streamlining prep and minimizing waste at a cocktail bar. i want to maintain “fresh squeezed juice” but don’t want bartenders to spend an hour each day juicing four types of citrus so i’m considering juicing a month’s supply at once and freezing to preserve it. my main worry is that it might compromise quality, but i don’t have any experience with frozen juice to compare.

by doing all of the prep at once we save time ($$$) by only setting up the juice station once a month instead of daily, orders of fruit can by used in their entirety (less spoilage, $$$), and generally it seems like much less of a pita.

pros: consolidate prep time, no ordering pasteurized juices, minimize fruit spoilage.

cons: it’s frozen...does this affect flavor or quality? if bartender hasn’t thawed out a backup, could cause 86 on key product.

he orders a cesar salad and a shirley temple... i'm fucking tickled at the contrast, but okay. i respect the dude. and i make the most respectable looking shirley temple i've ever seen. house made grenadine, large ice cubes, two luxardo cherries speared and laid across the top of a collins glass... classy as all get out. i plop it down in front of my guy and he seems pretty stoked. i go off to work on my next guest and hear the biker man pipe up to ask me if those cherries have booze in them. 

""they are brandied cherries, but the alchahol in them is so minimal i add them to kids drinks"". i made the mistake of saying to this guy.

"" i haven't had a drink in 3 fucking years and i just tasted booze in these fucking cherries!"" dude is getting livid. 

""seriously sir, it's far less than cough syrup, and if that is such a point of contention, let's avoid the grenadine too because we use a splash of vodka to preserve it... maybe i should just get you a sprite?"" 

""just get me a damn sprite""... at this point i think he started to realize how dumb he looked. he definitely made a scene and the rest of the bar put him in his place just by looking at him. if he went any further i would have probably asked him to leave. 

he was extremely quiet for the rest of his meal, ordered desert, tipped 20% and left. i have never been left with more questions about a guest in my life.

i’m mostly looking for suggestions and if you think the cost and time of aging is worth it when i’m the only one seeing it?

what kind of flavors do you think could be successful in execution/infusion and be paired with multiple drinks? a vanilla cherry for old fashioned and/or amaretto sour?

could this be done with other fruits for muddling even?

i would like to know if it’s possible for someone(introvert you could say) to become better at bartending.

i’m not talking about physical skill, or knowing how to make cocktails(i know this is really important but i already know one can become better at it with practice)
what i want to know is if there is any practice for someone to learn how to engage, how to create a connection with the customer, how to make their experience pleasant. i feel like people don’t talk about that enough. what i found so far just says “great bartenders has good customers service skills” or “has a good personality”, while that is true what i want to know is how do i become like that.

i actually did bartender for about 1 year, but i know i didn’t do a great job(but now i want to improve myself). i would just make the cocktail, serve it and find something else to do so i didn’t have to chat with the customer. 

i don’t engage mostly because i don’t want to bother people... i mean, if someone comes in alone, order and just sits there scrolling through their smartphone... i just think that they might not want to chat... 
so what’s the thin line between trying to create a connection and bothering someone?

733,starting in industry with solid “amateur” experience,"longer background below, but core question: what type of positions/bars to shoot for with a solid understanding &amp; appreciation of liquors and cocktails but only generic service industry experience? is experience creating menus, designing drinks, hosting (private) parties valuable or worth mentioning in an interview/to an owner or bartender while picking up an application or otherwise asking around for the job?

more background: husband and i have been living abroad (from the us) for many years, during which time my husband was precluded from working due to his visa status. we’re now moving back to the us, i’m heading to school, and he’s taking on breadwinning responsibilities, and wants to work at a bar.

while abroad and forced into unemployment, he has learned an immense deal about the “mixology” side of the craft. and i don’t mean to say he drank a lot and imply that means he learned a lot; he can make a mean cocktail, we’ve gone through a diverse range of liqueurs, he can deftly handle basic drinks and quite a few weird ones as well, and he does a good job at the “listening to the customer to figure out their taste and recommending the appropriate standard and/or crafting something new to taste” bit of it. we’ve churned through a few books not only about recipes or specific ingredients but the general art of bartending and bar running.

we have hosted a series of events as a way for him to pick up cash on the side, actually getting extended friends to pay for drinks at little bar nights we host; he hand crafts the menus, gets good balances of styles, classics, and drinks we’ve concocted ourselves, literally draws out and calligraphy ups individual menus for these events. he’s picked up some of the basic bar backing skills squeezing lemons in advance and keeping track of orders and what is in which shaker hosting up to 20 people.

so i know none of this is real bartending, don’t mean to infringe on y’alls more professional dedication to the art, but back to the core question: are any of these skills valuable for scooping up an entry level postition? he has no problem putting in his time, barbacking, doing whatever auxiliary jobs are available within the bar, doesn’t mind being at the bottom of the totem pole, but wants to be at the bottom of the totem pole at a speakeasy or craft or niche kind of place. 

and he also doesn’t want to harp on this stuff, walk in with a full portfolio or spout off about his own drinks, when this might miff the guy in charge and come off as uppity or “i don’t think you’ll be a good bareback if you’re preoccupied with putting your drink ideas in place” when as i said he has no qualms starting at the bottom.

760,some asshole decides to just come behind my bar,"tl;dr basically the title

i have to vent

yesterday i’m chatting up a regular and i look over and some asshole is yuckin it up with his buddies behind my bar.

we don’t have a service flap/gate type thing it’s just open and people like to congregate by there naturally for some reason.

my go to when dealing with assholes is public shaming so when i saw this guy behind my bar i yelled at him to the scathing degree that all his friends got quiet. i’d said something like “hey! absolutely not, back the fuck out”

his and his friends reactions were basically “woah chill out dude” which made me even angrier. i told him that there is a line that you do not cross and he seemed to not really respect what i was saying to him.

one of his friends bought a round of shots (me included) and i shook the morons hand and tried to keep the party going. i thought we had an understanding.

15 minutes later i look over and the same asshole is now even deeper behind the bar than he was before and i saw red.  i yelled even louder this time something like “hey dickhead what the fuck did i just tell you”
and he brushed it off like “yeah yeah yeah you’re freaking out” (which made me even angrier).

i tell him to put on his coat because i was going to close him out and i was kicking him out.

i turn to go get his tab and i can hear him go “are you serious? is he serious?” 

i have his tab and i’m walking over to give it to him and notice his foot right over the line where the bar area starts. you know, just to be a prick.

i walk right up to him, step on his foot and say “you’re leaving now”

from there he wants to argue and i’m not having it, his wife is a dumb bitch who tries to rationalize his behavior and i shut her down with “i’m not talking to you”

my gm comes up from the office (i’m the agm) with very little context (except earlier i texted him some dickhead was behind the bar) and immediately backs me up.

the assholes buddies grab him because now he wants to fight me and drag him toward the door where he yells across the room to me “you fucking faggot” so there you go.

his wife then says to my gm “your little bar is insignificant to us anyway” to which my boy goes “cool”.

epilogue: asshole left his credit card. my instinct would be to keep it and make him have to come in to get it. my gm had a better idea: he took it and ran out to them down the street. he calls out to them “hey bro!  ...you forgot your credit card. have a great night!”

762,so... who got bounced last night at yours?,"fucking saturdays. 

two girls came to the bar last night: one obviously over 30 and the other looked super young, so i id’d her.

her: “they just id’d me at the door!”  
me: “yeah and i’m id’ing you here too, i don’t control the door”.  
her: “well i don’t have id”  
me: “then you need to leave”  
them: “we work at the pub opposite, the bouncer is vouching with their security”

she goes and gets the bouncer who comes over, tells me he’s checking with that pub’s security but that they should know better than to come out with an obviously under 25 year old (she looked under 18 to me) with no id so don’t serve them until he comes back and verifies.

the girls then start yelling at me when i tell them i’m not serving either of them because the older one is obviously trying to order drinks for them both like she thinks i’m a fucking idiot who doesn’t remember that they both asked for the same drinks when they first came in.

turns out the bouncer went and asked security with the younger girl, and the manager came out and yelled at her for trying to get served at another pub without id and she’s barely 18. the manager at her work told our bouncer not to let her in!

the older woman was let back in in but because she tried it on with me didn’t get served all night and just stood at the bar waiting and giving me evil eyes. 

—

i also got two guys bounced because one guy came up and ordered the drinks, then it turns out the other guy who wasn’t at the bar was meant to pay and refused because the guy ordering ordered too much. i yelled at them to sort their drama out between themselves but that they need to fucking pay me. they then tried to shortchange me by saying “i’m only fucking paying a tenner” and walk off while calling me a bitch, so i told them it’s either pay for all of it or leave with none of it to which they suddenly had all the money needed and security saw them try to shortchange me and call me a bitch and had them leave after anyway.

25 minutes later the paramedics show up. she’s still laying slumped against the wall, and the paramedics check all of her vitals and sugar. they then tell us that she fine and there’s nothing they can do for her, so they left her laying in the floor. my coworker and i ended up having to help her friends carry her to the car.

772,i’ve noticed that people are getting progressively ruder,"as a barback, it became apparent to me a few years ago that there’s much less consideration for others in “your” personal space (e.g. leaning back into someone trying to get through, which has led to a trend of people just shoving their way through the crowd). it’s gotten progressively worse since then, to where i’ve even had to threaten to 43 someone for contentiously blocking access to the bar. i mean, if i can’t restock, nobody gets to drink. 

now with the ubiquity of smartphones, people are used to having instant gratification while also being completely involved in their own world. patience is at an all-time low. this culminates in the most pleasant of interactions at the bar. customers want to finish what they’re doing on their phones, and expect you to still be there to immediately take their order when they finish. so with that out of the way, about last night...

i was finishing up an order and turned to hear a woman somewhere around 40 years of age **screaming** at my barback. for anyone who had spent even 30 seconds paying attention, it’s obvious he’s not a bartender. he had just returned from the back with an empty trash bin and an armful of bottles. he was stocking backups when i heard her berating him.

**”are you kidding me? i *know* you can *fucking* hear me!”**

i ran over and put on my best principal voice. i pointed my finger at her and shouted back, **”hey! he’s not a bartender, and don’t you *ever* fucking talk to my staff that way! *he* doesn’t make drinks. *i do.*”**

the realization of her error was instantaneous. i was proud to show my for support the man who is essentially the boss’ right-hand man. but i can’t consider it a victory. it actually saddens me that i had to admonish this woman, especially when i then saw her join the group she came with, a group that i had mentally flagged as respectful and experienced based on earlier behavior.

so that’s my story, and the impetus for this post. now, r/bartenders, i’d like to hear your view on the issue. in which ways have you seen manners deteriorate in recent years? what are your “grow the fuck up” stories?",bluesox,bar
773,“i used to do what you do” /rant,"hey guys! 
not really sure what the point of this post is except to say what asshole this dude was, but here goes.

so last night, i was the only bartender in one of the bars for the first hour and a half. normal, but i was totally slammed between server tickets and my customers. so this dude comes up and orders b52 shots and i couldn’t really remember although i remembered you could use 151 so i said i don’t think we have all the stuff for those, but could you remind me what’s in them. 

he tells me “i used to do what you do” and that the shot is layered (i know this) and the ingredients and that i can use grandma as a sub. then he proceeds to tell me layering is where you take a spoon and... i cut him off there and said yes, i know what layering is. he also then proceeds to tell me i should check out the app mixology 101 to learn more drinks and i was like yeah i’m not gonna look up an app to memorize a bunch of shots we never make. i have made b52s maybe two other times in my over two years bartending at this bar. throughout this conversation i had maybe 10-15 more customers lining up behind him and 6 more server tickets popping up. proceed to make him two perfectly layered shots bc i still know wtf i’m doing even though we are not a bar that does a lot of fancy stuff, or really anything that takes a ton of time to make. i probably use my shaker cup on like 1% of orders, let alone anything layered. 

the dude also came back and ordered a capirinha! like we would have the stuff for that! my bar is a high volume bar in a college town, in the middle of a district of high volume bars and clubs, not a craft cocktail bar. i was heated.

anyways, i am also female and i look young for my age, which is already not that old. if it had been one of my male coworkers i really doubt he would have said any of that. 

honestly just where do people get off telling people how to do their job regardless of whether they had a similar job (it did not seem he worked in a high volume atmosphere given his lack of reading the environment).

not gone lie i was frustrated with the place since day one. but i had enough of this place and the sleazy management. 

so on this particular day i was closing 6pm-12am. relived the bartender that was there earlier and she decided to hangout and catch up.  we will call her m. 

setting is a “sake and sushi”, restaurant with a full bar. 

and like on cue walks in the intoxicated manger bragging on how he drank so much at some nearby restaurant. 

i tell him he should get something to eat and drink water to sober up. 
he refused like the idiot he is, well call him d for dumbass. 
  
then he gets the smart idea to tell me to pour a shot of tequila to m. 

m: no i can’t drink i’m going to the gym. plus i’m driving. 

d: just pour the shot! 

me: no! you pour it. 

d: fine

m: don’t! i’m not gonna take it. 

d: you’re gonna take. 

m: no, i’m not 

d: (pours shot of tequila, places shot in front of m)

“ you’re gonna take the shot or your fired”

m: bullshit 

(another server calls for his help and walks away. )

i grab the shot and toss it in the trash. 

(he walks back to the bar and notices the empty shot glass,)

d: “see that wasn’t that bad!”

m just rolls her eyes

( i was busy with the garnishes, looked back up and he’s pouring another shot)

d: “here take this one too or else”

m:are you kidding?

d: “you better!”

(walkie-talkie calls for him to go to the kitchen; he walks off to the kitchen and out of sight)

i again slide over to where she’s seated grab the shot and flicked it into the trash bin. then place the glass into the sink.

went back to garnish (lime wheels)

took a double take and guess who was pouring tequila again.

places the shot in front of m,

d: one more?

m: no i’m done! storms off and leaves the restaurant...

(while the hostess is walking a couple to the bar.
couple is waiting for a table and have a bottle of wine they want me to open.)

i stare the manager down and point to the kitchen. he miraculously walks away and things get back to order. 

i open the couples bottle of wine and pour out two glasses while they wait for there table. 

couple give me a $5 tip and head to there table. 

45-60mins past

couple returns to the bar, “two baby guinness’s!”

me: no problem. 

couple: wait! instead of khalua, can you exchange it for patron coffee xo?

me: sure! 

( two mexican- irish baby’s up!)

couple takes the shots, husband wants another she agrees. i ring up two shots. 

but she only agreed that he can take another, not that she wanted one. (my mistake) 

walkie-talkie manger to bar

10mins later

walkie-talkie manager again

couple wants to pay and leave, manager no show. 
go find manager 

manager in his phone playing some stupid game on his phone. 

told him to follow me to the bar and i’ve been calling you. 

show him the error and starts to asking me, 

“but why?” ( like a fucking 12 year old)

i begged him,( please just delete this one drink so they can go ?)

finally deletes the shot and walks away

processed the transaction and while handing the checkbook to the couples 

they ask me, “what the hell is wrong with him?!”

me: oh! he’s drunk and a man child. 

i noticed he over heard me call him out and signals me over to talk. 

i walk over and he starts stuttering on how he overheard me talking about him. 

“ you’re dam rite i am and i’ll talk shit about you rite here in front of you. you idiot!”

d: leave! go home!!

me: go home?! fuck you im gone! 

(while i’m pickup my tools and all the stuff i have bought for this cheap ass bar) 

the couple come over shake my hand and give me another cash tip and tell me. 

“ you’re worth more than this place”.

told them thanks and went back to getting all my tools and leaving as fast as can before i let my anger get the better of me.

my new job is basically the complete flipside to the previous one. it’s a big, flashy and expensive venue with a huge food wine, beer and cocktail menu that focusses on customer service to an exceptional degree. i’m learning a lot about everything on the menu and getting better every shift with the service side of things, but struggling alot with (imo) demanding and entitled customers. 

i haven’t lost my temper or anything, but feel more like i’m dying on the inside when i encounter certain situations,  i ruminate on it and it ruins an otherwise good shift. the majority of the patrons i serve are 100% fine, it’s really just a minority that i feel present a problem - but they psych me out and i feel a bit demoralized.

a few examples of customers i encounter:

- big groups ordering together, one drink at a time, changing their minds a few times, splitting bills, then adding more onto an order when i’m a split second away from moving on to the next customer, then getting annoyed at slow wait times.

- people waving money, credit cards or shouting “i’m next!”  or “he/she’s next!”

- people start ordering while you’re still serving someone else, as in just yelling out their order like: “veuve! margarita! long island!!!” 

- vegans/vegetarians mad that i can’t take meat out of a dish that’s been slow cooking with meat in sauce for 8hours

- people with running tabs just walking off with a round, not mentioning anything about a tab, so i have to chase them into a crowd and get their tab #.

- eye rolls, scoffs and disgust when we don’t stock their favourite brand of beer/wine/liquor (that is definitely overpriced swill anyway)

-the whole no straw movement thing (we have paper straws)

-over eager bro’s heckling to over-pour / free pour (this is illegal an instant dismissal in my state)

the list goes on. and on some more.
normally i’m polite but assertive and can deal with the general shittiness of people i serve, my manager has given me positive feedback about having a good manner with customers. 

i guess i just feel a bit rusty with the whole thing, and was hoping to get any tips from you guys about this. cheers

852,tequila worms. sort of.,"
i'm not entirely sure this is the correct place to post this,  but i was reminded of it today,  and thought other people may enjoy the laugh/ disgust that follows. 

about 20 years ago,  when i was a young and naive ( and very scared of my boss) bartender,  i worked in a nightclub that had been converted from an old cinema. 

now,  the company i worked for weren't known for splashing the cash,  so when they did a refit ( before my time), they got the minimum of work done to the bottom 2 floors to transform it into a venue. 

the third floor ran the beer lines across the ceiling, but to get from one end to the other you had to crawl over a 30ft drop , no exaggeration. yes.  the beer was foul. 

anyway,  the lighting booth was sort of half way between the second and third floor,  and controlled by the dj booth downstairs,  so rarely entered into.  it was also directly above the main bar. 

the club had a capacity of 1200, and was frequently at that capacity,  when one particularly  busy night we saw things ... sort of like dirt but not quite.. falling out of the two end light fixtures. 

sadly that was the of the bar i was working.  i was getting adept at sweeping the crud off the bar before the ( happily quite drunk) customers noticed,  but was then asked for ten shots of tequila - not uncommon,  it was so busy we'd frequently take orders for 10+ drinks at a time. 

i put the drinks in their teeny little shot glasses on the bar,  put the charge on the till... and turned round to see one of the customers screaming ""yes!!! i got the worm!!!""

our brand of tequila doesn't have worms.  

before i could stop him,  he necked it,  and crapped on how lucky he was.  it was at this point , i saw a maggot descend from the ceiling and lie prostate on the bar. as it dawned on me that the ' tequila worm ' had committed some sort of bizarre alcoholic suicide,  all i could do was swipe away the remaining evidence.. and charge them for the drinks.

i've never felt so guilty yet hysterically amused on my life.  there's still a tinge of guilt to this day. 

we never heard any thing more about it,  and it was discovered there was a hole in the roof above the lighting booth,  where a seagull had chosen to crawl in and die right above the lighting fixture. 

we fixed the hole. 

the club sadly no longer exists ( although sometimes disastrous,  it was a great place to work ; as long as you didn't drink the beer or tequila!) and a great place on your night off too.

it died when the company decided to modernise it from a rock/ metal/ biker bar to a young and cool student place.  

it was haunted too, i've got sooo many stories about that place,  but that's one of the ones that taught me how fast a bar tender has to act!

868,more spirits than you wanted!,"i posted last night about a club i worked in for several years.  it had one of the most haunted reputations in &lt; somewhere&gt; , and i could literally write for days about some of the really weird spooky stuff happened in.

so,  i'd like to hear what other haunted/ scary/ inexplicable other bar tenders have had at work.  here's on to start you off:)

originally,  around the 1900's, it was a circus that caught for fire,  burning several people alive. 
later on it was turned into a cinema;  one memorable event there was when a disillusioned protectionist hanged himself from the roof beams  .

after it got turned into a bar/ club in the 80s ( i think?) , there were literally hundreds of usually sane people who would witness some peculiar things in there ( yes,  even the sober ones)

this is not my story,  but one of my favourites.  

my friend y and his girl friend c were doing some maintenance in the girls toilets,  when c said she was grabbing some lunch.they were alone in the building at the time.  

  y said no problem,  thinking she was getting something from next door,  and then heard a giggle and the door of the cubicle (he was painting !) slammed begging him.  he thought it c playing a joke on him because regarded of the safety latch the door would not open.  after about half an hour of him yelling every insult under the sun to c, and only getting giggling in response,  it suddenly stopped  and the door swung open. 

y ran out of the bathrooms,  and got to the top of the stairs,  just in time to see c come in with a giant bag of mickeyds.. she's been gone the whole time ( they later confirmed it on the security camera).

i believe they ate lunch outside that day. ",hypnoticwinter,bar

hello, so at the beginning of 2018 i started as a bar back/ glassy, with only restaurant (1.5 years) and no bar experience. over the past year i've gotten really good at my job to the point where i'm relied on the most, and if there's a problem,i'm called first to take care of it. through observing and jumping behind the bar occasionally i've learned how to bartend to the point where i could hold my own on our busiest nights, that was in august. my managers promote other servers (who honestly are pretty mediocre) to bartending over me and when i ask why, they dodge the question or just rotate the same excuses, for example we just fired 3 bartenders yet somehow there's no space on the bar for me, ""if we put you on bar who will replace you on the floor?"". i bust my ass for this place and i'm just getting more and more frustrated that working harder doesn't change my situation just makes it worse. i'm sorry for the long rant but hopefully you guys with more experience can give me some wisdom.

-shaved ice
-pencil shavings
-goat milk
-hot water (obviously lol)
-black spray paint

okay now that we have everything we need lets get started! so first were gonna get a mug and give it a good squirt of honey. once weve done that were gonna squeeze half a lemon into the mug. now were take our chai tea bag and rip it open and proceed to eat it (youre gonna need all that caffeine to wake up you little sleepy head). okay this next step is important so dont mess it up you bitch. get yourself a shaker and dump two teaspoons of sand in there. now pour about a pint of goat milk into the shaker with the sand. next were gonna drop about two tablespoons of pencil shavings in that bad boy hunk of a shaker. add shaved ice and shake until the ice is completely melted or the shaker breaks (either way is perfect!). our mix should now be a grayish color. now were gonna pour the mix into the mug. top with a half ounce of hot water obviously. now all thats left is a garnish! sprinkle some hairs in there but make sure they float. and last things last just give it a quick squirt of spray paint to finish it off!! all done.

897,i'm getting sick of this job.,"i've been at my current bar since october 2018. i've tolerated the job, for all this time, but it's getting annoying now. the current manager is okay as a person, but she's an anal-retentive ocd freak. always complaining about stupid little things, sometimes, dragging me away from customers over some bullshit. some examples:

i was making a g&amp;t for a customer. the manager comes up, and starts complaining that about the empty bottle of tonic that was on the bar. keep in mind that at this point, i had just finished making the drink, and i hadn't even taken the money yet, plus the bin was on the other side of the bar. even the customer was looking at her like she was crazy. it wasn't a big deal, certainly not enough of a big deal to make an issue out of in front of customers.

i got pulled up for putting the jar of peanuts back literally 3 centimetres (i measured it) from where she wanted it. seriously, who gives a fuck?! get a life.

i got called out for using a tiny amount of soda water from the gun for cleaning because it's ""wasting the gas"". 

on some sundays, we don't even get breaks, it's that fucking busy. it really shouldn't be this way, but it is.

we used to have autonomous company serving food in the bar until around last year. that suited me just fine, as we have enough shit to deal with the drinks side of things. now, it's all the same company, meaning we have to deal with all the food orders, complaints, etc. we're now doing even more work, for exactly the same pay as before. now, on saturday, i was already pretty stressed, and the manager was bitching me out because the printed ticket from the kitchen didn't have the table number. we've long since established that due to a flaw in the system, this sometimes happens. this time she was really annoyed at me, and i couldn't remember who the hell it was for due to the sheer volume of customers i serve (i've seen the end of day reports, i make that place two or three times the amount of money that some of my co-workers do). when i finally found them, i saw that the customer still had the receipt i gave him in his hand, which was proof that i was in the right. i asked him if i could borrow it, then i took it to the kitchen, and in front of the chefs, i told the manager that it's not my fucking fault if the fucking machine doesn't print the fucking table numbers! after finishing that 12 hour shift, which i damn nearly just walked out of, i went straight to bed, and i woke up next day with a headache that lasted all day. this isn't the first time this has happened, and i couldn't even blame it on drink as i hadn't touched a drop for almost a week. i don't need this stress for such a low wage. like i said, it's nothing personal, but this manager complains about insignificant things that no other manager i've ever worked for would even give a damn about. i'm not the only person who's getting frustrated by her, either. my colleagues are drinking on the job just to make it tolerable, something they weren't doing as much before. the fact that i live almost 20 miles away from the job (1 hour by train) doesn't make it any better, either. i need to get a new job, and soon.",thwip62,bar

for those in the us, how do you live off of bartending? 
do you bartend full time or part time?

most of the jobs i see are for part time positions.
if you work part time, do you make enough to live off of it?
if yes, what does that look like? humble apartment for yourself or scraping by with a couple of roomates? what do you do for healthcare? 

if it's not enough to live on, how do you supplement your income or meet basic needs? second job, spouse/partner, parents?

most of the work out there would have been great for when i was still in college, living with my parents. but what does bartending look like when you're an adult living on your own, with rent/mortgage, car payment/insurance, etc?

921,a quick rant about uber and lyft with my recent experiences,i’m getting real tired of late night uber and lyft drivers again i ordered my ride and it was picked up. it said 8 minutes. i watched on the ap as the driver drove further and further away from my location. i tried calling three times with no answer. finally another driver picked it up. i called the original driver again and she said she cancelled the ride. nope. she didn’t. she didn’t want to get charged for cancelling so she just drove until someone else got it. uber and lyft came as big as they are because people were sick of shitty cab service. their drivers have become just as bad as cabies. not all but i’ve had some really bad experiences lately. the last thing i need after an exhausting 3 days in a row is worrying about my ride home and being stuck for the amount of time it would take me to get home. end rant.,Loud_Snort,bar

926,question about the bars program and the ethics of how it's used,"alright people, i'm a server not a bartender but i work in a microbrew that has a kitchen, and i serve alcohol. as such i assume the risk of checking id as well. i've been trying to figure out what the deal with the bars program is. someone at my place of employment was just fired last week for receiving a red card. now, i'd never even heard of the bars program before because i'm a rather new server. so, i decided to research what this was, because for me it seemed to go from 0 to 100 real quick there, and i just wanted to be as informed as possible about the stakes of my job. upon going to the bars website, i watched the intro video on the ""how it works"" page and the president can be quoted saying,

""if one of your people happens to be the one that got a red card, that's a training opportunity.""

the vice president goes on to say,

""what we've learned over time is that by keeping that person in the store that received a red card, they're constantly training other new employees that come on...""

so why is everyone getting fired over these things? this appears to be marketed as a training/monitoring/prevention service to help employees and establishments as a whole become better, and to save employees' jobs and establishments hassle. it seems a bit unfair that it's used as a ""pruning"" service instead. i just find it incredibly contradicting the bars program seems brand themselves as constructive when they are more or less just getting people fired left and right. that's not really improvement, because there's no chance to learn or improve. you're just gone, and the next poor grunt just takes your place on the front line, no better off. does anyone understand this better that could perhaps explain a different perspective i'm not seeing?",lbiohazardl,bar
927,whats your most stupid reasoning someone has argued against getting told to leave a bar?,"so today, had this one man almost falling asleep in a chair. 

i start speaking to his partner and inform that its time to take him home in which she replies and tells me let them call a taxi, i find this reasonable and allow them to do so...

i go about counting tills in the office and notice the man walk out side to the smokers area and witness him piss all over the bench....

when i confront them again and tell them its time for him to leave because he has just pissed all over the seating area. his partner gets all defensive saying how he shouldnt leave, and that its better out there then indoors and that our pub should work on a 3 strike policy...

cut long story short, she was saying how he wasnt drunk and how its unfair he has to leave and he is sober... all while her partner is wobbling unable to stand still and focus his gaze",DestressedPancakes,bar

940,i found it!,"some time around last week i made a post asking you folks if you knew if any databases of food chemical compositions, and links to other foods with similar compounds. it's the same idea behind why white chocolate and caviar go well together. 

i got some decent feedback, the best advice was to check out the flavor bible and flavor thesaurus. 

however, i found a website that was *exactly* what i was looking for, and i'd like to share it with you guys and see what you think. 

foodb.ca

you can search a food, scroll down to find the main chemical compounds present, click a compound, then scroll down again to find foods with that specific compound in them. its been a pretty neat tool for me so far.

952,regular smells like dirty asshole,"so at my bar, we have this regular i’ll call g. g is a pretty nice guy but is overall disgusting. he nearly died a year ago from fluid buildup in his lungs and switched from drinking beer to drinking wine. he finishes a bottle by himself in about 30 minutes. he has the shakes before he starts drinking and once he gets to the second bottle of wine he starts mumbling to himself. occasionally (2-3 times per month) he’ll get extremely upset over something very minor. he usually takes it easy around me but he’s definitely bothered some of our female bartenders. he’s been banned from multiple bars in the area (though that’s mostly cause he goes elsewhere after he comes to our spot, so he’s already drunk when he gets there).

g has always smelled bad, but usually you have to be near him to smell him. over the past couple weeks, though, it’s gotten worse. today was so bad that i could smell him from the other end of the bar. multiple tables (about 15 feet away from him) complained to their servers about his greasy stench. g smelled like two-a-days, and you could smell him 15 minutes after he had left.

and here’s the thing: g comes in like 6 days a week and his average check is like $70. he’s rarely annoying and is essentially easy money. i don’t want to be the one to say something because it feels like biting the hand that feeds me. my managers are both extremely non-confrontational and won’t say anything about it. we have multiple other regulars that are in as often as he is, but they all refuse to say anything because they don’t want to hurt his feelings. i point out that they all talk shit about g when he isn’t here (not just on his hygiene issues, other stuff too), but won’t give him a talking to that he legitimately needs, so it’s not like they’re being nice about it.
