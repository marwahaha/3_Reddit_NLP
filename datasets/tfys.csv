0,dedicated thread for new server advice,"hi all,

&amp;#x200b;

i realized our new server advice thread, which has tons of good advice and comments, has been archived, so new and veteran servers can't post questions/answers.  i got permission from the mods to post a new thread, so whether you're a new server with a specific/general question or a server who has some good advice, feel free to jump in!

1,table walked out on me today.,"tbh, i didnt care and thought it was funny. it was a 2 top older couple. greeted them right away, promptly got them waters and got the guys beer order in. but we only had one bartender on at the time for a full bar (typically one comes in at 4pm and the other at 5pm)

so she is busy dealing with people serving people sitting at the bar. it took her like 5 minutes to get to my tickets beer.

but as soon as she set the beer down for me to take to them, they both get up and head for the door. and before i could even say a word the old lady scoffs, ""no. you take too long for everything."" they head on out.

i'm standing there baffled and confused like wtf just happened?

i find it funny cuz the jokes on them. they wasted their own time coming there and being extremely impatient. hope that 5 minutes wait is worth the gas cuz the prices are going up. fucking people man.",screamtastic,tfys
2,woman so drunk that she forgot she ate her food.,"10 top walking in! it’s happy hour and they are ordering drinks.  9/10 of them are at the table so only 9/10 of them ordered drinks.

this one very special lady who was quite buzzed, was in the bathroom while i took the drink orders so when she came back i took her drink order and of course the first 9/10 other drinks come out first.  special lady has a special high pitched “i wanna tlk 2 ur manager” voice. like when the wayan’s brothers try to talk like women on white chicks. 

special lady: “ where is my drink?!” 

me “you ordered after everyone so it’s coming out last”

special lady: “but everyone else got their drinks!!” 

yeah well no shit, strike 1. 

special lady gets her moscow mule with mostly ginger beer and orders 4 items from the menu. *special lady not only ate those 4 items but shared them with her table too.*

special lady proceeds to order a drink for her boy toy who has done nothing but apologize for her being loud and obnoxious (poor guy) and when the drink is delivered, special lady says “i didnt order that”  obviously i had to contest that statement and her friends backed me up, saying she’s once again being an embarrassment. strike 2. 

alerted the manager because i knew it was gonna get worse. 

checks!!! thank god checks. but nope special lady says she didn’t get the 4 items she ordered. she only remembers getting 2. i told special lady i saw her eat the 4 items she got. strike 3

special lady: “where is my ribs?!”

me: “the bones are right in front of you, looks like you ate them”

at this point all her friends are telling her she got food and she cannot believe she ate it or even got it. 

special lady decides enough is enough and corners me at the pos while i’m setting glassware down from pre-bussing and gets within inches of my face, telling me that she only ordered 2 items and keeps changing the whole “i didn’t get my 4 items” to “i only ordered 2 things”  special lady gets so close to me in my face and talking with her drunk hands that she knocks the glassware and she proceeds to stand in a puddle of alcohol and broken glass in the front entrance and berate me, meanwhile i’m trying to guide her outside without touching her, all her friends aren’t doing anything at this point . she refused to pay for her food so i quickly handed the bill to her boytoy who paid and we had to tell her if she didn’t leave the front entrance we would call the cops, all because she forgot she ate her food. 


don’t worry special lady, i forgive you.

3,kill them with kindness. kill them with kindness. kill them with kindness!,"i am just average lunch bartender. i work at a local bar/restaurant and have been here for 5 years. as such, i have a lot of regulars, some of which i am pretty close to. 

last friday my regulars are asking me how i’ve been managing. we were just shut down for almost two months for a remodel and my s.o. broke his foot right before it started so we both didn’t have income coming in. i was telling them how we were getting by and how lucky i feel to be able to get most of my bills paid. enter entitled middle aged bitch. 

entitled bitch: “are you though?”

me: “am i what?” 

e.b.: “lucky?” 

me: “yes, i feel like i am very lucky. things could have been so much worse. our bills are paid, our daughter has everything she needs and we aren’t hurting”. 

eb: “*lucky? ha!* working in a restaurant? is that what you would want for your daughter?” 

me: (a little shocked at this point, go into super customer service mode) “you are so thoughtful to be so worried! thank you so much for your concern! do you need anything else right now?” 

eb: (clearly upset i’m not feeding into this) “no, i’m fine. i just think...”

me: (i cut her off, have a huge smile on face) “okay! just let me know if you need anything!” 

i took a break to smoke a cig after this. i am a damn good mom. i don’t need some lady inserting herself into a conversation and trying to make me feel like i am less than because i work in a restaurant. my daughter has everything she could possibly ever want/need. my whole world revolves around her and i’m constantly playing with her, teaching her and mothering her to the best of my abilities. i might not have a lot of money but she is happy and healthy. also, she’s not even 2 yet. it’s not like she even knows about money, let alone what i do for a living.

4,i quit my last resturaunt mainly because of a regular that sat at the bar for 4.5 hours 3 to 4 times a week. he talked non stop about nothing and he smelled awful.,"he was half the reason i quit. the day came where i told myself if he walks in i'm going to tell him directly, ""i quit and it's because of you."" he never came unfortunately but my adrenaline was pumping, ready to quit, so i did. i left a note and walked out.

my old coworkers tell me that he hasn't been back since. that pisses me off so much. i was so overjoyed to know that i didn't have to deal with the smelly talkative guy anymore but lo and behold he apparently only came because of me. i never got to see his reaction finding out i quit and i never got my satisfaction.

i still think back to the long nights when he'd keep me 1 hr passed closing. i'm so grateful that i found a better resturaunt with higher class clientele.",IEATTURANTULAS,tfys
5,3 old guys come in to the newly opened golf course cafe/restaurant demanding our prices match a&amp;w.,"apparently back in the day the 19th hole was always busy and every table would be full for breakfast.   breakfast at a golf course is always the seniors crowd.  when the restaurant was contracted out, the prices changed from $7 to $11 for a full breakfast (this was over 5 years ago).

everyday while trying to get the place open and running, the seniors keep coming in to see what the renovations look like and comment on how the food need to be cheaper.  3 old guys came in yesterday morning say that our breakfast be priced better then a fast food joint down the street.  i have been to that place and take out for 2 people was over $25 after coffee, juice,  and a breakfast combos. i told them that it is expensive out there and the prices aren't going to be $5 for a breakfast meal anywhere. these fckers pull out coupons and just look at me.  

 3 years ago min wag was $10 and it is now $15!! good luck finding a full breakfast for $5! i'm so glad i dont rely on tips cause my attitude is going downhill after dealing with these goat smelling old dudes every morning. ",vyvanseandvodka,tfys
6,is this a normal restaurant environment?,"just started at a restaurant/bar a few months ago and i think i'm going to leave because of how ridiculously stressed it makes me. i've done waitressing before, but that was a chain and this is privately owned. however, i dont want to leave for another private business (where i have a job offer) if it's going to be more of the same. i also think i want someone to tell me i'm not crazy or a bad server for being so stressed at my current establishment. 

i think the problem starts with the owner living above the bar. it's a small bar, we have about 28 tables and a good amount of those are 2 tops, but we probably have about 10 cameras in the dining room alone. and the owner watches them constantly. i've been marrying ketchups before and have thrown a bottle away because some of the glass broke and had the owner come downstairs and asked why i threw it out. it gives me so much anxiety knowing i'm constantly being observed. also, while the owner watches he doesnt help us run the bar. i mean he does all the behind the scenes stuff, but if we're slammed he wont bring a table menus. but he will yell at us to while we're running hot food, etc if he happens to be in the dining room.  

we also do everything by hand because we dont have a computer system. we also make our own drinks, run our own food, bus, etc. so some weekend nights it gets really hectic. the closing procedure is insane as far as cash etc. i wont get into it but it takes a good hour to close out the register and do paperwork for the money. he will then go through our closing envelope with a fine toothed comb and go through every single ticket for the entire night. if we forgot to charge someone 2.00 extra for waffle fries it gets brought up the next day. one night i accidentally left one of the tiny lights above the liquor on in one of the liquor cabinets and got yelled at in front of customers at the bar and was compared to a child. then when i fuck up once i fuck up over and over because now i'm nervous. and know i'm being watched. 

everyone there has either been there 5 years or is brand new. there are no median employees. they either learn to live with it or leave. 

i have a job offer at another private place but this one is very upscale and i would be making more money. i want to leave but i dont want to have to start all over if this is just typical restaurant environment. if so it really is not for me. i love the money but i can't have mistakes thrown in my face every shift.",giantmaneatingotters,tfys
7,april fools?,"this is long and there's a tl;dr at the end. so i've been at this game for a while and my experience with a lady last night is definitely on my wall of fame. i didnt know whether to feel bad because she actually seemed mentally unwell. anyway, she came in and asked for a table for two outside, mind you the sun is down and its in the 40s, i greet her and get her drink order. then i take her food order and as she goes to hand me the two menus back, she looks to the empty seat and asks ""and for you?"" i looked at her a little confused and she just laughed. weird but whatever. then, as i am walking back inside, she yells ""excuse me!"" and asks for a straw. sure thing, i turn back around and hear ""excuse me!"" she wants another tea. yes maam. i turn back around and get the third ""excuse me!"". she needs another water. by the time i make the drinks, i turned around and she was moving inside because it was ""cold out there"". less walking for me, cool. except she left all her drinks and whatnot outside. i ran out and grabbed them for her and put the plate across from her and she stops me and asks me to move it slightly to the right, directly across from her. then it starts to escalate very quickly.

she set the extra drinks up in a place setting and when the food came, she put a slice of pizza on the plate and started reading aloud from a journal she had been writing in. its not the first time i have seen people do stuff like this but the talking to the empty seat was a little weird. she ate her slice and then the other slice off the plate opposite her and then asked me to remove the extra setting, one item at a time. she then got up walked to the bathroom, and stopped me to ask me if it was in fact the bathroom. she was probably in there for close to ten minutes before she came out and walked up to our expo and told him the bathroom needed cleaning. this lady had taken all of the cleaning supplies, trashcans, plungers etc. out of the bathroom stalls and placed them in the hallway blocking the bathroom door. she went as far as emptying the trash and placing the full bag in the hallway. oh and then filled an entire toilet full of toilet paper. wtf.

at this point, i dropped off the check and a box for her while she aimlessly wandering around the restaurant chatting people up. she cornered a coworker and told him about her future husband, jesus, and her poetry and so on. and then i see her walk over to our expo window which has garnishing herbs and cheese out, cough all over it and then pick up a big block of parmesan cheese and a grater and start going to town grating it right on to the floor. i ran over and told her she needed to stop because it was a health code violation, and she had just touched everything in the bathroom, and she said ""oh"" and handed me the cheese that i promptly threw away. she then started playing in the container of chopped basil. i did my best patient server voice and again told her she needed to stop and get away from the window and she asked me why all this stuff was there then. i explained it was a healthcode issue and i now had to throw the whole container away and she responded ""oh, well then throw it away"" and stuck her hand in every other herb there and walk away. she continued wandering around the restaurant touching everything and tried to wander behind the bar. after harassing the kitchen staff for a while she finally did a lap and said goodbye to everyone and i server mode kicked in because i knew she hadnt paid her bill yet.

she packs up her stuff and stands up and starts walking toward our side door. i ran over and grabbed the check, chasing after calling loudly for her. she made it out the door and a couple steps away when she turned around and acknowledged me and i asked her to please come back in and pay for her food. this lady turns around, walks back inside and slowly walks across the entire restaurant and out the front door, while i'm walking right behind her. she walked about halfway down the patio while i was following and calling her before i finally lost it and yelled ""ma'am, i know you can hear me!"". she turned around and said ""wow you're so patient"". trying not to fully loose it, i got her back inside and paid. what. the. fuck. the whole time i was waiting for her to say april fools and it never happened. i dont know if i was pranked or an actual crazy person was running around wreaking havoc for an hour.

tl;dr crazy lady has dinner with jesus and then proceeds to wreak havoc on the restaurant and attempt a double dine and dash.",ahalfdozen,tfys
8,woman brings in bank statement over 1$ discrepancy,"so yesterday a woman came into the restaurant and i went up to talk to her she had her bank statement and a receipt from last week that she showed me that she only tipped her server 5$ and it was a whole dollar over on her bank statement

and let me tell you she was pissed after i said it was probably an honest mistake (her 5's totally could've been mistaken as  a 6 they were curly and almost closed) she said they should've known from the total but again her 5's and 6's look almost identical so 

 i just shut my mouth and got my manager while the rest of us wondered how much gas money she wasted by coming back here probably more than 1$

after she left our manager said she wouldn't shut up about how her server should've known better and done the math (like tables never mess up on the final math) and we all got a good laugh out of it",RogueAngel87,tfys
9,house chardonnay,"guys. 

when i went to pick up a glass of chardonnay from the service bar tonight, there was a gentleman standing there with a menu, placing a to-go order. this is pretty normal, lots of people do this because it’s close to the bartender’s computer.

i grabbed the glass of chardonnay and the guy says “hey! that’s mine!” i kinda laughed it off, just thinking he was screwing with me. but then i noticed that there was definitely a sip out of it. 

i set it down and was like... “oh, did you order a glass for while you wait? i thought this one was mine because that’s my drink ticket beside it.” 

he just stared at me. then he says, “oh. i thought it was for me. the bartender placed it beside me and the ticket said ‘house chardonnay,’ so i thought it was, you know, on the house.” 

it was my turn to stare. what the actual hell? 

i asked the bartender for another glass and ran away because i didn’t think i could actually hold back my laughter anymore. 

the kicker? he didn’t even finish it. he just left it there, with a big sip out of it, at the service bar. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️",missjlynne,tfys

11,old man makes my day,"daria here: 

i am a host at a local restaurant in my hometown. i typically work saturday nights and sunday mornings (as i'm attending/living at college an hour away and it just makes things easier for me and the other hosts). 

it was a sunday morning shift (we open at 11 am) and some regulars come in. it is a man with (usually) both of his parents who are disabled or they both just have a hard time walking on their own. (the son is about 50-55 and his parents are in their late 70s). 

the son and the dad come in, and the mom wasn't there for some reason (i honestly don't remember why). they eat their food and they are always smart asses, but overall nice people to serve and deal with as sunday mornings suck. 

they finish their food and the son is carrying multiple to-go boxes and is struggling (for some reason he hates the to-go bags?) so, the dad had already started walking towards the door with his cane. seeing the son struggling, i open the door for the dad. he smiles at me and thanks me. his son thanks me and gets into his car to place the food down (he was going to be coming back for his dad btw). there is a little bit of a step down to get to his car so i just helped the dad down and opened the door to his car to help him out. 

the dad stopped in his tracks and said, ""you know, out of all the years i have been going to restaurants you're the only one who has gone above and beyond to help me out."" 

i was a little shocked. all i did was open the door and help him into his car because him and his son were struggling in that moment. 

i kindly told him it was no problem and closed the car door behind him. the son thanked me again and i went inside to continue working. 

i'm not gonna lie, i had a pep in my step for the rest of the shift. ",Dogsrule234,tfys

16,i was accidentally a karen today,"let me preface this by saying i’ve worked in food service since i was sixteen, and in the wise words of john mulaney, my quote in life is basically, “you could pour soup in my lap and i’d probably apologize to you!” i’ve been screamed at my fair share of times and have absolutely cried in the employee bathroom over it. so i try to be very polite when ordering but today i was did a boo-boo i still feel guilty over even if the server has absolutely forgotten my prissy ass by now. 

i was ordering lunch at my college campus, we have cooks that can be a little short but it’s fine because hey, college kids are annoying. so everyone’s kind of hobbling around waiting for food and after five minutes of waiting in line i realize all these people have ordered already. no biggie, so i just walk up to the front. except all the cooks have their eyes downcast, totally fine i’ll wait. i wait another five minutes then think to myself, “oh! maybe they think i already ordered!” so, i ask, “can i put in my order please?” no response. okay, maybe they didn’t hear me, i’m super quiet. so a little louder now, “excuse me, can i please put in my ord-“

“give us a minute, lady. christ.” comes the response and i immediately feel my soul leave my body. oh god, i’m a shitty consumer. i’ve become what i loathe. and the guy is angry enough that i can’t even apologize and get my veggie burger slid down to me with a lowkey glare as i thank the guy and get the hell outta the food court. anyone else have any stories where they were an accidental karen? i know i wasn’t too awful but that cooks glare is still making me squirm even two hours after.

17,the tale of the fried grilled chicken with the fried on the side,"this is not my story, it happened to a friend of mine who works at a small restaurant up by boston. he has tons of these stories and i thought i’d share this one with you guys because it was particularly funny/ridiculous. 

so he’s taking a families takeout order and at first all is well. the father and kids put in their orders like normal people. when it gets to the wife she starts asking a lot of questions. from here on out i’ll call her deep fried crazy lady or dfcl for short. 

my friend: what can i get for you?

dfcl: what kind of chicken do you have?

friend: we have platters with grilled chicken or fried chicken. 

dfcl: well i need the healthy option but not the normal way. 

friend: okay no problem, how would you like it?

dfcl: i want fried grilled chicken with the fried on the side. 

friend: um i’m sorry but i don’t understand what you mean

dfcl: (getting irritated very quickly) i want the grilled chicken but fried. 

friend: oh okay, you’d like us to deep fry the chicken breast?

dfcl: yes but with the fried in the side!

friend: do you mean with fries in the side?...

dfcl: no! i mean with the fried part on the side!

friend: ma’am i’m not quite sure how our cook would do that.  

this goes on for awhile with my friend offering to do the chicken sautéed but she kept insisting she wanted “fried grilled chicken with the fried on the side.” finally he realized that she was asking him to stick a grilled chicken breast in the fryer with nothing on it and to put the breadcrumbs on the side. he consulted the cook to see if that could be done, and got hysterical laughter from all the kitchen staff as his response. he went back and told the woman he could not do that. she refused to order anything else and asked to speak to a manager, at which point he had to awkwardly explain that he was the manager.

18,regular that never tips: what do you do?,"hey guys! so this question has crossed my mind recently because i was her server the other day. this late 20s woman comes in sporadically but always at least once a month. she always orders the same thing, always takes 2 bites of her food, and is a completely miserable person. to date, she had never tipped her server. it’s to the point where i warn new servers when she sits in their section.

so my question is, would you give her perfect service, or save your attention for tables that are actually going to tip? i’ve done both and it doesn’t affect her lovely attitude or her lack of tipping. in a perfect world i’d ask why she always comes back when all she does is waste her server’s time.

kicker is based on what she wears and drives, she’s clearly not hurting for money. she just chooses not to tip.",sweet-tides,tfys
19,“everything here is great except the service!”,"i work at an upscale chain in vancouver. we get a bunch of suits during the day, and a mixed bag at night. i’m working dinner service last night when...

a husband and wife in their 60s sit down. i give them some time (3-4 minutes) with the menu and approach their table. “hello -“ i say, barely, before the woman interrupts me with “i almost left! i didn’t think there was service here.” i apologize profusely. she asks for a wine recommendation. i bring her two tasters and she’s very happy with my suggestions, they order a bottle. they order the lowest calorie appy because “i’m on a very strict calorie counting diet, darling.” she asks if she’ll be able to share the appy with her husband and have a salad after. i tell her that the appy is very light - sautéed veg and peanuts in a chili oil sauce with a lettuce head on the side to wrap the contents. there should be no issue eating a salad after that. 

appy hits the table. i check in 1 minute later, and she says to me, “cancel my salad. there is literally no way i could eat a salad after this giant appetizer.” she’s had two bites of lettuce. maybe the fact that she’s had almost half a bottle of wine is at play here. i cancel the salad. i come back to tell her, and ask how everything is.

here’s the kicker. she says to me:

“i don’t come here often, and always forget how fantastic the food is. but my biggest issue with this place is how bad the service is.”

i’m almost speechless, i simply say “thank you for your feedback i’m happy to pass that on to the manager.” she nods knowingly. 

bill time comes. her silent and apologetic-looking husband makes small talk with me as she tips me 10% - i was expecting 0%, so i’m glad that at least i don’t have to pay to tip out on their $100 meal. 

another twist - bear with me guys - half an hour after they leave, the husband comes back. i run up to him thinking “shit god damn it fuck what did i do.”

he reaches for my hand and says to me, “my wife was being very cranky this evening and i was so impressed that you were unwavering in your kindness and professionalism. i want to apologize her her behavior and emphasize that you were fantastic. thank you.” 

he puts a $20 in my hand and walks away. most surprising turnaround, and a 10% tip turned into a 30%. could not believe my ears and almost started crying. good people do exist! 

tl;dr: woman rips into me, saying my service is bad when i’ve given them everything they want and more. husband returns after payment and hands me a $20 and apologizes for his wife. ",plscanunot,tfys
20,"long islanders argue loudly and drunkenly, don't pay attention to payment.","table of 10 guys from long island (specific part of ny/nyc) come in one night and have dinner. their ordering process and food is really simple - a bunch of martinis and the one dude orders a ton of tapas plates and the others just join along. everything goes well.

they're a bit demanding the whole time, but also really nice. that's thing i've noticed about these kind of leather-hide-having low-social-skill guys from long island...they usually tip really well and are genuinely nice, just really brash.

well, when it comes time for the bill, the one guy starts to grab it and all the others bust out their wallets. they asked me to ""hang on one second, we'll just give you cash so you can save a trip"". awesome! but they all start arguing over who's gonna pay the bill...

lol! he probably worked for the irs or something.

**me:** ""hahaha...well i can come back in a moment gents, no problem...""

then the guy who ordered all the food just grabs all of the cash that they were all counting out, shoves it in the checkbook, slams it shut and goes ""here, here you go, just take it"". they all just start getting up and pushing in their chairs to leave.

21,the guy who is still upset about not getting a pork chop with the bone sticking off the plate - two months later,"usual friday night.  surly looking dude comes in with another man.  they are not outright rude, just short.  i get them their drinks and go to take their order.  he asks me, ""your porkchop is a tomahawk, right?  with the long bone?"" i reply ""yes!  it's delicious."" 

fast forward to when their food comes out.  for some awful reason, his doesn't have the bone sticking out.  of course.  he calls me over and points this out to me.  i've never seen our porkchop come out with no bone like that before, and i told him as such.  i inquire with the chef, and he said that it's the same cut of meat and our new sous hadn't trimmed the meat down all the way and that the bone is still there, and i guess technically the guy is getting more meat.  alright then.  i go to tell the man what the chef told me, and he goes ""well i don't know if i believe that.""  guy is sitting with his arms crossed and still hasn't taken a bite.  

at this point, i decide to get my manager involved who checks with the chef, goes out and tells the man the same thing i told him.  i didn't hear what else my manager said, but i think he said someone along the lines of ""well i hope you like the taste of it at least."" my manager comes back and says the guy doesn't want anything else, so i figured the matter was over.

while he didn't really make a scene in the restaurant, this guy flipped over social media.  he wrote a five paragraph review about what a ""proper"" tomahawk is, posted it on yelp, google reviews, facebook and emailed the company.  he even copied a review that someone else had posted, with the picture of our tomahawk, and said ""it looks like (restaurant) does know what a tomahawk is"" a week later, he uploads a picture of his boyfriend chewing on a tomahawk bone in another restaurant, making it our cover photo on yelp.  lovely.

the situation made me angry on many different levels.  one, i looked like an idiot because he specifically asked me if it was tomahawk, and i said yes.  two, while i understand that this guy didn't get what he wanted, he is literally just upset he didn't have the bone sticking off of his plate.  it was still the same cut of meat and it still had a bone (albeit smaller) three, i wish i had spoken up to my manager because i thought he would take care of it, and he didn't, although if we had gotten him another porkchop it's likely it would have been prepared the same way anyway.  

this guy seriously needs to get a life though.  i had almost forgotten about it but the reason i'm ranting about this again is this dude updated his review on yelp two months later, copied over his same 5 paragraph review, and reposted it.  ",ashhweee,tfys
22,now hiring,"so sunday was british mothers day and it went wellish? we did five hundred covers from 11:00 am til 21:00 and the kitchen only caught fire once.

biggest issue was a head waiter walked out midway through shift, complaining that ""the teenagers behind the bar arent doing anything"" by which we assume the constant collecting, cleaning and drying of glasses to support the two bartenders isn't work.

23,"they were rude to me, officer!","hey all!  first time poster, and working from mobile, so please excuse any weird formatting.  this happened a few months back, and it’s a bit lengthy, but boy is it a doozy.

to set the stage, i currently work for a bagel shop with multiple locations throughout the states.  i initially started out as a seasonal worker, doing mostly summers between college semesters.  i graduated with my bachelors in music business in 2017, and after deciding starting close to home would be the wisest decision.  unfortunately and understandably, jobs within my field that offered opportunity for advancement and networking aren’t that plentiful in upstate new york.  i returned to the store as a “full time employee” (i could go on about how liberally this term is used at my store now, but that’s a story in of itself).  working in food service, less and less shit actually ends up surprising you.  still, there’s always that one customer who somehow finds a way.  that being said, let’s get into it.

the first encounter happened on my day off, so i relied on a coworker/friend to fill in the blanks.  it was the morning shift, and the crew was busy.  being located close to the express way towards the downtown area of my city, people will come to grab half dozens and full, sometimes multiple dozens for the office every day.  on top of that, we also have a drive through, so there isn’t exactly a lack of work to be doing.  on this morning, my general manager (gm from here) was running the dt, and up pulls the star of this story (we’ll him mad man or mm).  he was your typical dress-shirt-wearing, middle aged man.  he had ordered a sandwich and some additional bagels; okay. gm begins to cash mm out.  

we’re in the middle of a rush so it takes about 5 minutes to get his stuff out.  after slowly going through the contents of his order, he knocks on the window.  “got the sandwich wrong, try it again.”   gm isn’t the type to let someone walk over her, but she smiles, says she’ll be back, and goes to make the sandwich herself.  there was nothing wrong with it, but she makes a new one from scratch, returns to the window, apologizes as she gives mm the food, and begins to close the window.  he’s already shaking his head.  “again?  really?  it’s just a salmon sandwich with mayo.  do it again.”  at this point, gm realizes what she’s dealing with.  “sir, i assure you that this is what you ordered.  i made the sandwich myself, and we have a line behind you.  if you’d like to come inside and have someone make it in front of you, we’d be happy to oblige.  i am going to need you to pull around though.”  mm replies in an overly-combative tone, “are you serious? i come here every week, and this happens.  this is unacceptable!  just remake it!”  **for full context, this was the first time anyone recalls seeing him at the store**
gm is half- dumbfounded, half-irritated, but doesn’t break character, and goes to make the sandwich.  again.  as she shuts the window, she hears mm mutter “guess they’ll just hire anyone as a manger.”  take three, and he’s more indignant than ever.  i don’t feel comfortable repeating what was allegedly said here, but there was apparently a good sprinkling of a word beginning with the letter, r thrown in.  before he can really lay into her, gm calmly but firmly cuts him off.  “sir, you’ve been here for 8 minutes.  there are 10 people behind you, and i have a store to run.  i can comp your meal today, but regardless of whether i or anyone else on my staff is making your sandwich, i will not allow you to speak to anyone here like this.  i’m afraid i will have to ask you to take your business elsewhere in the future.”   mm looks like a balding tomato at this point. “whats your name?”  gm gives him her name.  “this is the worst service i’ve ever received.  i didn’t want to do this, but you’ve left me no choice!”  mm takes his food, and finally speeds off.
a half hour later, a cop car rolls into the parking lot.  a male officer gets out, walks into the store, and asks to speak to gm.  guys, mm actually called the cops on the store for “verbal harassment and intimidation”.

long story short, gm explained her end of the story, and the cop laughs, rolling his eyes.  he assures her that he believes her account, and that this isn’t the first time this subhuman has made a report like this.  he gets back into his car, drives off, and the rest is history.  the crazy thing is that mm actually had the gaul to come back, this time while i was working.  that is another story, but this is long as is.  if you guys want, i’ll share that another time.  hope you enjoyed it!",ASockSavant,tfys

25,freak-out over fast food,"  

not sure if it fits here exactly since i'm not a server/staff in the restaurant but i saw this happened as a customer.

it happened in a local fast food restaurant that was close to a university.

my so and i were eating our lunch on a table just a few feet from the cashier. we suddenly heard a woman raise her voice, then shouting. like really loud shouting.

she was so loud that i'm sure everyone in that floor of the restaurant could hear her (not just us who were near the cashier).

there was a general ruckus/freak-out scene but i can't remember what the exchange was exactly except for some insults directed at the cashier like “you are really dumb, aren’t you?”. just before the woman (and her friend/sister) stormed out of the restaurant, she shouted something like ""you are all useless. we no longer care about the food, you wasted our time. take the food and shove it up yours."" (translated from our language)

after the commotion, i overheard the other restaurant staff talking to the cashier about what happened.

turns out that the woman presented a receipt that was dated for a previous day (the cashier said the receipt was “old”), but she claimed that she ordered minutes ago and had already been waiting for quite a while to be called by the cashier. i guess the cashier wasn’t having it and so the freak-out ensued.

the way she talked to that cashier, goddamn. the restaurant employs students to work part-time and i’m pretty sure that the cashier was a student. the cashier is a 4’10”, 40+ lbs. teen who just took insults left and right, from this rotund, middle-aged woman, like a champ. she went on to take orders from customers like nothing happened. completely smiling and all.

now to give the woman the benefit of the doubt, it may just be that she did have the wrong receipt (i guess that could happen?) and that she was just not able to produce the correct one (if there were one at all). also the fact that this restaurant is super busy (especially during lunch time), i guess lapses like this do happen. or she could have been trying to get free food and was shut down because she didn’t know receipts have dates on them.

26,“give me the white sauce”,"disclaimer: on mobile and i work at a certain fast food chicken place known for being open 6 days a week. 

so i was working drive-thru at work and it was about 9pm (we close at 10) and this guy pulls up to the terminal and i’m serving him and everything is all normal until he goes “and give me the white sauce” 

me: do you mean the cheese sauce?

male karen: no i want the white sauce! it’s in the container!

well that is no help to me as all our sauces come in a container, so i check to see if maybe he wants ranch sauce or possibly other tan colored sauces. after saying no to all of them he goes

male karen: it doesn’t come in a packet it comes in a container!!

at this point it’s been about 90 seconds of this banter and i’m fairly certain it’s the cheese sauce he wants, although the cheese is more yellow than white. 

finally we come to a conclusion that it is in fact the cheese sauce that he most desires. but that is after he got quite angry and just was shouting the same thing to me over and over. i truly hope he never goes on a game show where he has to describe something because he really wasn’t the best at it

tl:dr man just says the same thing over and over and gets more angry when i don’t understand what he wants",lobsman12,tfys
27,"no, i am not on the menu","tl;dr at the bottom

this happened a few months ago but i ran into an old coworker yesterday and he reminded me of this story and i thought it fit here.

i’ve worked in food service (foh &amp; boh) since i was 14 and i have my share of ridiculous/awful/sexist etc customers but this is one of the few that grossed me out so much that i took a shower as soon as i got home to physically wash the creepiness off of me.

up until a few months ago i was working as a hostess in a small mom &amp; pop diner. the way the my job worked meant that in addition to seating customers and preparing take out orders, customers would come up to the host stand to pay for their meals as well. 

the day in question was relatively slow, and i was working the 12-close shift, and the incident took place around 3:30, in between the lunch rush and the early bird dinner rush. most of our customers were regulars, and one of my favorite regulars, an older man named andy, came in with another man (willy) at his usual time, and i sat them in andy’s favorite spot, a booth at the opposite end of the restaurant.

i’m on friendly terms with andy so i make small talk with him while i seat him and willy and bring them their drinks because their server was nowhere to be found (the degree of laziness of the servers here could be its own post). i list off some of our daily specials for willy’s benefit, since they’re the same every week so andy already knows them and when i finish, willy gives me this unnerving smile that didn’t reach his eyes and said “those sound great, but are you sure you’re not on the menu?” 

okay, gross but nothing i’m not used to, so i smile and laugh awkwardly before telling them that i’ll send their server right over. for the rest of their meal, every time i swing by their table, either to give them refills or bus their plates, willy manages to make some awkward or sexual remark to me including “your skin looks like cream, i’ve always liked sweet irish girls.” (i’m pale with freckles) 

by the end of their meal, i’m throughly grossed out by willy and slightly disappointed in andy for not saying anything to his friend, but it’s not that big of a deal. except for when they come up to the host stand to pay. 

i split their check and andy pays without incident, but when i give willy his total and reach out to take his card he grabs my hand and yanks my arm forward, forcing me to lean more than halfway over the counter. 

“i thought you said you had a fiancé?” (i don’t, but sometimes i lie and say i do when guys get too sexually aggressive towards me when i’m working) 

“i don’t see a ring on that lovely finger of yours, you weren’t lying to old willy were you?” at this point he’s stroking my hand and my arm and i am choking back revulsion. willy was easily 40 years my senior and at the time only had about half of his teeth. 

i managed to keep my game face on and told him i don’t wear my ring at work because i don’t want it to get damaged or lost, and i gently but firmly pull my hand out of his grasp so i can run his card. after i handed him his receipt, he managed to stroke my hand again and winked at me before he and andy left. when i was closing out their tickets a few minutes, i saw that willy had written down his phone number on his receipt with the note “for my delicious hostess” 

i’ve gotten a lot of gross comments while working foh, but something about that interaction left me wanting to scrub the places on my arm where he touched me raw. and apparently, according to my coworkers, he came back on his own a few times after that when i wasn’t working and asked the servers and hosts what my last name was, what my schedule was, and if i lived in the area. thankfully none of them told him and i left that job (for a number of reasons) a few weeks afterwards so i never had to interact with him again but now at my new job i’m a lot more conscious of my body and proximity to others when i’m interacting with customers. 

tl;dr gross old man decides best way to hit on his hostess is to accuse her of lying, forcefully stroke her arm, and then question her coworkers about her personal life.",pnwhomebody,tfys

29,on pea crabs and crabby tourists [long and over-written],"this story was relayed to me by the entertaining bartenders at a very popular new england oyster bar.  

&amp;#x200b;

they had a co-worker who one could only describe as old-school; he had a depression-era mentality about food waste, and would regularly eat cornbread that was on its way to the trash despite this establishment having it in endless supply and letting staff snack on it whenever they wanted anyhow.  this sets the stage for an incredible interaction with a customer who did not like the free snack that came with their oysters.  

&amp;#x200b;

now for a melville-like aside on marine biology:  [pea crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pea_crab) are, as the name suggests, pea-sized crabs that often take up residence inside the mantle cavity (the mantle is the curtain-like outer part of the soft body of an oyster, responsible for depositing calcium on the shell and growing the shell) of oysters.  they are perfectly harmless, and their presence in an oyster is not an indication of the quality or freshness of an oyster, only an indication that oysters come from the ocean and that the ocean, like many dangerous and exciting things, has crabs.  the especially salty among us just eat the pea crabs when they find them, which is really no different from eating the oyster they're in except for a little crunch.

&amp;#x200b;

now the tourists who frequent this restaurant are perfectly ignorant of all this, of course.  this is amateur hour all day every day - often this is their first raw bar.  you see where this is going: a customer gets a pea crab in their oyster and gets ready to call the health department, nasa, and the national enquirer about the contamination.  our server, ever the problem solver, simply looks at the plate of oysters, points to the crab, and asks, ""you don't want it?""  the customer replies in the extreme affirmative, and then he simply reaches in, picks it out, eats it on the spot, and walks away, assuming everyone has gotten what they wanted from the exchange.  

&amp;#x200b;

i further heard that he was eventually let go, not for this, but for taking home a bottle of wine every night for more years than you'd think you can do that.  

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr:  customer complains of pea crab in oyster; server sees this as a feature, not a bug, reaches in, eats the crab, and continues his day assuming everyone has gotten what they wanted.",Pays_in_snakes,tfys

i had made a couple of stupid mistakes and was feeling real down on myself. i hadn’t been getting good tips all night and at this point i just wanted to go home and sleep forever. i was rushing around trying to stay on top of everything and this one couple at one of my booths just huddled over and whispering to each other while glancing at me every so often. my first thought was “oh great they think i’m awful and are debating on whether to stiff me or not”.  i try to move on from it and just focus on my other tables and try to make a little bit of money from a pretty bad night. 

when i came back to pick up their check i almost started bawling right in the middle of my section. under where i wrote “thank you!” on their check they had written “no, thank you” and they had made the other copy into a little origami crane that said “you’re awesome” on the wings.

today the stiffers have haunted me long into the night after my shift was over.

my coworker, we'll call him kevin, served them this time. having never served them before, poor, sweet kevin poured his little heart out to the family and waited on them beck and call, until the check came. the eldest daughter, a total fucking karen, was bitching about her bill. it was a medium pizza to go and a diet coke, apparently she didn't order the diet coke.

that bitch was empty as fuck right in front of her.

karen demanded it be taken off her bill, and sweet kevin did as he was asked, completely confused.

kevin did not get tipped.

**tldr; karen complains about a paying for a drink she ordered and then drank.**

for real though, every time this family comes in, they become more entitled and more ridiculous in their requests. i've had them about 3 times now, once they got upset with me when i charged them for extra ranch after they asked me for **4 large sides of it** on top of the 2 they already get. i've even had them send back and make us remake an entire salad because it didn't come out with their pizza, after i asked if they wanted it as an app or with their meal. why they are still allowed to come in, beats the fuck out of me.",savvymonster,tfys

37,im a hostess and need advice for drama between servers,"i know alot of people in this group tend to resent hostesses, and i don't mean to brag but i get alot of compliments from (most) of the servers because i'm good about following rotation, telling people no when i need to, etc. however i need some help because it's well known that a good portion of the servers are outright bullies to each other and especially to whoever is hosting 😕 

we dont have a computer system for seating so everything is done on paper. so even where the table assignments of where their sections are supposed to go is on paper. this is usually done by the morning host. three weeks in a row one server has erased someone else's name and wrote her own name and stolen her section. it caused such an argument the last time this happened that i had to grab my manager and get it sorted out and it caused a line of about 30 or so people to form (i cant seat anyone until i know who is going where)

they blame me for a lot of things that are out of my control. some sections are going to be less popular than others and may even vary depending on the day, they know this, that is why their sections rotate (duh). they accuse me of skipping them when seating people but within reason i have to seat people where they want (for example, our outdoor spots are generally more popular). they will come right up to me with attitude and make rude comments whether it's in front of customers or not. i have even seen them cuss each other out. 

now most of them are not that bad but the ones that are, are really bad. i am not sure what to say to make them stop. the manager is aware of how they are since most of the servers have been there more than a decade or at least several years (we are somewhat upscale and they can take home 300-500 in tips a night so turnover is low) but we are union and at times it's hard to do anything about their behavior. i am super new, only been there a month, and i'm not assertive so i'm somewhat of an easy target for their childishness. to be honest, unless i'm at an extreme boiling point, i usually just freeze up if someone is being mean to me. if anyone had any advice on things to say or do to put them in their place but still be professional it would be appreciated 🙁",starwishes20,tfys

this older couple comes in and sits at the bar. first they complain that the bar is too dark (first of all, we’re an upscale fine dining restaurant, it’s not gonna be bright in here) but besides that, it was nowhere near “un-seeable” like they said.  i offered to brighten the bar lights just a little bit, and they said that’s fine.

so i brighten the lights ever so slightly, so not to make it too bright for our atmosphere. they then said to me “oh no, we meant that there’s no light underneath the bar where our feet are!”

excuse me but......what? we do have lights underneath the bar, but not a second row where the feet would be.

they then said, “looking in from the outside, your restaurant looks closed because you don’t have light for the feet area at the bar! you need to fix that!”

wtf could i say? i just apologized and went back to work.

i feel as if their fear is to not see where they’re stepping and take a fall, but to go as far as to complain this much about it, is just plain obnoxious.

43,what a horrible day.,"my restaurant just recently started serving breakfast. before we were just a typical open at 11am until 2am  with a full bar, we're the local spot for late night party goers which is what i'm used to and only like to do, night cocktail serve.

i told them i didn't want anything to do with breakfast, which starts at 7am, not a morning person at all. they were cool with it. they actually hired a whole new staff just for breakfast cuz its an entire different breed of work. especially since many of us refuse it and just want to stay nights. 

well, they last minute remodified my schedule to work not only breakfast today, but also at night, a horrendous double. i haven't even been trained on breakfast they just threw me on. couldn't get it covered, i knew it was gonna be a shit show for me and that's exactly what it was. 

we got busy. were talking like as busy as it gets on a friday night, but around 8am in the morning. wtf. so i had to learn as i went. barely know the breakfast menu or how to ring stuff in. there's a lot of modifications you have to type in for orders. gm was constantly yelling at me for ringing in stuff wrong and i'm like dude, i have no training on this and this is actually against my availability so why am i even here? we also have to give out french press coffee to every table so getting drinks and shit takes longer than normal. it felt like i was working in an entire different restaurant.

some of my tables understood. they would ask me questions i can't answer, so i would say, ""i'm sorry, this is my first breakfast shift and haven't been trained for it, they just threw me on. i'm mainly a night server but i'll go find out for you."" some even felt real bad for me cuz they could tell how frustrated i was. others though were impatient and annoyed. 

the other servers who've done breakfast were a big help but we got so busy they cant be on the spot to help. because lunch also starts at 11am and breakfast is until 1pm so now you're getting people for both coming in. a total of almost 250 people i'm that 6am to 1pm time frame. it was chaotic. then only had a 30 min break for my 4pm dinner shift. and the money was only okay, i can make the same doing what i normally and comfortably do at night. 

i'm physically exhausted and mentally drained, because i also worked late last night and got like 4 hours of sleep. i told the manager who makes the schedule never to do that to me again or they will lose one of their best servers. i specialise in the night crowd, not the morning. thats not my niche. 

sorry if i seem whiney. just needed to rant.

when i first got in the industry ten years ago, my motto was ""never let them see you sweat."" well today, they saw me sweat. like crazy. let me preface this by saying i made a post a bit ago about how busy south by southwest was. psssh! i have never seen it so busy than it was today for brunch. i worked the bar section today which has about 12-15 tables.  not that big a deal but, like most bar sections, it's open seating. when there is nowhere to sit in the main dining room, the hostess just tells people to sit in the bar.

 have you ever been dodeca sat before? i don't even know if that's the right term cause i've never had to use it but that's what happened! the entire room went from having three people to every table being filled all at once, plus an 8 top in the back. i was by myself and was trying to get to people in the order i noticed them sit down. i've never had so many people waving me down, asking for coffee and just trying to get me to their table.

 one man in particular, waved me down about three times and i told him i'd be right with him. when i finally got to him to take his order, he didn't even know what he wanted! i was so frustrated and it definitely showed. he said i sounded 'nervous'. i told him i wasn't, that i'm just trying my best to help everyone and i could give him a couple more minutes to decide if he wanted. but instead he just wanted to not read the menu and ask if we had certain items. benedict? yessir, it's right here on the menu. eggs? yessir, here on the menu. do you have oatmeal? cue me screaming internally. another woman said i seemed flustered when she asked for her latte a second time. all i had said in response was ""yes, i'm so sorry. it'll be right out"" 

 i'm just so disappointed that i let it so obviously show that i was overwhelmed but guys i was drowning. i straight up told my manager that people were being neglected and i needed help. it wasn't until the bartender and another manager came to help me with drinks and greeting people that i was able to catch up. i usually keep my cool in these situations but i can't stop thinking about how my frustrations showed so openly. maybe it was how impatient people were being..i don't know. i'm disappointed in my service and i just can't get over it.

46,customer stiffs then finds my facebook,"ugh... guys.

so last night i had an 11-top, 4 top, and then got seated with a 2 top. 

definitely not the busiest i've been but my 11 was somewhat needy so i did have to give them a lot of attention and was somewhat flustered. my 4 top was standard, nice people, not very chatty, didn't need much. then i get this lovely little two top, a dad and his super sweet daughter. honestly i kind of needed them because i needed a bit of pep.

the daughter was soooo sweet, super shy but was admiring my very bright pink hair, so i told her that it was a shampoo and she could get it at our local beauty supply. i emphasize, super nice table. so imagine my surprise when i get their ticket (i had been a bit busy closing out the 4 tickets on my 11 and trusted the 2 top would pay) and he had left only $21 on a $31.xx ticket. when they got up, i had seen them putting cash down and even in the middle of being busy i asked them if they'd like me to grab them change, he said no so now i know why.

i was pretty disappointed, but whatever, not the first time this has happened to me, i just asked my manager to comp off some of the ticket so i could at least not lose the whole $10. i honestly couldn't believe they would do that at first, looked my whole section and walk for the $10 i must have dropped, tried to reason that he must have read it as 21, (but that would still have stiffed even the change) but our tickets are definitely concise and the total check is decently large on the receipt. 

this man had the audacity to find my facebook (the pink hair doesn't help me keep a low profile lol), send me a message request and ask where to buy the product and it's name!!!!!! man!!! i'm pretty upset about it. i'm a good server, i really am, and i love having nice tables and sweet kids, but this whole situation really bummed me out.",listentolions,tfys
47,what are your doubles like?/ rant,"i work in a large entertainment type venue and i’m a waitress there. we get slammed on the weekends and in order to keep the place run smoothly when it’s that busy is we need a large amount of staff. i have open availability and that basically means i work the entire weekend. i worked about 35 hours in the span of three days. saturday was the worst, i worked literally 18 hours straight. i was extremely nonstop busy for 15 hours of it. even on doubles we don’t get a break in between our shifts. if we want to sit down and shove food in our face we have to find 5 minutes of our own time when we can leave our tables unattended. these kind of shifts leave me so physically and emotionally drained and i had to be back at work the next morning. even if we are dog sick and we are on a wait they won’t let us go home. they would rather us cough and sneeze on our tables then let a small section close on a wait. i love my job don’t get me wrong but it always makes me wonder why the restaurant industry is the only industry that somehow manages to skate by on this stuff. they can get away with paying us literally slave wages and horrible hours with no breaks. and we can’t complain because this is the restaurant industry it’s just how it is. i wasn’t the only one at my job who had a weekend like this most of us did and we just have to accept it as a way of life. customers don’t realize as we are smiling and handing them their food and dealing with their complains we are literally starving because we haven’t eaten for 8 hours we are
running on 5 hours of sleep, our feet hurt because we have been running around for hours, and our bladders hurt because we haven’t found a spare minute to pee yet. why not get a new job you ask? because sadly this is the only job that pays my bills.

48,customer gets mad because i charged him correctly.,"a bit of background. i attend a university in the south that has a very prominent diverse community. the place i work at is a university dining hall, and your meal plan defines how many meals you get through the week. i'm a 5’ 9” fat white boy who works cashier/server for long hours and weekends to pay my phone bill and to repair my broken car. yb=young boi. yb is a 6’ 3” dark-skinned male football player with a muscular build.

it was an average sunday at work. i was swiping people in, and since it was the day before the meal swipes reset for the week, a lot of people had to pay with the university's version of currency, cash or card. then, at about half an hour before my shift ends, yb walked in and gave me his id to swipe him in for his meal. he was out of meal swipes, so the following conversation took place:


me: i'm sorry, but you're out of meal swipes. would you like to pay with cash, card, or university bucks?

yb: aight, university bucks.


so i complete the transaction (about $7.50), and as the machine was printing the receipt, he got a mad look on his face as he looks at the display on the opposite side of the register.


yb: why did you you charge me as a guest when i'm a student? i gave you my student id.

me: oh, it just says “guest pass.” there technically isn't a “student meal-”

yb: you over here tryna overcharge me and shit i mean what the fuck bro? 

me: i'm sorry, but i don't understand. i didn't over charge yo-

yb: you see this is what the fuck is wrong with this university! you here overcharging me! why didn't you just give me a fucking student meal? i'm not a guest.

me: i properly charged you the money, there is no stu-

yb: no! i been having problems with you white people here, you're racist as fuck! i remember you gave me a burnt burger (it was a month ago, and it wasn't burnt. it took me a few minutes to remember this encounter) tryna tell me it's the same as the rest of them! 

me: sir, please calm down. you're making a scene.

yb: man fuck (insert university acronym)! this place is all fucked up. gimme my fucking id back (*reaches over the counter to snatch his id and receipt out of my hand*). you better hope we don't meet again or i'm gonna fuck you up.

me: please enjoy your food. the police are on their way.


i never ended up calling the cops, i'd figured it wasn't worth the hassle. i told the manager on duty and my lead, but by the time they came back to the register he had already enjoyed his food and left. sometimes i wonder if the money they pay is even worth it.",jasonjenkins67,tfys
49,manager refuses to cut me on a slow sunday,"i opened today at 10:45 am and was scheduled a double, which i do every sunday. i was in a section for the dinner shift that usually gets cut first - and considering i open and am always a double, i usually expect to be the first cut, which is usually the case. not today apparently! manager decided to be petty and keep my partner and i on an additional hour til just now (10pm) when we had no tables in our section. he was obviously being petty/childish because earlier i asked if i could have a small break and if i could order something to eat (this was around 5pm, the dinner rush hadn't started yet nor did it ever start since we stayed slow) and he told me no. this made me pretty pissed, and i was already pretty hangry, so i said ""whatever, guess i won't eat then."" and that must have set him off. 

while we typically don't get breaks, as they are optional and most servers want to stay on for the extra money, the fact that i actually wanted one today and was refused for no real reason just really doesn't rub me right. i'm pretty much always on time, never call out, and work doubles every weekend for them because we're usually short staffed. i haven't asked for a break in maybe a year now, and i only did today because we were pretty slow and i wasn't making money. needless to say he is now my least favourite manager lmao.",kelpoh,tfys

(through the years i have thought of the many ways i could respond to this remark). the look on his face was priceless it was like i was looking at a real life pikachu meme. i paused for what must have felt like forever to him and asked the group if they wanted anything to drink. guy didn't look me in the eyes for the rest of the night and the table got awkwardly quiet every time i approached. they tipped 20%. i hope he learned a lesson. shout out to the people who ask me where i'm from instead of questioning my name.",JuanOnOne,tfys

2 other things:

1-- i'm assuming it was a family of 3- mom, dad, son. they somehow forgot to order her a meal and by the time she realised their mistake, she said she wouldn't bother ordering. so it was mother's day, and mom didn't get a nice meal. but the dad sure did. i don't blame her if she was in a sour or disappointed mood for the rest of the day!!!!!!!!! i'd be like, ""so is it fuckin father's day or son's day? i must've been confused when i woke up this morning."" rofl

and 2-- some glam-queens came in, and i'd say the mom was the most beautiful and most confident. it was like she wore the clothes, while her daughters' clothes wore them and they weren't super at ease like she was. if that's one of the things that comes with age, sign me up for an earlier train, baby. they basically reminded me of the more stylish real housewives the way they were dressed. i wanted to compliment them but i didn't want other customers to hear me and then feel like i needed to give a lame compliment to them as well... and have it just be hanging in the air that i didn't think they were as tricked out as the glam-queens. so i'll just mention it here.",ThrowAwayEh3566,tfys
53,mild means not spicy...,"first-time poster here!

so last year i worked for a mexican restaurant, and we served two types of salsas: regular and mild. generally we only served the regular salsa to customers unless they specifically asked for mild, but when families with children sat down, most of us servers would bring out some mild right off the bat for the kiddos.

anyway, i found myself in just such a situation when two women and their two children were sat in my section. i grabbed a bowl of chips, filled up two cups of regular salsa and two cups of mild, and made my way over to the table.

cl: clueless lady; me: uh, myself

me: hi there, my name is calody and i'll be your server today. i went ahead and brought out two regular salsas (i gesture at the regulars) and two milds (gestures at milds).

54,the time a customer told the cashier next to me that she liked him better,"i worked at a ren fair food booth years ago and the lines would get really ridiculous and chaotic.

this one lady, all very dressed up in her period costume, was annoyed at the line situation and projected it onto me and was complaining. you could tell it was a really special thing for her.

out of all the other food booths ours seemed to get the most slammed and sometimes there would be big delays in getting the food out so people would have to wait an extra 10, 15 min. there were no receipts, no tickets, no cash registers. just cash tils and pure chaos with us shouting the orders into the kitchen windows.

and then the lines would dissolve into a mob of people pretty frequently.

so after complaining at me, the lady goes up to the cashier guy right next to me and says ""i like you a lot better."" i guess because he really sucked up to her to get her to calm down.

57,"plastic is bad for the environment, you know.","this happened a few months ago when i was still working as a supervisor at a smoothie bar. 

i’m working away with my coworker on a busy saturday, making lots of smoothies and serving a bunch of little treats (cookies, muffins, etc.) we have a bit of a lull after the lunch rush, and my coworker goes to the back to do some dishes. then in walk two ladies in their 60s. 

they order without incident (though they do ask an excessive number of questions). i make both of their smoothies and grab the chocolate bites they ordered and pop them into a paper bag. 

as i’m cashing them out i mention that they can grab straws for their smoothies on their side of the counter. that’s when one of the ladies launches into a tirade about how plastic straws are horrible for the environment and that i should be ashamed of myself to be providing their smoothies in plastic cups with plastic straws. i agreed with her that plastic wasn’t the most environmentally friendly option, but that unfortunately i didn’t have a say in the types of cups and straws we stocked. i mentioned that we happily pour smoothies into jars or tumblers brought in by customers, and that we even give a discount for it, but she wasn’t listening. just going on and on. meanwhile her friend is saying nothing. 

finally she stops educating me on the dangers of plastic and goes with her friend to sit outside. i think that interaction is over with, and tell my coworker all about it when she comes back to the front. 

fast forward to 15 minutes later, when she comes back inside and asks me if i have plastic wrap. 

me, confused and cautious: ”pastic wrap?”

plastic lady, impatiently: “yes. plastic wrap.”

me, still cautious: “i believe we do have some in the kitchen, yes.”

plastic lady, imperiously: “well i’m going to need you to go get some.”

me, confused: “may i ask why?”

plastic lady, even more impatiently: “this paper bag you gave me to hold these chocolate bites is getting oily. there’s no way i could put it in my purse like this. i need these bites individually wrapped in plastic and put into a new paper bag.”

me, in shock: “... um... ok, yes. you want me to use more plastic. right, let me take that from you.”

i go ahead and do what she asked, barely biting my tongue. when i’m finished i hand her the new bag. 

me, in my friendliest customer service voice: “here you go. two bites individually wrapped in plastic in a new paper bag, as requested.”

plastic lady, rudely: “it’s about time.” 

they leave. 

my coworker and i burst out laughing. 

i think about this lady’s hypocrisy often and smile.

62,long story/rant about douchebag 5 hour energy sales guy...,"2006ish. phoenix, az. 5 hour energy had really not ever been heard of at this time. red bull was really picking up steam at this point though. i was working at a mid level chain restaurant. picture a steakhouse that is a step above your typical tgi bennigardenbees. we had a patio with 10 two top tables that could not be moved, so it was kinda limited in use. we only used it for private events and busy weekend nights. i loved working the private events and could upsell extremely well, so management loved to have me work those events. needless to say, i was pretty stoked to see someone booked 6 consecutive monday nights for private events since typically i'd make 100-150 off those parties and it was an easy in and out shift.

i show up the first monday and meet sales douchebag guy(db). right away i knew this was gonna be bad just by the way he started talking to me. ""hey, boss! so you're gonna be my right hand man for then next six weeks i hear?"" then proceeds to hand me menus that he made himself that drastically limits our menu down to all the lesser priced items, but he wants me to pass them out as if they were coming from the restaurant. not too big a deal, we've done stuff like this in the past for large groups. then he proceeds to tell me that he only wants me in the patio twice. once to take the orders, then once to pass out the food and then disappear. no refills, no anything else. it seems really odd, but ok, that's cool i guess cause it's less work for me. the first night goes off smoothly from my end and i'm wondering what exactly is going on out there. people come out looking either excited or a little confused and it's just really a weird dynamic as they all trickle out of the restaurant. i bring out the bill and this is where db drops a bomb on me. he pays the tab and tells me that if i do a great job all six weeks just like that night, he'll tip me really well at the end. i do not like this. i do not like this at all. typically anyone that says they will tip you well does not tip really well. its what we refer to in the industry as a ""verbal tip"". 

3 of these weeks go by and everything goes off without a hitch, but i finally get a chance to talk to one of the guests. turns out he is doing hard sales pitches to distributors, entrepreneurs, and anyone else who might buy 5 hour energy in bulk. yup, 5 hour energy is an mlm gimmick that people bought right into and many many people are rich because people are/were dumb enough to buy a tiny bottle of stuff with caffeine in it for like 3 bucks.

so anyway, jump to the end of the 6 week stint and db finally tips me. now mind you that each night's food totals were roughly 20 people x 20 dollars. so about 4-500/night. which at the low end of tipping is 60/night, so 360 for 6 nights would be acceptable, but low. the guy pays the final bill and takes a crisp 100 dollar bill out of his pocket and hands it to me like he's making me a fucking millionaire with his amazingly gracious tip. i literally didn't say a word and just walked away biting my tongue not to call the guy out on all the levels of douchebaggery that he represents. 

so, not really that great a story overall, but i just kinda wanted to vent and let you know the type of people who got rich off that 5 hour energy drink garbage. 

tl;dr - 5 hour energy high pressure salesman is a douchebag and tips me shitty for 6 weeks of work.",NISCBTFM,tfys

our systems were down in the back, so i had to clock in on a front counter register.  i was scheduled to work there anyway, so i just walked up to do it on my own machine and assign it to myself.  before i quite reached it, a family approaches.  i let them know that my register is not open yet, and will take a few minutes, but they're welcome to order at the next register (co-worker is standing there waiting).  husband begins barking his own complicated order (substitutions galore) at me, face in his phone, completely ignoring me, so i grab a pen, rip off some receipt paper, and write it all down quickly so i don't forget what to enter when the system is ready.  i repeat his order back and am met with an eye roll and sigh, as he confirms it.  i ask a few standard questions (drink choice, side choice, etc.) and he keeps walking away as i'm talking to him, then having to come back and give another eye roll and sigh before each answer.  when i have his details i let him know ""okay, you're all set sir, thank you!"" and he lopes off across the restaurant to a table.  i deal with these types a lot, so i really didn't give it much thought.  wife and kids order without an issue, not rude, not friendly, just fast and efficiently before joining him.  my machine is finally ready, so i enter it all in.  i ask for a name for the order and, not even kidding, she says ""karen"".

15 minutes later, i check on the dining room, ask the family if everything came out correctly, and if they need anything  karen's husband is still engrossed in his phone and doesn't acknowledge, kids nod happily, karen gives a quiet ""we're fine"" but as i walk away, begins to follow me.  i didn't notice until i rounded a corner.  she taps me on the shoulder and asks to speak to a manager.  ""absolutely, let me find one for you."". i look for one, while trying to think of what might possibly be wrong, and prepare to apologise and correct it.

when the manager arrives, karen is standing near the kitchen entrance where i left her, and she launches.  not at me, but at the ""absolutely disgusting and unacceptable behavior of my husband."". falls all over herself apologizing for him, and gushes to my manager over the way i'd handled it ""she never stopped smiling or being polite!  i hope you keep her here as long as possible!"" etc.

it's been days and i'm still smiling about it.  karen, if you're out there, i wish you the best, and you deserve so much better.

woman: can i speak to your manager?
girl: i am the manager.
woman: oh....it's just you two today?

69,evyrthing is better in america,"this happened about two years ago but i'll try to include as many details as i can remember.

&amp;#x200b;

i live in germany and during my summer break from university i worked in a small, old cinema in a small town. i mostly worked the snack station in the front (aka i prepare your snacks, sold the tickets, took reservations, cleaned and made sure everything was stocked) but most of our drinks were served inside the rooms. you would go to your seat, press a button and one of us would scurry to your seats and take your drink orders and prepare them at the bar in the back. so you got your drinks in actual glasses with ice, if you were 18+ you could actually get alcoholic berverages.

we did not have a soda fountain and we did not have big papercups to pour drinks into. the usual serving size was 0.33 litre for soda. there were no smaller or bigger sizes. the most popular popcorn flavour in germany is also sweet. not caramel, just sweet. salty popcorn can usually only be found in big chain cinemas in big cities.

&amp;#x200b;

one day a man (a regular i had seen plenty of times before), his wife and a random woman wearing a bald eagle shirt which i don't recognise walk in. i greet them, sell them tickets and since it was a slow day (we would fight over who got to do the next task because we were bored af) my colleague was eager to handle the sale of snacks while i took reservations for that evening. i'm not paying attention to my colleague until i hear someone yell in english: ""what do you mean they can't sell me a bigger soda?!""  
the regular tries talking to the woman i didn't know in english to the best of his abilities and my colleague motions for me to help.   
putting on my best smile, i walk over and ask in german and english whether i can be of any help. the woman (henceforth we shall refer to her as aw) turns and continues yelling at me how she wants a gallon\* of coke. i tell her that we only offer this one serving size but she is free to order multiple of those throughout the movie. she goes off on a little rant about how stingy germans are with soda which i ignore because i get it. it's weird being in a foreign country and adjusting to everything around you. no need to be an ass but whatever.  
my colleague has noped out at this point. she's disappeared into the back and i can't blame her because that poor girl had only started working there two days earlier.  
it's at this point that the regular already starts profusely apologising. aw is some very distant relative who got in touch with them when she discovered she still had relatives in germany and because they seemed to get along they decided to host her for a while and show her around the area some common ancestors had originated from. i tell him it's fine and him and his wife should just get to their seats. i literally tell him that i got this.

i return to take her order. she wants salted popcorn. we do not have salted popcorn and i say as much. she asks me why and i tell her that it's just not as popular in germany hence we don't make it.

""then go make some.""

i explain to her why that is not possible (we only have one machine which would have to be cleaned in order to make salted popcorn. for which we also lack supplies etc.).

aw is not having it. she keeps going on and on and on about how germans are stingy and weird. how we clearly have no taste in food (to her defense: the area this cinema was in and that i am also from is not known for its amazing cuisine.). of course, i'm getting annoyed but when dealing with customers you have to have that unwavering smile plastered on your face and just silently swear in your mind.

she eventually settles for nachos with cheese (not without complaining about or ""tiny"" serving sizes) and gets to her seat where she proceeds to order a coke. surprise, surprise: she only ordered one bottle of coke. guess the 0.33 l were enough after all.  
accoring to my colleague who served her drink she made it a point to tell her that she would not be tipping. bohoo. we get paid 8€ minimum wage per hour and don't have to rely on tips for survival. anyone who works full-time earns more than that. you only tip if you think the service was good and you can afford to do that.

during the pre-movie ads the regular comes out again and continues apologising. again, my colleague and i tell him it's fine and that we're sorry he has to deal with her more frequently.

&amp;#x200b;

on the way out aw stopped by the snack station again to tell me that she would not tip (bummer. i'm about to cry, lady.) and america is the best (she didn't say that word for word but i don't recall her 5 minute speech on the matter). 

&amp;#x200b;

just to throw this out there before someone jumps to the conclusion: i know that not all americans are like that. i've had plenty of good encounters during my various part-time jobs in university. she just sticks out like a sore thumb alongside the guy who complained about his beer not tasting like bud light and wanting a refund (he didn't order bud light because we don't sell that.) or the lady thinking that a manager will automatically give her stuff for free.

&amp;#x200b;

\* a question about the gallon of coke: was she just making that serving size up? because that would be 3 litres of coke and i am worried because that's a lot.

70,customer has a melt down after not listening to my instructions and after i helped them,"not sure if it belongs here, but it's not retail and i am the worker so both r/talesfromretail r/talesfromthecustomer don't apply here.

i work at an independent seaside amusement park to help fund my living expenses at university, today i was on the dodgems (aka bumper cars) training a new guy. we were doing it for about 4 hours or so without any real issues or bad customers. 

about 3pm it starts to get a little busy, which isn't a problem for two people as it's usually only the one person up there regardless of how busy it gets. we have a load of young teens come on as well as a father, mother, and their child - they all get in separate dodgem cars. all is well for about 2 minutes, then then the father and child get stuck on the barrier side (it goes child's car -&gt; fathers car -&gt; barrier, so the kid's car is what's trapping them). neither of them can move, the cars are working regardless because i can see the sparks come off the metal grate above their heads and as the reflection of sparks underneath the car off the metal floor. i shout (i have to shout bc it's very loud when it's going) at the child to ""turn the wheel"" and motion as such, which is the solution to 9/10 problems we encounter, especially as i could see the kid wasn't turning it. the father starts getting angry, rapidly flaring his arms and shouting ""he fking is"" (i can see he clearly isn't), and shouting ""it's not fking working"". 

i stop the ride at this point as i realise it's easier to just pull the cars out than have to keep shouting or have to deal with a complaint. while i do this the father is still shouting profanities and what not after pulling them both out. i start the ride up again, and the kid's car isn't moving. the father then really loses his rag, almost screeching in anger, shouting real profanities. 

the issue now is the kid isn't pressing the pedal to move the dodgem, i can see this clear as daylight and shout over ""he's got to press the pedal"", the dad shouts back ""he fking is"" (he's clearly not because i can see his knees pointed up and kids' knees have to be straight to reach and then press the pedal). at this point i turn the ride off again so i can go over and reassure the child on how to operate the dodgem car, the dad has none of it, gets out of the car, drags his child off, and the mother gets out and leaves looking very embarrassed. 

this all happens while my coworker is standing there behind the operator desk with a ""what the fk is going on"" expression, i kinda feel bad for him as it's literally his first shift here and he's already had to deal with a random going apeshit. as well as feeling bad for the other customers who just wanted to enjoy the ride without it stopping several times and having to watch me deal with someone losing their shit.

i know this isn't the most entertaining of stories, but i was only just holding onto my rag by the end of it as i desperately wanted to tell him to stfu and just listen to what i was i saying.",dubbinblue,tfys
71,a strange story!,"long time lurker here and i finally have an odd enough experience to add! on mobile so i apologize ahead of time for formatting! long- tldr at the bottom!

this happened about a week ago and it starts as i’m driving to work. the road i take to work is pretty dead and normally, i do speed a little. i know it’s terrible but to be fair, i only was going 5 over the limit at this time (50 in a 45). anyways, the road is clear and i’m about to make it to the light when a white dirty van pulls out of a nearby community complex into the lane next to me. as i’m in the turn lane at the light he pulls up next to me and proceeds to roll down his window. as it’s happening i’m thinking well shiz something is wrong with my car so i roll my window down to talk to him. he then proceeds to tell me how i was speeding and how it’s not safe to speed and blah blah blah. at this point i’m now thinking well shiz this dude is an undercover creepy cop trying to give me a heads up (this ends up not being the case as the inside of the van doesn’t look very copish). he also says i’m too cute to speed and that he thought i must’ve been an old lady who didn’t know how to drive (i was not driving crazily and i would consider my driving more than decent compared to other floridian drivers).  this conversation takes maybe 10 seconds and the light turns green and i continue. i’m a little frazzled by this encounter but go to work brushing it off. 

couple of hours into my shift i notice a dude by the bar booths waving and giving me strange eye contact as i’m greeting my table. i of course ignore this because i’m in front of guests and i’m not going to interrupt their service for some random dude. i end up forgetting about the guy and finish my tables up only to have a coworker tell me that his table wants to talk to me. my coworker does this in close proximity to the table so i can’t play it off and walk away. 

i approach the table and they guy immediately is like “hey! do you remember me?!” and i have no clue who this dude is until he tells me that’s he’s the same guy who was giving me a hard time on the road earlier. i don’t recognize him right away because the whole ordeal was seconds and so strange i didn’t take time to remember him. anyways, he goes on to tell me how cute i am and how he noticed me right away (this dude is well into his 50’s so i feel uncomfortable with the conversation for multiple reasons).  me being a friendly and an awkward person, i continues to talk to this dude and inch away from the table. he then tries to set me up with his son and proceeds to ask if i have a boyfriend and if my boyfriend is “big”. i tell him yes i do have a bf but he just continues to ask if he’s “big” like his son and how i should really give his son a chance. poor kid is red and so embarrassed and eventually i’m able to end the conversation by changing the subject to college. the van dude doesn’t like how we’re done talking about me and his son so i’m able to get away shortly after. 

weird experience and by far the strangest that has happened to me so far! 

tldr: creepy van dude tells me that i’m a speedster and ends up hours later at the restaurant i work at and tries to set me up with his son.",o0olainao0o,tfys
72,i just got my first job as a bus boy and i need advice!,i’m a 14 yr old and i just got my first job at a busy restaurant as a bus boy. today was my first day on the job and it was really hard for me to keep up with the fast pace and memorize tables. how do you get better at this job quickly? thank you for reading :) ,willowwyleman,tfys
73,so my coworker got a raise and i didn’t... what should i do?,"i am a host (and food runner some nights since i’m cross-trained) at a very busy and urban mexican restaurant. i have been here since june of last year. this place has consistently been understaffed since i started, and while our “staffed” staffing would probably be around twelve hosts and a couple food runners for busy nights, we’ve consistently hovered around seven except for a time period around christmas when we hired three (all of which have quit since then). 

so, let’s call my coworker dale. dale has been here since july of last year and is a good host. our boss has even had us shift lead before. i would say that dale and i are about equal in our overall abilities and work ethic, and i think most of the staff thinks this as well. we scored very similarly (high) on our employee evaluation. 

i started at this restaurant making $9 an hour plus tip-out, with one previous job before this (where i made the same wage + tip-out). while it is fairly good money, especially with me being in college, i learned from a host who left shortly after telling me this in october that every host is supposed to receive a raise after 90 days of employment. she had heard this from one of the previous managers that was there before i started. by october, i had been there for a little under five months. i was very distressed and frustrated by this, and this was the start of my overall frustration and burn-out with this company, my boss and this job.

i approached my assistant manager and asked what i could do to be considered for a raise. he told me that he really thought i deserved one, and that he would bring it up and push for it with my gm. for context, my assistant manager is very by the book and offers a lot of criticism, and i was actually really surprised with his immediate “yes”. but hey, it was very exciting, and i felt really appreciated! 

the very next day i was scheduled to work with my gm. my gm called me into the office before we opened, and was absolutely so rude about it, “you didn’t have to bring everyone else into this”, “you have so much you could improve on”, just berating me with criticism when i had never heard any of this prior to this meeting, and honestly it was stuff i know i’m good on, so i was very confused. he gave me the $1.00 raise anyway, and i soon found out that dale (who had started in august) received his due raise since it was his 90 days of employment, which i had no problem with at the time. 

so basically... everything went back to normal after that. honestly there is things with this job that are very frustrating... the servers are favorited by management.... the job is like literally doing all of the bs that the servers and management don’t wanna do... they scream at you one day then hug you the next.. but hey, it pays right?

well, things have been a little rocky the last month. i had a really bad shift with a lot of mistakes about two months ago, but i’ve redeemed myself a lot since then. we had an owner visit (our owner lives somewhere else in the state and only comes to see us maybe once every six months or so) .... and i did so much for this visit. i literally stayed after my shift for hours one night cleaning out and detailing our cleaning supply room that hadn’t been cleaned in months.. all of this i was happy to do because i was under the impression that harder work = better opportunities = more $. the gm and a few of the managers even told me that they noticed how much i did and thanked me for it. 

here’s where dale comes in. dale is a favorite of a few of our managers. dale is also a friend of mine and since it’s his first job, he didn’t know not to text me and tell me he got a raise on tuesday. to $11 an hour (for context we were both at $9.50). i didn’t go back to work until thursday... and the shift went on as expected.. without me receiving a raise. like i said, dale started a couple months after i did, and actually didn’t show up for a shift last month but is still employed and still receiving raises.

to be honest, i think dale deserves the raise because he’s a hard worker. but it also feels like i accept so much absolute bullshit from this place (as some of my former coworkers have put it in conversations we’ve had after they left).... to not even be appreciated for the fact that i contribute a lot to the business. i have a regular couple that comes in just to see me that came with me from my last restaurant. i receive high praise from my fellow hosts and the servers and don’t ever really receive any criticism from management unless he’s in a really bad mood. but then again, i don’t ever really receive any praise but the only ones that do are the managers favorites... even if they suck at their job.

i’ve went and applied at some jobs the past few months, have done some window shopping... even had one job ask me what they could do to make me come work for them.. but i think the fear to change and the familiarity of this place keep me there. i also really love some of my coworkers, even my manager sometimes, and the job is super flexible (which i need since i’m in college). but then the other part of me feels really underappreciated and disrespected. i’ve gotten to where i hate my job.. i’m just bored with it and honestly the only thing that makes me happy are the coworkers and the customers... so if a coworker is having a bad day it kind of ruins mine (which i know is a personal thing).

so what is my best next step? find something else, or approach my boss are what i see as my two options. both are really scary lol!

74,why do people think its funny to tip servers 10%?,"let me start by saying this is more than a rant. i work as foh manager in a well to do neighborhood, full of luxury condos and apartments that houses many international folks. a majority of these folks are from spain, which i know isn't a country that's used to tipping. that's fine, we realize this and just bite the bullet whenever they come in ($5-10 on a $100 bill usually). they're usually polite and don't give us too much trouble anyways. 

but today while doing a round i over heard one paying table where a young woman whispered something about a 10% tip and then giggled with her friends. i walked over and quickly asked about their meal, how was the service, if they are unsatisfied, etc. they all told me the meal was great and everything is good, so i just left it at that. i asked my server how was the table and server also said fine.

i checked the tip after they left, $10 for a $112 bill.

i get that you don't wanna tip a lot if it's not in your culture, fine. or if you have some issues this month transferring your parents money to pay for the luxury condos, that's fine too. but don't laugh when youre knowingly tipping my servers like shit... i hate this job sometimes :/",I_Only_Post_NEAT,tfys
75,don't ever do tip pool. another week of me getting screwed over.,"i work at a casual restaurant as a bartender. average check for two people ranges from $80 to $100. we do tip pool, and also have a tip out of 5.5% on total sales including tax. no idea where this money goes because we have one support staff for weekends.

last saturday i worked a double that included a party of 30 during the day (served them alone, while still being the only bartender for the entire restaurant). my end of the night cashout was: sales $5152; total tips $930; tip out $262; meaning $667 went into the pool. 

i ended up getting $395 that day. 

my tips were double, triple, or quadruple any of the other servers that day. one server put $350 in the pool, the rest were all $200 or less. 

cue me asking the owner for clarification because i have no idea how this is possible. 

he starts freaking out at me. saying he put the support on pool for a few hours, and his assistant on pool for a few hours. we had a boh come in and help out with taking tables from 2-4pm, but they put him on pool for 1-5pm. as soon as it was 4pm he was off the floor, no help with end of shift duties or anything. 

the support staff and assistant rolled cutlery, helped with clearing tables (you have to tell them and direct them to which table) and seat guests with menus. they didn't even help me with clearing and resetting the second floor after the party. the first evening server came in and helped me with that. 

they literally did what they are paid and tipped out for. but for some reason they are being put on pool making the same as a server for a portion of their shift? 

fuck that. ",novacandy,tfys
76,my boss is unsympathetic and is driving me to quit,"(originally posted on a relationship subreddit but i thought i might try here for some insight from others in the service industry.) 

i(19f) have been working in a restaurant for three years now. i’m a hostess, but i do more than that. i clean tables, answer the phone, run food, refill drinks and help close at the end of the night. 

my mom(40f) and aunt (45f) started taking ownership of the restaurant about a year and a half ago. it’s been admittedly rough at times, as working with family usually is. they fight each other constantly and every week it’s something new. 

last night we closed at 10. a customer called in what i thought was a carry out order at 9:40. they come in and sit themselves at a dirty table and start eating. i personally think this is rude, but i cleaned the table for them and left them alone. 

i go to the back and start venting. i hate when customers do this because it’s a sneaky way for them to not tip while occupying space. 

my aunt gets mad. she gets in my face and yells at me about how they’re paying customers anyway and i need to go serve them. 

i tell her that it’s not right. they didn’t tip me to do that, they only pay for the food and that’s what they’re getting. i feel like it’s not fair what was done to me and it’s not fair she’s making me tend to them. 

she tells me to then “quit bitching about it”. and tells another server to get them water. 

i am so shaken at this moment for being screamed at and i start crying. i go to the kitchen to calm down and cry. 

later, her and her husband(40s?m) come up to me. the conversation goes something like this. (husband= h and aunt= a) 

h: you need to understand customer service. if you don’t tend to them they’ll tell other people that we don’t treat our customers well. 

me: i know customer service. i worked here for three years and know what i have to do but i feel like i shouldn’t in this moment and instead of listening to my points you guys just tell me i’m wrong! 

h: we aren’t saying what you’re feeling is wrong—

me: if it wasn’t then you guys wouldn’t be in my face right now! 

a: fine! then what’s your points? 

me: they sat themselves at a dirty table and didn’t tip me. i shouldn’t provide them a service they didn’t pay extra for. 

a: they are still paying customers! they pay your paycheck, they pay the cooks paycheck. you should just suck it up and deal with it because i’ve been stiffed before too! 

me: i’m not even a server! it’s not fair what they did. people do that all the time to get out of tipping—

h: how do you know that. 

a: yeah, what if they were going to leave you cash on the table? 

h: you need to remember that you’re going to get bad customers too—

me: i don’t care about them! my problem is with you guys. you guys aren’t listening to me. you’re steamrolling over me as an employee for the sake of good customer service! it has to get to the point where i at least feel like you’re on my side for once. 

a: you take things so personal—

me: this isn’t about me personally! this is about this isolated work incident that i think is fucked up.

anyway my aunt ends this conversation by telling me to go home, and that if i’m that bothered them i should just go home and “reflect”. 

this isn’t the first time my aunt went haywire. 

about a month ago, a customer came in asking for a take out menu. my aunt came up to the hostess stand with me and i said “oh i don’t know where they are, do you know?” 

and she blew up. she yelled at me about how i should know, since i’m the one that works up there and not her. she said i need to use my common sense and open my eyes before handing me a take out menu (it was covered by a rag).

that all happened in front of the customer. i was embarrassed and told my aunt later to not talk to me like that. 

all these events and my aunts generally nasty attitude has me planing on leaving this job. it isn’t just me she attacks, a server (non family) told me yesterday that he was ready to go home because of my aunt. 

the conflict within me however is that my mom also owns this business. my mom is pregnant with another 1 year old child at home and i told her i would do my best to help her with this business. 

i just don’t know how to get the courage to quit and talk to my mom. i wondered about doing an ultimatum where i either quit or get placed on separate days than my aunt. 

i want to tell my mom that if they had a non-family member put through what i have been, then they would get sued for abuse! 

you can’t run a business like that. if you’re a boss, you need to know how to talk with people. this isn’t about me. yes, i should have sucked it up and let them be there, but i also shouldn’t have been yelled at for feeling a certain way for the sake of “good reviews”. 

my mom and aunt have established in the past a disregard for reviews anyway? and my aunt had had numerous incidents of prejudice towards customers of a certain ethnicity. my aunt has refused to serve a table who disrespected her, so why can’t i refuse service? 

i don’t know how to talk to my mom. i only know i want to quit. i’m just stressed because i recently moved into my own apartment as well. 

my cousin (who heard everything) said we should have a meeting. i’m not sure. 

i’m willing to admit i was acting petty and stubborn, but it was blown way out of proportion because my aunt can’t talk to people without yelling or talking down on them. 

tldr: my mom and aunt own a restaurant. my aunt likes to talk down or yell at people. it makes me want to quit but i want to step up for my pregnant mother. ",xivanhnee,tfys
77,i jinxed myself.,"last week, one of the local high schools did a thing and there were 50 or so kids in the back room until midnight, a planned thing, so the servers who worked in that room that we usually close after 9, stayed and took care of it. it was a lot, and loud and the air was heavy with teenage sweat and angst and fried food. i thanked my lucky stars i was in the main dining room and don't have to deal with huge parties. for the record, they had 2 great servers, an added 17% autograt and the kitchen cranked shit out perfect. 


tonight was slow., as i'm finishing up my dining room, i usually stay late and move over to the bar side, trying to grab a quick smoke, i get told i have a table. i have 2 tables, and one is my husband! yay. and then i get seated again. and again. and dining room is filling up.. but then i notice my manager in the back room pulling tables together. 


my husband tells me, oh hey, i was talking to our neighbor, the school put on a play tonight, you're about to get busy. crap.  like 100 teenagers pile in. no joke. i am so lucky i am dealing with my few tables in the dining room still. i tell my tables i want to get their orders in quick before the party.. oh, wait. these are their parents. ok. 


so now there are literally 100 teenagers in the back, i have a few other tables just trying to live, and then parents, who keep joining my parent table. 2 servers are staying late to do the party, not my prob.. until it is. i got asked to pick up 2 booths. there are at least 6 kids at each booth meant to seat 4. chairs everywhere, people squashed in everywhere. 


ok, i can handle 2 more tables. holy crap, these kids are on some kinda theater high or maybe meth, idk. trying to take one order is 36 voices coming at me at once. ""i'll have a fr.. i love your earrings.. no sit next to me.. i'm with her.. my sister is somewhere over there and gluten free please put her on my check"" .. i had to just stop and look at them multiple times because i had told them this can only work one at a time. 


so i've got my manager on milkshake duty because everyone wants milkshakes, not just my tables, but everyone's. luckily teenagers want mostly burgers and chicken strips. my 2 tables are fine.


then this long table i have to pass by has been forgotten, and keeps asking to order. my tables' food is out, so ok. i'm already in this. i take half the table, then the other half. everything is fine, everyone is happy.


i have about 25-30 people. normally, i'd split it by person, but my new place doesn't have the option of entering by seats. when the first few people ask for their checks, i split theirs off and shit is fine. until i have my manager breathing down my back to split it up all at once, kids throwing cash at me and saying they don't need change, people paying for each other, my husband just chilling in the dining room watching the show, enjoying his burger, ha!


finally,  to get things straight, my manager had to add a few drinks and such to checks, when the drinks were on a different table and couldn't be combined. so i got bitched out for having people not pay when we literally added those new items to make up for the ""not paid"" ones, if that makes sense. and then i got called out for taking that big table, that nobody had even greeted, because nobody told me to take it. sorry for helping. if i didn't take it, they might still be there tomorrow night waiting.


oh, and i totally forgot about the parent table in the main dining room, although they tipped me well. the kids were all decent.


i guess the moral to my rant is.. never be too happy it isn't you, because next time, it might be you, and double worse! and i have cool earrings.

79,the best this week!!,"recently found this community and now i have a lovely addition: 
yesterday i served a table. i’ve been in the industry for a long while and this particular table really blew me away. reservation was a 6 top, 3 guests present as i approached the table and offered water. the host immediately asked for a bottle of opus one. fair enough, we usually carry that wine, though it is quite expensive. i also sold the last bottle 3 days before but i immediately agreed and told the guest i would bring the bottle ($650 pre tax cost, btw). my manager went to get the bottle and the guest was happy.... for a few minutes. 
    presented the bottle, opened and poured a taste. the guest asked me to “pour the whole fucking bottle” in his glass. the barolo glasses we stock don’t fit an entire bottle. so he let his friends have a few ounces and poured the rest in his wine glass. fast forward about an hour and he can’t finish the big boy glass of wine he poured, so he asks to have the wine to go. my back-waiter had thrown the bottle away, so i chose a different bottle to pour it back into. all should be good...
but then the guest ordered 9 shots of johnny blue for his table and his neighboring table.... for 675 bucks. sure no prob, i bring them to the table and get an order for a triple espresso, which i serve and then immediately serve another triple espresso to the same guy.
i ran to put the check down just in case his heart exploded and he couldn’t pay the bill.
and then, he tipped 30% in cash an that’s the end of the story ",baltimoreboy11,tfys
80,i just finished my last service.,"hey everyone. i have been a lurker and very occasional commenter here for the decade that i have been in the restaurant industry. next monday i begin a new career in sales at a pretty decent sized tech company. 

i am someone who has only worked professionally in the restaurant industry. i moved to city soon after college and was a delivery boy, dishwasher, food runner, bar back, bartender, server, assistant manager, and gm over the course of my career. i am changing industries because i got married and a daytime schedule is more conducive to our future plans. it's a good job and a good opportunity and i am excited about it. but i also feel like i've lost a part of myself and my identity and it makes me happy and sad at the same time.

the restaurant industry taught me how to be an adult. it taught me how to work. it taught me how to celebrate everyday excellence. it taught me to appreciate and understand the flaws that we all have. it taught me more lessons and skills than i will ever be able to list. it's so alien to me that i'm not a part of it anymore.

i have met so many people who are beyond amazing, including the person who got me this fancy new job. from dishashers to managers, from more countries than i can count. it has been my privilege to know and be with and fight for all of you.

i'm sorry i am having a hard time processing my emotions right now and i needed to tell someone. until recently i thought i was a lifer; quite a bit of my identity was the industry. at the same time there are many good things to come out of this move. stability, benefits, pto (!), the opportunity for advancement, home life, etc. if you weigh the pros and cons it's not a choice. but i've been a part of this fraternity for so long, it is hard to say that i no longer belong to it.

thank you for being your amazing selves.

81,entitled lady needs unattainable service,"so this is a combination of the stories from my coworker and i had today. any dialogue will be labeled as el for entitled lady and me as me.

&amp;#x200b;

so today i was called into the place early, as there were lines out the door and a packed dining room throughout most of the day. the whole staff was strained due to this, because it was an unusual rush, and we were being drained of food. during the rush, i get a phone call about a catering order and it goes something like this:

me: hi this is \*restaurant's name,\* this is op, how may i help you?

el: i'm calling about my catering order i placed earlier, does my order come with \*insert specific item here\* (omitting it because it's a restaurant signature and would give away the restaurant)

me: of course ma'am, all of our catering orders carry that item. the manager who placed the order with you should have gone over the specifics.

el: well she didn't. she left me on hold for 45 minutes! it's unacceptable!

me: i'm sorry to hear that! i can take down your name and number and pass along the message to the general manager when they get back.

el: that's unacceptable, and i don't trust someone as low level as you to tell them. you'll probably just blow me off! i want to speak to the manager now!

me: well the manager is currently out, i can pass you over to the team leader. please hold.

&amp;#x200b;

at this point i can hear her getting angry as i mute the microphone and go to the back. i hand my coworker the phone and tell her good luck. she takes one look at the id and looks flustered. she takes the call and tells me the story after.

&amp;#x200b;

this lady is a regular. her orders have always been right and she's known to throw a fit in before the orders come and then act pleasant when her caterings arrive. today she calls in the middle of the rush, so they took down her name and number and tell her they will call back when the rush ends, and they can properly give her a quote. i guess this was unacceptable, because 15 minutes later she came into the store in person, yelling about how they left her on hold. mind you, she wasn't. she has her dog who is not a service animal, barking and creating a scene. she is demanding to be served right away in that crowd, when they finally took her order. she finally left and had called the restaurant at least 4 more times throughout the day, using a harsh attitude and yelling at people about various parts of her order.

&amp;#x200b;

yes, we did and will continue to serve her after this.

82,every. single. table,"new to this subreddit, how y'all doin?! 

so i serve/manage a small family-run restaurant, and i have recently injured my knee. it may be my acl so i'm wearing a brace for stability while i wait for an mri. the brace doesn't fit very well under pants so i have been wearing shorts for my shifts which leaves the brace completely visible. 

i've stopped trying to count how many tables have asked me ""aww, what did you do to your knee?"" and it's driving me crazy at this point. i can usually brush it off with just ""oh may have torn my acl"", and turn around and leave the table because i'm always busy and i don't have time to sit there and talk with everyone about what i've done.

83,"dear customers, please, please give me a break","new to this subreddit, hi everyone! i’m a waitress at a small family owned diner in the middle of nowhere, and somehow i always have at least 3 tables a day that make me question whether i should abandon my job, family, and move to the other side of the country.

today, as in 20 minutes ago, cause i’m writing this immediately out of shock, i had a 4-top, young parents and their twin(?) toddlers. they seemed nice throughout their meal, a little harsh on the screaming kid, but not really too disruptive or demanding, anything like that.
but right before they paid their check, the mom went into the bathroom, and when she came out, she was screaming bloody murder, even though she was quiet the whole time she’d been in there, doing her business, etc etc

so, yelling right into my face, she says “someone shit on the floor, and it looks like it’s been there for days! this place is filthy, and” of course, what else, “we want a refund or i’ll report you to the health department!”

and i had to explain that i had cleaned the bathroom a few minutes before they’d arrived, and nobody else had been in there between mopping and the “poo discovery”, with 4 of my regular construction worker customers confirming this

i told her i’d be happy to give a refund to anyone in that situation, but straight up said that i wasn’t paying her for shitting on the bathroom floor

—-her husband apologized and they left, i went into the bathroom, and found a plastic dollar store type prank turd.

84,you should know your kid diet better than us.,"sorry if it’s long, english is not my language and i’m really bad at summaries.

this is one of the many interactions that reinforces my belief that if you want to have a child you should pass a test first. 

set up: middle of an incredibly busy service around 7pm in one of the busiest area in london, we are 3 members of staff down. the phone rings and luckily i am the one that picks up. 

this lady books a table for next week, i see from our system that we are nearly fully booked but i try and squeeze her party of 5 because our system recognises her name and apparently she’s been here few times. 

based on this i expect the lady to know what type of restaurant we are, but she proves me wrong, so here we go with the conversation that makes me dread the day she will come and dine. 

me is myself, sc is space cadet, the woman that has been in our restaurant many times and still has no clue what we do.

sc: my 2yrs (age is important here) old nephew is seriously allergic to gluten, dairy and eggs, what can he have from the kids menu?

me: madam we do not have kids menu but we will be happy to suggest some items from the sides sections, such as fries or some veggies

sc: he doesn’t eat that stuff, can you tell me about your roast? do you have kids roast menu?

me (while the restaurant is bursting with guests,  walk ins at the door, the other phone line ringing, food on the pass): madam we do not have kids menu, our roasts are “adult size” but if you’re happy to order it we can modify it without butter/gluten and eggs on the day of your reservation”  

sc: ok but can you not make a smaller portion for him? like a half chicken?

me: no madam, as i said we do not do half portion or kids portion, it’s a whole baby chicken, usually guests order it anyway and the parents/relatives eat half of it, or they order sides for the kids. why don’t you have a look on our website and see what he could have? we can modify pretty much everything as we cook fresh. 

sc: can’t you tell me now what he will be able to have? 

after listing all the items he could have, but making clear that we do not do half portions, she proceeds to tell me that her nephew doesn’t like most of those things.

at this point i was about to loose my patience, the rest of the staff was silently calling for my help for the actual service so i found a way to hang up after assuring her we’d our best. 

not even 5 minutes into the service that the phone rings again, deep down in that part of my brain that recognises trouble immediately, i knew it was related to the space cadet woman. 

i answer, it’s a man, phew, no more oblivious woman! but i was wrong, very wrong.. he was the brother of said lady, the father of this poor little fella that’s allergic to the best things in life! 

the father opens the conversation with: my sister just booked a table for next week and my 1yrs old son is allergic to dairy, eggs and nuts.

me: sorry sir but i thought your son was 2 and allergic to gluten eggs and dairy? no mention of nuts from your sister! 

tf: what? no! he’s only 1 and no no, he can have gluten but no eggs and no dairy and nuts so from your kids menu, what can he have? 

me( i don’t have kids, i have no idea what they eat that young but i highly doubt that the diet of a steak house is recommended for a one year old): well sir, we don’t have kids menu but he can order some stuff from the sides?

tf: he doesn’t eat potatoes or vegetables, do you not have some plain chicken? or what about your nut roast? 

me: nut roast.... has nuts in it, isn’t your son allergic to nuts? it also comes with a cheese sauce! 

tf: ah right, yes! he can’t have it then.. well do you sell steaks? 

at this point i started to think it was all a prank, what kind of person calls a steak house, tries to modify the menu on the phone for a baby that could easily eat some baby stuff that you buy in shops and then drops this stupid question?

me (with a very exasperated voice) : we have steaks, we have lots of steaks, if at 1 year he eats steak then you can order it on the day of your reservation. 

tf: wow cool! he loves steaks, we will see you next week then! 

both conversations left me speechless for a couple of minutes, all the staff that was listening had a wtf face at the end. now i’m left with so many questions.

do babies eat steaks? do the parents/relatives know the difference between the allergens? is this baby going to live long enough to learn them by himself? 

and considering that was the easiest interaction of the evening i went home asking myself: did some kind of black hole full of stupidity opened up in our walk in fridge and now every single table is paying the consequences? ",EatPastaRunFasta87,tfys

87,how dare you show up early 😡,"this just happened today.  had a catering order on the other side of town.  the customer requested delivery by 11:15am.

not sure of how much traffic i might hit, i gave myself an hour to get there.  luckily traffic wasn’t bad so parked in temp parking and headed up with the food.

i walked into the office and announced myself to the receptionist.  her abrupt response:

“you’re early.”  

i checked my clock,  it was 10:50.  

“yeah” i said  “about 20 minutes.  wasn’t sure how traffic would pan out.”

“more like 45 minutes...” she says tersely.  i check the paperwork in my hand.  it still says 11:15 delivery. im a little confused now.  

i ask her where she wants the food set up, she points me to the conference room.

i set up the salads, sandwich trays, condiments &amp; utensils.  i asked the receptionist if i could walk her through the setup so she would know where everything was.  she declined, which i thought was weird.  i always walk the client though the set up.  it was 11 sharp when i left.

when i get back to the restaurant i read an email from the receptionist complaining that i was:  too early, a sandwich was missing,  that the sandwiches could “potentially” be soggy and she was demanding a 50% discount.

the enraging part was, if she had allowed me to walk her through the setup like i asked she would have learned:

a. where the missing sandwich was ( on one of the trays)
b.  all the sandwiches are served dry with spreads on the side specifically so they wouldn’t get soggy

i have done hundreds of caters and this is the first time i had someone get angry that i arrived early, refuse to allow me to explain the order to them and then complain about what my food could “potentially” taste like.  who does that?!?

i apologize and dad says all good how was i to know! grab drink orders- son asks for a glass of atomic waste.. lol which i give him a joke whatever. they also have a daughter who is probably 9/10/11 with very short hair who is extremely polite. every server who went over she was like ""wow you are pretty, everything is great, thanks for checking on us,"" etc etc, while the rest of the family just stared. 

so one of our servers brings out their soups and she was closest to the husband so put his down first (shouldn't have i know, but she's new and.. a tad slow lol so whatever we do it all the time) husband freaks out and is like its ladies first how would you feel if your bf was served first.

95,‘dine and dash’ customer vrs chain restaurant policy. server wins!,"so, harking back to my restaurant days...
worked in an upscale holiday park, with only one till that is used by the manager. all servers provide there own float and take responsibility for all there tables bills i.e if someone goes without paying, the server is liable for there bill. 
at the end of the shift the manager tells you what you owe the company in cash and card payments, you must pay the full amount regardless of what has happened during shift.

always thought this policy was unfair. especially as on the few occasions the fire alarm went off and the restaurant was cleared those who had finished eating rarely returned to settle the bill.

on this specific occasion i was working in the kids section (it had a soft play area in the corner) and a table of 2 arrived just before closing. the were seated the other end of the restaurant and i was told to serve them as well as my section. i complained i was too far from them to give the service they required but was told to get on with it.
anyway, everything’s running smooth despite me not being able to glance over and check on them as often as i’d like. gets to the end of the meal and they ask for the bill.
i bring it over and they say they have vouchers. i tell them i’ll be back in one moment to settle the  bill with them after dropping the bill at another table (giving them a minute or two in order to get the voucher and payment ready) and to make sure the vouchers are valid for our restaurant. 

i drop the bill on the kids section table and head back to find them missing and a £50 ‘love to shop’ voucher on the bill tray.
a voucher that isn’t accepted in my store. 
the bill is about £45 so i go speak to the manager.
he informs me i’m liable for the payment in full. i argue i was unable to do my job effectively while stretched across the length of the restaurant but the manager doesn’t care.

i’m annoyed, but accept it, begrudgingly. 
at the end of the shift when we are cashing off he manager asks me to pay the £45 on my debit card and return the voucher to him. 
now i’m furious.
firstly, i’m staff. so i expect 50% off the bill making it £22.50 not £45, and more importantly, why does the business, which does not accept these vouchers, taking the voucher from me?! 
i argued angrily for about 30 minutes until the bill was reduced for a staff member and it was agreed that i could keep the £50 voucher against the £22.50 i paid for there meal.

sure the manager wanted to pocket the voucher himself, and that the customer was aware the voucher wasn’t acceptable after i motioned for them to check if it was but they were unlikely to know i would be responsible for there bill.

long story short;
customer tried to pay bill with invalid voucher, manager expected me to pay full price for there meal and keep the voucher for himself.

103,faith in humanity was restored,"tonight i had a family of 8 come in and they ordered a ton of food—their bill came out to be about $450 with gratuity. i work at a hibachi/teppan restaurant so 10 people sit at one table even if they are separate parties, so across from this family sat a young couple who also ordered about $100 worth of food. well it turns out that the lady is getting deployed on sunday to iraq for 9 months. she was super emotional about it, saying that this might be her last meal at our restaurant, etc. when it came for the table to pay their tabs, the dad of the family stops them and tells me that their dinner is on him, saying that it’s the least he can do to thank her for her service. i was so surprised considering that they were complete strangers before they got sat at the same table, and the family of 8 didn’t look too well off either. anyways it was just an emotional moment for all of us. even the busser and i were close to tears lol. there are decent people out there guys!!",ilikenovembers,tfys
104,passive aggressive serving,"so i’ve been doing this job for 20 years. i’ll be 40 in july. 

back in my 20’s, i would fly off the handle at the drop of a hat. never directly to my tables — but the amount of f-bombs and curses i called down on my customers was biblical in proportion.

i went into another job field for about seven years, then came back. now that i’m older and wiser, i can see right through people. i’ve done this job long enough that i can tell what kind of person you are, and how the experience is going to go, within the first thirty seconds of talking to you. 

(now, mind you, i had this skill even back in my 20s. but back then it infuriated me because i hoped against hope that maybe this time the table would be different. it never, ever was, which was why i would get so angry.)

now i just don’t give a shit. i mean, i do, i’m a professional, it’s my job. but i can see through all the bullshit and at this point, i honestly don’t care. i want to give you an awesome experience, but some people come in with the specific goal of being pissed off, remaining pissed off, and spreading that pissed offness to as many people as possible. i cannot help those people.

but if a table is being assholes and they’re running me and asking for stupid little stuff, i bring it out in embarrassingly inordinate amounts. setting down a salad bowl full of ranch for one couple may seem excessive but it gets the point across and i don’t have to bring them 18 ramikens of ranch like they want me to. same with drinks. if the kids are sucking them down, or the adults, you’re getting less and less ice. i don’t give a shit if your kid drinks nine dr peppers. it’s 9:50 pm and you’re gonna have to deal with the sugarsmacked maniac later, not me.

even if i get stiffed, i don’t punch the wall anymore or scream in the freezer. i just shrug, say fuck them, and forget them — because i’ll most likely never ever see them again, ever. so why should i let one table of schmucks ruin my night? i get way more good tips than bad tips, so, eh.

getting older really does help.

111,ambulance called for paralytic woman who “only had 2 cocktails”,"short but sweet

i work in a pretty nice italian restaurant in a large city in the uk. we’re located on a street with lots of bars and clubs so naturally we have a lot of people come to eat before they hit the town, especially at the weekend (we also have people that just get drinks at our bar) and this story happened on a busy saturday evening a few weeks ago. 

there is a door to the hallway where our disabled bathroom is which is always open and one of our buss stands is just before this door. i’m printing off a bill and i see this lady rolling around on the floor. i peek my head around and i see there are actually 3 of them; one rolling around on the floor laughing, one stood up laughing as well and one completely blacked out on the floor. they were all probably in their late 40s. i ask them if the third lady is okay and they’re all clearly drunk and laugh and say she’s fine. 

this doesn’t fly with me and i grab the manager who straight away calls 999. i went back to work at this point (it was a saturday at around 9pm so we were still super busy). the woman ended up getting carted out by the paramedics and put in an ambulance. 

the rest i only heard from my coworkers, but apparently the other women were insisting she was okay and that she only had one or two cocktails all night. shortly after they said this, an empty 750ml bottle of gordons gin falls out the blacked out womans bag. they apparently shut up after this. 

i have no idea what happened to that woman but she is forever a legend amongst my coworkers. i assume she woke up the following morning in a&amp;e feeling pretty sorry for herself lol. also they never paid their bill but i guess my manager wasn’t too keen on placing the bill in the hands of two hysterical drunk women and their blacked out friend xx",myheartraterapid,tfys

a table of 3 was dining the ayce menu and at the end of their meal they still had a significant amount of food left on their table. they told me they seriously cannot eat anymore. the lady told me to give it to another customer. bare in mind that some of the food has been touched before, for example a dish may include 5 pieces of meat and they had already eaten one piece from it. 

i told them no we cannot serve leftovers to other customers. why not? they ask. at this point i just had a million question marks in my head. what kind of person lacks the common sense that leftover food would never ever be passed forwards to another paying customer?! 

i then explained to them that we have a waste policy (which they were aware of) and that i can either charge them for the leftovers and they can take it home, or they can stay longer and slowly eat it, no pressure. they decided to pay and get it boxed up. so i did. when they got round to paying for their bill, the lady was very angry and was in an argument with the other boys. not angry at me though, she was angry at the boys for over ordering. the whole situation really baffled me.

116,karen became unreasonably upset when i tried to explain a mistake,"hello everyone, i currently work in a cafe so i'm not sure of that's the same as a server but i wanted to share this anyway.

as i'm sure many of you servers know, occasionally orders go missing, whether its the printer deciding it doesn't want to work or someone misplacing a docket, it happens. usually when it's brought to our attention we attempt to fix it as soon as we can and customers are pretty understanding; not today.

i was running orders for our barista to tables and on the way back i get stopped by this karen.
her; hi i ordered quite a while ago and haven't revieved my order
me: oh i'm sorry, what was the order/table number i'll go check for you.

i go back to the barista, ask him if he has an order for her table and when he says he doesn't i let him know what happened and relayed the order, i just needed to ask her what size and if she's prefer it in a take away cup because of the wait.
while i'm there i check through the spiked dockets to see if we accidentally missed it, it was nowhere.

anyway i run one order out and go to approach her table, as soon as she sees me to gets up and starts walking to the counter, i attempt to get her attention and she just says, ""this is ridiculous""
me: ma'am we just had an issue with your docket, our barista is making it for you now, i just need to know what size?
her: it doesn't matter i just want my money back now, those people were here after me and they've been served
me: i'm really sorry for that but there must've been a mix up somewhere with our machine or misplacing a docket
her: i don't care its not my fault that you made a mistake, just give me my money!

she's practically yelling at me now as i walk behind the counter to the register
me; of course what size was it so i can process the refund?
her, holding her hand out: oh i don't know who cares it was $4
me: no problem

at this point my manger asks what's wrong and i explain the situation
manager: i'll process it for you, what number was the table? (she asked this to check later if it was a machine error or a human error)
her, yelling and visibly upset:7, this is appalling service i can't believe this honestly
manager: i'm very sorry here's your money back
her: absolutely appalling i waiting 30 minutes and that was the first sorry i got (a total lie) it was awful and i'll be telling everyone not to come here! 

she stormed off with her $4. my manager wasn't upset she understands that mistakes happen. the thing is, the only order in the system for her table was over an hour and a half ago, before i even started my shift. again it could just be a mistake but the whole situation was really odd.",Rapturesraptor,tfys
117,bitchy mom complains while my manager and i clean up vomit.,"i served for about 6 years and i was reminded of this story when it popped up on my time hop for today! 

it was a pretty slow afternoon and i was sectioned on the inside patio alone. the first table that came in was a family of 4, a mom, a dad, and two young children. i greeted them and laughed along with them as they were looking through the beer lists, as “it had been a long week”.  only the mom orders a beer - a 22oz shocktop. i bring it out and they order their meals. once their food is up i bring it out. 

the mom is immediately disgusted as her grilled chicken “is not seared enough”, so i offer to throw it back on the grill for her. in the time i took to walk her plate back to the kitchen, her youngest kid took one bite of his food, stood up, and promptly vomited all over the floor. where all that vomit came from, i don’t know.  i immediately grab my manager. it was about 4:30pm at this point, and our bussers come in at 5pm.  so my manager is gathering up cleaning supplies from the back, and at this point, other servers were casually started to stare and see what was going on.  the dad had now taken the puke kid and other kid out to the car and we boxed up their food (which i was still waiting on mom’s seared chicken). 

my manager comes back with cleaning supplies and the mom makes a scene about how people are staring and that the vomit isn’t being cleaned fast enough and we were “embarrassing her”. my manager and i scrubbed the vomit-floor while the mom sat there casually sipping on her (second) 22oz shocktop .  

my manager then took over the cleaning, while i grabbed the family’s check. she then complained that we charged for extra ranch and other dipping sauces.  needless to say, she didn’t tip. she also called the owner... weird, because he was sitting at the bar drinking and never once picked up a phone call.

118,but you said you didn’t want them?,"tldr at bottom
i bartend at my local bar and grill and have quite a few regulars that i enjoy, some that are alright and one or two that i don’t mind seeing when they’re around. 

so last night i have a regular, one who doesn’t fall into any of those categories. he’s just there. doesn’t talk much, tips decent to average (which honestly doesn’t bother me because i make minimum plus tips.) 

i am slammed last night; full bar, 30+ people and taking a table or two, and seating people because we’re short a server and host. bar guest orders boneless wings sauce on the side. a server runs the food and the sauce, of course, is on the wings. the server makes a comment that they’re bringing correct ones but since we’re busy to just enjoy them for now; and he does. 

fast forward about 15 min and he has about 2 of 10 left, i ask if he wants the other wings or not since it’s taking awhile. he says “no.” 

i mentioned to my manager he no longer wanted them but they were already being made. fast forward 5 min and he brings them out. instead of dropping them off to him, we dropped  them off to a group of regulars who are always there, fun and easy going people because why not; plus we were just going to throw them anyway. he sees this and flips out. 

reg: “wait are those my wings? you gave away my wings. that’s not fair!” 

me: (surprised) “but you said you didn’t want them? they were already being made so we decided to treat other guests. i’m sorry. we’re super busy; it’s a disaster down here and up here and i didn’t realize this would be an issue.” 

reg: “well?!” 

me: (hands flailing) “well?!!” 

i proceed to tell my boss and he begrudgingly takes them off. i’m so mad i don’t want to talk to him and of course as i’m passing he makes a comment on how busy we are and i fill him in on all the other things i’m doing aside from bartending. i drop off his check at the end of the meal, with his wings clearly missing because he only paid for two drinks. he didn’t say a word, didn’t even bring up the fact that we took it off his bill. he left $3 on what should have been a $30 tab. the tip doesn’t bother me. what does is that he didn’t even bother to say thanks after all of that, which i feel is the least he could have done. 

tldr; regular asked for boneless wings sauce on the side, they came out wrong we’re  in the process of making him new ones, said he didn’t want them, ate the wrongly made order and was mad that we gave away “his” wings when they were delivered to another group of regulars.

119,"""they always let me use it here!""","ltl;ftp

hey y'all!

background: so i work at your typical bovine wacky wings and we're all trained to check for valid ids for the purchase of alcohol. we have the right to refuse an id for obvious reasons; underage patrons, scratches, missing chunks, expiration etc etc. the most common issue we have when refusing ids is people bringing in very old identification and getting upset when it won't be accepted. our managers are great about this, they will almost always back you up in refusing to accept id but will sometimes make exceptions if the customer is nice enough.

so on to the main story. i had just sat a 6-top and was grabbing drink orders for them when one guy in the group asked for a tall beer. i id'd him and he produces a passport for me to view. this passport has expired. 6 years ago. so this is our exchange:

m: me

c: customer

b: bossman

m: ""i'm sorry do you have a non expired form of id?""

c: ""no, that's all i got.""

m: ""unfortunately, i can't accept this as it's no longer valid. can i get you anything else to drink? soda or water?""

c: ""no, i want a beer, just use that id.""

m: ""i'm really sorry, sir, but i cant.""

c: ""what's the problem? it's got my face and age on it, they always let me use it here!""

m: ""would you like me to get the manager? he may be able to bend the rules for you but i don't have the authority to do that.""

c: ""yeah, go get him.""

so i go to the back and find the bossman and give him a rundown of the situation. he says he'll go over and talk to the table. so, me being nosy, i hid in the corner near the table so i could watch everything. (you never know who's gonna kick up a fuss but i love the drama so i was waiting just in case.) the man talks to my manager for a few minutes before the whole table got up and left.

bossman come over to me laughing:

b: ""you should've told me it was over 6 years expired! i was gonna make an exception if it was only off by a year or less but that's ridiculous! who can't get a new passport after 6 years?""

very anticlimactic ending but team bossman for sticking with me.

then we find out a week before the event that it’s not for you. it’s for your 12 year olds birthday and there will be 50+ kids in attendance. with all the grace of a wet paper napkin hitting a blender on full speed you asked us, *is that a problem?*

on the day, you showed up half an hour early and ordered drinks while i was still setting up the bar. i’d prepped some beers in a nice little ice bucket arrangement, but you and the  three karens of the apocalypse wanted cocktails at your 12 year olds goddamn birthday party.

so i come back into the kitchen and call over the line (protocol and standard procedure) for a few refills from our dessert guy and i was met with petulant rage and ended up getting cursed out over a few slices of banana and some marshmallows, i was stunned because i was quite literally doing nothing different than i normally would and just trying to do my job to the best of my abilities even though i too am stressed. so instead of getting into it with the line guy, i step away and approach my manager and ask her how i’m supposed to respond to being told to basically fuck off for no god damned reason, which he over hears and starts laying into me screaming at me for once again, no prompted reason. naturally at this point i begin losing my cool, i’m a pretty even keeled person and as a server i have one of the best poker faces but when faced with a disrespectful coworker my rage becomes real so we are in full screaming mode, this my friend is the moment it happened, *this mother fucker grabs a handful of shredded carrots from the expo line and chucks them directly at the back of my head and neck* and i swear in that moment everything went silent and red. 

my face went from confused to angry and my manager quite literally had to stop me from backing him into a corner and laying him out. she sent me to the office to simmer down and threatened his job. we all work in the same place so i understand and recognize that we are all stressed and going through it, i’m not being insensitive to that, not all of us can control our tone, *however* if you’re unable to control your words and more importantly yourself when you’re stressed then maybe you need to find another job where you won’t have to explore that character flaw so often.

now my wife and i do not go out to eat much.  we go to breakfast at a southern chain on the weekends and occasionally to dinner.

i started about 10 years ago always giving a 100% tip when we do go out.  this isn't a lot of money to me and i just feel like as many crappy people as a server has to deal with every day it might be nice for them to have someone ""settle up"" for them so to speak.

now when we go to a random restaurant for dinner, it isn't a big deal.  we usually tip on the cc or if i happen to have cash i'll slide it under a drink and we get out dodge as there really isn't a need for an awkward thank you.

the problem we are starting to see is with the routine visits to the same breakfast spot.  i guess word has gotten around to all of the servers and now there is a lot of ""jockeying"" when we come in to get us to sit in their sections.  this makes us very uncomfortable.

we just want to enjoy our breakfast and do our little part to help out people in an industry that i think gets the shit-covered end of the stick when it comes to respect and compensation.

my boss is a bit of a cheapskate and we have our fair share of easily fixable problems that just haven't been dealt with because mr. boss man thinks $300 is too much to fix the 3 broken sinks we have in the kitchen. we also use these plastic cups with numbers on them for in house orders, and little cards with numbers for to-go ones. (this is important later!!)
we have a lot of regulars and even though i've been working there for only a few months i know a lot of our customers really well and consider them good people. 
we also get a lot of people coming in expecting the old menu and getting irritated or disappointed that we've changed our menu. this happened before i started working here, but we basically used to serve sushi and chow mein but don't anymore because we don't have cooks trained to do those things.

so the family that comes in is one of the ones that hasn't been since the menu change and voices their irritation. 
i apologise and explain that the change happened before my employment and explain the gist of why things were different.

""we came here because the noodles were so good and you gave a lot of food and free sides""

i'm immediately on guard. free sides? in this establishment? internally i'm wheezing with laughter.
i, once again, apologise. a little less sincere now that this person has, for some reason, lied to me.

""oooh! money!!""

the plastic tip jar is yoinked off the metal counter and plastic order numbers fly from their basket. the only thing stopping a successful theft is a shitty little cord which i hated until this exact moment.  i stare in shock at the customer's son who just tried to take what little extra money my under minimum wage self earns. 

what? the heck? did that really just happen?????

the parents immediately turn to their son and scold him for trying to take something that isn't his. i'm more surprised that anyone would try and steal two singles and a dime than anything, even if it is just a kid.

things calm down for a moment, the parents order and i give their number to the boy, attempting to placate him a bit.
he immediately loses all interest in the blue plastic cup once he learns it is not for soda and instead turns his gaze on the cups he knows for a fact... are for sweet sickly carbonated nectar.
he grabs a medium cup, reaching around his mom and up past the register.
i try to stop him vocally by saying 
""i'm sorry but i think you should ask your parents if you can get one of those""
but he's already grabbed it
the parents groan and scold him again saying now they have to buy it but i offer to either charge them for a small or just toss out the cup and let them be.

""no he already touched it just charge me""

hm. okay. i will.
so i charge the dad for one of our $2 drinks even though our smalls are like. $1.25

so i think this is the worst of it. they'll be fine once they get their $40 worth of food. they'll leave a message table and no tip but this is the worst it will get.
boy howdy do i love being proven wrong!

order number 3 is ready so i grab as many plates as i can and go
i see only the little boy seated at the table and do everything i can not to roll my eyes.

""hey i have some plates for you and your folks! i have this right here...""

i slide a chicken bowl past him. no response. i put down a beef steak plate with no cabbage and extra macaroni. still nothing. i slide a portuguese sausage plate with eggs over easy right to this kid. 
he sneers at me as if i farted right on his food.

so i think. what the hell. i've been holding in a real fart the whole shift. screw you kid.
and i attempt to crop-dust this kid while turning to go grab more plates of food for him and his folks.
but it is not silent. and i feel a trickle of shame creep up my neck
but. within the exact moment i turn my back. 
this little evil child from hell yells

and throws an entire plate of food at me.
the sound of thick porcelain dropping onto the floor with a horrible crack covers the sound of my own crime.
but the entire restaurant goes silent.
except for this kid.
he's going batshit, screaming at me for not bringing his food
i have been flipped off. cursed at. called all sorts of names. i have been spat on.
but nothing shook me quite the way the sensation of freshly cooked eggs and sausage scalding my lower back did.
i turned and looked at this kid. not knowing what to do. how do i react? what do i say? 
before i can do anything my boss rushes out from the back of the kitchen to see which one of his fool employees broke a plate. 
he looks at me. looks at this kid screaming his head off at me sitting alone at a table.
the kids parents finally appear, i have no idea where they were. i don't care to be honest.
i look at my boss and i just start picking up the shattered plate and ruined food.
my boss comes over and asks me what happened and then sees my shirt.
there's really no way that i could've gotten egg on the back of my shirt and hair on my own accord so he puts two and two together
(my stunned silence is also probably a huge indicator)

and my boss looks this family in the face and tells them to leave.
and i damn near thought my knees would give out.
the last thing i expected was for my penny pinching boss to tell paying customers to get out but. here we were. 
he told me to continue cleaning, so i did, happy to get the hell out of metaphorical dodge.
but i overheard most of what was said
my boss gave an ultimatum. either leave or pay for the broken plate and my employees ruined clothes.
the family left, not without yelling up a storm about the food they paid for or defending their kid. but they left. and my boss got me another shirt and apologized for what happened

and the rest of the night went by pretty fast after that.

131,"""i'm allergic to all vegetables. all vegetables!""","i was reminded of this story today by a co-worker. 

we used to have a spinach dip on our menu that came with carrots, celery, and cucumbers. people could switch out the vegetables for corn tortilla chips if they wanted to. 

this woman is sitting with a man and orders the dip, but tells me she needs the vegetables to be on a separate plate entirely away from the dip because she is allergic to all vegetables. this sounds ridiculous at first, but one of my friends has this thing called oral allergy syndrome where she can't eat a lot of raw fruits and vegetables because it makes her mouth itch. i figure it's something like that.

&amp;#x200b;

so just to be clear, i ask, ""is it all raw vegetables, or are cooked ones okay?""

lady: ""not that it's any of your business, but as i said, i'm allergic to all vegetables! all vegetables."" 

me: ""i'm sorry to seem intrusive, but i only ask because there is cooked spinach and tomato in the spinach dip.""

lady: ""i know what i can and can't eat! just bring me the dip with the vegetables on the side! can you do that or not?""

me: ""of course. i'll be right back.""

&amp;#x200b;

i tell my manager about this, because i want to let him know that i am trying not to kill or injure this woman via allergies, and she told me that the dip was fine. he says to wait a minute before i put the order in so he can offer her the chip replacement option (which i should have done, but she basically dismissed me). even though they have corn in them, maybe she'll want those instead of the vegetables. maybe she doesn't like vegetables and said she was allergic, maybe she really is allergic to just raw vegetables and is confused about what i was asking. who knows. 

about two minutes later, i hear ""all vegetables!"" being yelled at my manager from the table. he comes over and tells me, defeated, to just put the order in and make a note to the chefs about putting the vegetables on a totally separate plate. 

&amp;#x200b;

i go to check on them after the food is delivered. i had brought them separate appetizer plates so the woman could get her own helping of the dip and avoid cross contamination. the man is eating the dip out of the shared bowl with the veggies, and the woman is dipping a spoon into the dip and just eating it like that. just sucking on a spoon and putting it right back into the communal, contaminated dip. neither of them are using their appetizer plates.

&amp;#x200b;

they said everything was great. i stopped questioning it and just let them get on with it. 

but really, i'll probably never stop questioning it.  i still think about it briefly every time i see spinach dip. ",athenahyena22,tfys

135,“what are you doing to my wife?”,"this happened last thanksgiving and i was not the table’s server, but hilarious all the same.

some background: we’re a small restaurant that  does a special event every thanksgiving, people book and pay in advance, and **every dime that isn’t tax or tip, goes to charity.** this means customers are normally in very high spirits - enjoying a good meal for a good cause.

at our first seating of the day (we do several seatings for big events), a couple comes in, they seem pretty normal. the first course comes out and the gentlemen claims that his wife’s meal is cold. now i’m not saying we’re above mistakes, but these course dinners are very hard to get cold, because as soon as they’re done they go *immediately* out.

our manager comes by and apologizes. after loudly going back and forth for a bit, my manager offers to comp the meal. **side note**: if you expect your meal for free at a charity event, you’re a douchebag.

as he picks up the wife’s meal, her butter knife slides off of the plate and hits the table. this is obviously my manager’s fault, but no customer has ever been egregiously offended.

at this point the husband stands up with so much force that his chair slides a foot behind him. he gets into my manager’s face and says “what are you doing to my *wife*? you hurt her!”

we’re a small place, so everyone is silent and staring. 

my manager waits a moment and (in response to being shouted at) says “sir, i’m sorry, i didn’t mean to drop the knife, but i’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

at this point, the asshole is completely taken aback. apparently no one has ever asked him to leave a restaurant before.

my manager walks away, and this douchebag takes his plate and scrapes all of his food onto the floor. then takes he and his wife’s glasses of wine, and dumps them on the table.

at this point the wife is horrified, quickly grabs her things and shuffles out. he leaves and all the other tables were completely tickled by the scene. it put everyone in a surprisingly good mood to banter about for the rest of the evening.

a little extra justice: they booked through open table and afterwards we charged them a $5 cleaning fee. it’s the little wins.

136,i’m pretty sure someone cursed our restaurant,"so monday was crazy. anything that could have gone wrong, went wrong and fast. on mobile so apologies for any formatting issues. 

it all started when the closing manager had his car break down. he was supposed to be there at two and wouldn’t be able to make it till 8. this left only a manager in training my himself, and we called in a a shift leader just in case. monday’s are slow so we’re normally pretty short staffed (about 7-8 servers and two grill cooks). 

we get slammed out of nowhere. the line is backed up our the door, we’re beginning to run 20 minute checks because of the overwhelming crowd. then it starts storming...bad. rain is coming down sideways, thunder and lighting every few seconds. and then the power goes out. 

it was only out for about 30 seconds max, but it set off a chain of events. for starters it took down our ventilation system. we have a huge wood fireplace in our restaurant that some karen insisted on being lit despite it being 68 outside. the fans and vents both fail. the room fills with smoke fast. guests are wetting napkins over their mouths to try and fight it. our eyes are running, we’re choking , even visibility is getting hard. 

the mit panicked and opens the emergency door to try and get the smoke out. which he entered the code to before...but because of the power failure the alarm system went off for two hours straight. at this point guests are beginning to leave and honestly who could blame them? the soda and coffee machine short circuit. nobody knows how to fix it. 

then the grand finale happens: our entire grill system goes down. no matter who we call or what we try, it refuses to come back on. this all happened in under 30 minutes. we went from a full house to 5 tables left in the entire building who had decided to try and tough it out. 

we didn’t get the grill running for at least an hour but at that point our clientele were gone. we all left about an hour and a half before closing. on the bright side, all my tables felt so bad for me i ended up walking with 35% of my sales. 

not sure if someone put a hex on our restaurant or we’ve racked up some serious karma through laughing at guests on the server alley.

137,the time i denied a discount,"some 15-17ish years back, i worked at a chain place.  table is about finished and the woman (i think with two teenage kids if i recall) said she's a manager at another store 2 hours away and thus she gets a discount.  news to me.  i ask management who is busy and he says she needs proof, pay stub, letter from the gm...something.  back to the table, and she says she doesn't have anything.  back to management, and again he says he needs something.  he says to have her call the gm, and she can pass him (my manager) her phone.  back to the table, i explain this, and she says she doesn't have a cell phone.  being nice, i said she could use mine.  i hand over my flip phone, she opens it and she sees my background image, a swimsuit model in a really tiny bikini.  she sort of rolled her eyes back up at me and said, ""real mature"" and then looked back at the phone to start dialing.  i was caught off guard for a second.  i think she was just about done dialing when i grabbed the phone out of her hands and said, ""looks like you're not getting your discount if you don't have a cell phone...i'll take your check when you're ready.""  i walked off and from where i walked over too, i saw her walking out 30 seconds later.  bill was like $38 and she left $40 total in cash.

this is one of my biggest pet peeves when bartending and i always ask the guest to please turn their device down and to think of other patrons around them but i should have to. it should be common knowledge that what you’re doing is fucking rude.

139,thinking of leaving full time job to serve... yes? no?,"so i am currently a driver working for fedex. its a stable consistent job, decent money and not usually too late of hours. similar to a service job in that i never know when i will be finished and hours can change drastically. i do enjoy working alone all day which is very different from serving and chatting all day.

however i have bad knees and jumping in and out of the truck is getting hard on them so i am looking for something new, if not full time at least to start on the weekends for extra cash.

my girlfriend serves at a restaurant and makes very good tips. it is a nicer chain restaurant, not anything you would need to dress up for but nicer than say montanas and about on par with a milestones. 

i am wondering if it would be worth it for me to begin serving either on the side or full time. i have spent about 4 years working in restaurants in my youth from about 2009-2013 working in the kitchen but i am not interested in going back into the kitchen.

i know as a good looking girl my girlfriend will make more tips than me as a goodish looking guy but she can make almost 200 in just tips on a busy night. because of this it seems like it could be an undervalued option for me to go into. i am making about 150 a day after tax give or take now so i am thinking between tips and the pay that matching that should be doable.

 do you guys think it would be a good plan for me to try and get into a nicer type restaurant as a server? i am thinking starting evenings and weekends if possible and then make a decision about whether to keep my full time job or move full time into serving.

any specific restaurants or types of restaurant to try to get into in southern ontario? or to avoid?
things to look for? 
anything else you can think of that i may not be considering?

another extra benefit to serving would be good experience for my resume if i ever decide to move out west to a resort restaurant or something like that. i was out in alberta at an a resort and my roommate (an english guy) made 150-250 a night in tips thanks to tourists and his accent. made me very jealous.

141,"entitled woman demands my absolute attention during coffee rush, leaves without paying","sorry for the formatting, i’m on mobile :0 also, first reddit post! 

so for context, i used to be a drive-thru barista when i was in high school, working my shifts alone. it wasn’t a bikini stand or anything, just a regular coffee stand. i dealt with the usual bitchy moms with 7 screaming kids in the car, girls who only get drinks to post on snapchat (i was amazed that this stereotype actually exists), etc no problem. but there’s one customer who takes the cake for the absolute worst, and i’m still petty about it 

she pulls up in this car with a bedazzled camouflage license plate. she’s probably like 30, 35. there’s her kid in the back seat. after a few minutes of asking me to explain “what’s in this?” “what’s in this?” on the menu, she finally settles on one of our blended drinks. she also demands that i show her each of our cups, because apparently it’s too much effort for her to visualize what 12, 16, 24 etc ounces looks like. at this point, there’s a couple cars waiting at the other window, but i can’t even ask for their orders because this woman keeps asking questions about the goddamn cups. she had a very uppity way of talking too; it was clear from her tone that she viewed me as below her. anyway, once i finally started making her drink, here’s how the interaction went from there:

*as i’m putting the ingredients in the blender* 

her: whats that? what are you putting in there? why so much ice? oh, by the way, i want caramel in it.

me: *answers her questions as i go* okay, i’ll add caramel! 

her: also, my son wants an italian soda. what flavors do you have? show me the cup sizes again for his drink. 

me, trying desperately to stay peppy and polite as there’s like 4 cars waiting now: for sure! here’s the flavor list. and i finished your drink, here ya go. 

her: ...where’s the caramel? 

me: haha, what do you mean? i added it in for you. 

her: i wanted a caramel /swirl/ on the sides of the cup. ugh, make it again. i can’t drink this. 

me, suppressing anger and stress: alright. let me know when you see a flavor you like for the italian soda. 

i’ll spare you guys the rest of the conversation, because it was basically just her asking a bunch of questions again and nitpicking what i was doing (“that’s too much syrup! it’ll be too strong for my son!” “i want more caramel!” etc). 

but unfortunately, the ending to this story is the worst part. after i finally finished her two drinks and was handing them to her, at this point with like 6 cars waiting, i told her the total after tax. she said, “oh that’s too expensive. fix your prices and then maybe i’ll come back again.” she didn’t take the drinks and sped off before i could say anything. i was p i s s e d. and of course, because the other cars had been waiting so long, none of them tipped. if she hadn’t been asking me unnecessary questions and demanding that i show her things then i could’ve handled the rush smoothly. i’m definitely not quick to anger, i’ve probably been truly angry only like twice in my life, but that woman got my blood boiling. but i hope it’s an entertaining story at the very least!

142,"sorry, she’s on meth!","i’m the manager of a new restaurant in town, but i also take tables and bartend. i’ve learned to juggle quickly! anyway this happened monday to one of my servers, but i intervened and got the meth line. 

3 people come in, 2 women and a guy, and immediately start talking about how overpriced our food is. our menu is al la cart and caters to the downtown crowd in my town who want modern and interesting food. they also said they were drunk, which i didn’t hear. the server that got stuck with their table is new and didn’t really think to turn them away because she wanted the business. 

anyway, from the bar i could hear them complaining our food wasn’t what they thought as they browsed the menu. they ordered so i didn’t think twice about it and kept busy making drinks. when the sever ran their food i saw one of the women getting upset and shoving her tray so i immediately stopped what i was doing and went over there. 

she claims she told the sever she was allergic to fish but my server was trying to serve her fish. the lady said she wanted everything on the fish dish minus the actual fish. i was confused and asked her to clarify and she threw a wadded up napkin down and said she wanted chicken. we have multiple chicken dishes so i asked her to clarify again. through trial and error, i managed to drag out what she wanted. 

meanwhile the guy with her, who i’ve now noticed is definitely drunk, starts waving his hand telling me to go away and that everything’s fine. i told them it wasn’t a problem and would be back with the dish she wanted. 

we have an open kitchen so i couldn’t ask the server about it without pulling her way back and she told me the lady was yelling at her, telling her our food was disgusting and she was disgusting. i decided to take care of the table as much as i could after because the sever definitely doesn’t need that abuse and it was uncalled for. 

i ran the lady her new food. she said “this is it?”. yes, that’s it. she wanted vegetables. pepper, specifically. i asked what kind and she yelled peppers again. i was like ok bell peppers? we don’t have those, they’re not authentic to the area our menu is from. she rolled her eyes and had me list every veggie i could get her. 

and i did. 

i ran her the sides of veggies that were specially prepped by the kitchen. she shoved the tray and asked for cheese. again, told her it wasn’t standard but got her cheese. 

5 minutes goes by and their server walks by and asks if they have room for dessert (she’s an angel and upsells like a champ). the woman all but throws her plate at the server and says she’s not paying. i walk over and the other woman gets up and says she’s leaving. 

at this point i’m full on arguing with this woman. what she didn’t eat, the guy ate. the only thing she didn’t eat was the chicken dish, which she chewed up and spit out in a napkin and shoved it in my chest while saying, “there’s your fucking chicken.”

at this point the guy tells her to shut the fuck yo and he leaves. i’m having a stare down with this woman. i told her she needs to leave. she crossed her arm and told me to call the owner because he wouldn’t dare stand for me to talk to a customer like that. i told her i’m more than capable but she kept insisting so i did. he asked what was going on and as i’m explaining she’s shouting, “that’s your story! bullshit! you’re such a liar! i’ll have you know i lived in (area where our menu is from) and they have peppers!”  my boss is confused and to get some peace i stepped in the kitchen - which is open, remember - and as i turned around i saw her hair whip and she was gone. 

there was a brief oh shit they didn’t pay the bill moment but to get them gone i was gonna swallow it. as soon as i hung up with my boss the two servers working came back and were like... “she stole the cup”. we have these speciality cups for one of our drinks and it’s an ooh and aww thing. anyway, she mixed all 3 cocktails on the table together and ran out the door. 

i went to bus the table and the guy comes back in and sits down to finish eating. i swallowed my pride and went over to apologize for raising my voice (mostly wanted to see if it was going to escalate again and try to get him to leave). he looked up at me and gave me this story about how she’s been with this guy who’s been beating her and he saw she was homeless on facebook and wanted to help his friend out. then he casually said, “i’m sorry, she’s on meth.” 

what.

 we're a smallish, family owned restaurant, 80% regulars and we do home delivery and take away too. now, one of our pick-up regulars is missing half an arm  and always comes in to get around 15 pizzas and the first time i served him, i asked him if i should open the door for him, because unfortunately our entrance doors open inwards (super annoying) and i actually ask this everyone who carriers their food out - and he had *a lot* of pizzas. he grunted ""no"" and left and a guy sitting on the bar who works with him and that i talk to  pretty often, said: ""well you offended him, he hates people offering him help"" so i thought about that and explained that i ask this everyone and that i don't plan on stop being friendly because it offends him.

but, the second time i served him i decided i'm just not gonna ask and already said ""enjoy your meal sir"" when my mum goes: ""well open the door, won't you"" , i looked at him, he smiled and said ""nah thank you, i'm fine"" so i replied ""alright then, thank you and have a good day"", he wishes me the same and walks to the door when other people who know him jump up and go ""hey lemme help you"" etc. , he says something in the line of ""nope"", but is still smiling and proceeds to walk out, actually carrying those 15+ pizzas better than some of our delivery guys would, so  i ask: ""hey, have you been working in service before?"" and he laughed and replied that he grew up in a bakery. i thought cool, think this was the right way to handle to situation, when i turn back to the restaurant and i realize people are looking at me like i'm the biggest asshole in the world, my mum's asking me what the fuck is wrong with me, so i explained it to her and she did understand it then. but the thing is: do i want to look like an asshole to everyone who doesn't get the situation, or am i cool with this one dude and just accept what makes him comfortable, no matter how it looks to other people? not that i care very much about what people think of me, but that could really piss some people off  and it's my job; but i don't want to do something that would definitely offend him, when i already know it does.",MrsLovettsPies,tfys

honestly i don’t get the obsession with booths. i understand that maybe you want a ‘cozier’ setting for your meal, but i know where i work the booths and tables are practically the same. the chairs are padded with the same material as the booths. the tables the same size. hell, we even have tables where you can sit side by side with your table-mates (like in a booth). your food will taste the same, it’ll come out the same time. so what’s the big deal???

we even get some people who are absolutely dead set on a booth and will wait an hour plus for one. or people who get upset when all the booths are taken by other diners. one table got pissed that our half booth, half table wasn’t all booth (for nine people? good luck). 

i just don’t get it. 

edit: i also just wanted to add, requesting a booth on a busy weekend night, even if you have a reservation, isn’t going to always pan out. you want a booth now? 10 other people specifically requested one when they made the reso a week ago, and while i’ll do my best to swap stuff i can’t promise you that i can give you a booth. 

secondly, sections aren’t always split evenly in my restaurant. we have a patio, a bar room, and the dining room— sometimes servers get 2 booths and 6 tables, or 4 booths and 4 tables, or 1 booth and 7 tables. we have to balance the amount of tables a server has with where the tables are in the restaurant (it would suck to have a section split over 3 areas). requesting a booth when i seat you at a table may throw off the rotation or tip the scales against a server, *particularly if the last four tables have requested a booth*. and although i try my best to account for this, i can’t make customers understand that no, you can’t have that booth, x hasn’t been sat in almost a half hour and it’ll mean y is triple sat. 

lastly, and this is more petty, but don’t wait until i’ve walked away from your table to chase me down and ask for a booth. if it’s so important, ask when you come to the host stand, not when you’re at your table. ",solaris-et-lunara,tfys
148,a warranted walk-out?,"(posting from mobile, but i'll try to make the format affable)

i've been working at a restaurant at a senior living community for almost a full year now. it has a casual style bistro area, a coffee shop/cafe area, and a fine dining style dining room. about a week ago, a new person started (they will be known as d). i met them yesterday and they seemed nice enough, which is why what they did earlier this morning is rather confusing to me.

for context, yesterday at lunch was extremely busy, probably the busiest i've seen yet. hence there were a lot of dishes by the time we were done with dinner. washing itself didn't take that long, but there were a good chunk of utensils that were not able to get ""polished"" (wiped down with a towel to remove any lingering water spots from the dishwasher). therefore, the manager told us to leave them for the openers to finish in the morning.

my co-workers filled me in when i came in for evening shift that apparently, when d came in this morning with the other opener, she wasn't happy about having to wipe off the utensils. the other opener was most likely one of the coffee shop people, since that opens before the restaurant by about an hour, so while they were brewing coffee d wouldn't likely have much else to do. this led to them making a statement about how all of us ""weren't working as a team"" and ""couldn't communicate""(?), and then they ended up walking out later that morning.

i'm try to by empathetic, as i don't know d personally and maybe something outside of the job contributed to this. i've walked out of a job myself in the past, but that was due to several issues that kept repeating themselves , not one instance. however, the more i mull it around in my head, i just can't see the logic here. you're faced with an extra task to do in the morning, something that, while tedious is pretty simple and easily done, but instead of at least trying you quit your barely week-old job entirely? i could be wrong though. has anyone else walked out on a job for something like this?",PenumbraVeil,tfys
149,anyone have that one customer...,"...that never fails to complain about something? (p.s. on mobile, apologies in advance)

the dreaded regular i have always, without fail, buys the biggest coffee she can. it's either 'not hot enough' or 'is this fresh?' or, the occasional, 'that looked pretty pale' in that nasally voice of hers. that last one in particular irks me because 1) normal coffee is not tar black when it's poured, everyone knows that and 2) our coffee has never changed in any way in the three years i've been here. the others are kinda dumb too, mostly because she comes in during peak time, so at most every pot of coffee (in thermal one mind you) is ten minutes old.

today she decided to find a new way to annoy us. today, she made me angry.
 
so like all our local sister stores, we have two windows (open all day everyday, except for rare exceptions) to move our drive-thru line quickly. today was one of those exceptions; the card reader back there stopped working, so we had closed the first window for about an hour. as luck would have it, it was during one of our early rush hours, when picky came through.

i was trying to quickly cash out someone at the widow when i heard her dreaded voice yell ""hello?"" at my speaker. before i could greet her (barely five seconds) i see her pull forward, just out of range for her to hear me. i sighed deeply before returning to the window where i juggled between order taking, cashing out, and handing out food. my co-worker focused mainly putting orders together so they didn't realise picky was here.

picky finally gets to my window two minutes later and complains, in that grating voice, that no one answered her and that she'll order here. right after she pays, she pretty much demands her coffee, while i'm taking another order. i kept my composure as i got it for her, no way i could fake it till i make it right then, and she speeds off like normal.

it took me a bit to calm down after that. then of course, my manager got the card reader sorted, and comes up front demanding to know why out times are so high. all i could say was that ""rude customers tend to do that"", with no reply.
 
tldr: regular rude customer comes through while we're backed up and orders at the window, and demands her stuff right after she gets her change.",TurkishValentine,tfys
150,need advice on opening my own place from servers who had made the leap from tipped employee to business owner!,"seeking advice/stories!

i've been working as a server for about 5 years.  i'm going to school for finance but i know that no matter what i'm going to end up working in the restaurant industry for the rest of my life.  i absolutely love it and i know it's something i'm good at!  i can schmooze, i know a lot about wine/beer/spirits, and i love working on my feet, talking to people and making people smile.  i'm a great cook as well (was a personal chef for 2.5 years) and am moving to california for 6 months at the end of april to work as a chef at a rural resort.

however, i don't want to be working for tips for the rest of my life.  i want to own my own business(es), probably a deli/market to start, and then maybe expand into catering or open a breakfast spot or whatever comes my way.  i'd like to hear from people in this group who went from working in restaurants to owning their own businesses.  i know it's probably a decade or two away for me, but what helped you succeed?  how did you learn about the accounting/financial aspect of owning a restaurant?  how did you find investors/a partner?  what did you do right?  what did you do wrong?  any advice is appreciated!  peace and blessings &lt;3",liverly,tfys
151,guy to drunk to enter the right door and recognise that he is not being arrested,"disclaimer: i was not present for the entire sequence of events, nor do i work at the place where this happened.

so this happened on “koningsdag” (kingsday) in the netherlands last year. as i am a student, a lot of my friends have jobs in hospitality (some part time, like me, others full time). on this particular day i did not have to work, as you probably know that national hollidays don’t count  as off days if you work in hospitality, and i was relieved. a friend of mine did have to work, and he works in the kitchen of a bar/café in the city centre of the city where i live. 

we decided that i would go to his work to pick him up when he was done (and of course, drink a beer there before going into the crowded bars). 

so when i arrive, there is this guy passed out next to the place where my friend works, surrounded by police officers. 

i go inside and one of my friend’s colleagues explains what happened (it happens quite often that i go pick up this friend before we go out, as he is often the first to get off work in our group of friends, so i know some of the other people working there). appearantly, this guy came into the bar/café and asked for a pizza with shoarma (shoarma: turkish kebab). the waiters just told him that he should go to the neigbours, the two places look nothing alike, just to give an idea of how absolutely pissed he was.

about half an hour later he walked past the restaurant (appearantly he found that pizza he was craving), and just collapsed. because of the holliday there was a lot of police present, who immediatly surrounded him to make sure he was ok and keep him safe. this was when i arrived. after about half an hour he woke up and upon seeing the police he starts screaming: “you can’t arrest me, let me go, i did nothing wrong” etc. the police were not detaining him at that moment, so he got up en walked/ran away.
 
the police just let him be, as he was not annoying/posing a danger to anyone.

tl;dr
guy runs in to a café wanting a pizza, he ment to go to the neigbours. leaves, later walks by and passes out, police surround him and he thinks he is being arrested eventhough he is not.

we got some bad news about one of our regulars today, an older woman. she's been visiting us on a weekly basis since before i started working there over 2 years ago. they told us that today would be her last visit with us. they're stopping chemo and she would be entering into hospice care after they left.

this is the first job i've had that really has regulars that you get to know and who get to know you. i didn't expect to be so affected by this news, but it was a rough shift after that. i'm thankful i found out before they left. i was able to catch them and give them a hug. i've had family members lose their battles with cancer and seen what that end stage looks like. my heart just hurts for her family and i hope things go smoothly for her.

i just wanted to express my appreciation. these ladies are some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet. they took the time to make valentine's for the whole front of house. they gave everyone super cute pens for christmas. getting the call that they were on their way was always a bright spot. they genuinely care about us as people, not just as employees. i remember posting a flyer for a concert i would be participating in and they'd always ask how rehearsals were going, that they were going to try and make it.  i'm sad that this was the outcome, but with all the awful customers we deal with, i wanted to share my experience with this amazing woman. we're definitely going to miss her.",notestasiskis,tfys

this is my friend, maple, and her nightmare shift, and i’m very glad i wasn’t on call this day.

she gets a text two hours before she clocks in from our coworker (let’s call her cindy) that she needs to clock in early. maple comes in to see the place is dead (not unusual). so there she is, standing around, cindy and our boss nowhere to be found

until the floodgates open

a mother and son walk in and ask for shaved ice. then the phone rings. maple takes the phone order first (it’s a higher priority). she hangs up and the phone rings again. suddenly, a swarm of hungry customers come in. 

maple is alone. cindy is still nowhere to be found.

about 30 minutes pass. maple is constantly writing orders. they never stop coming in. my god, she’s a soldier. the mother and son ask for a refund, but end up getting their shaved ice anyway. 

then the worst possible thing happens. 

we run out of teriyaki sauce. 

the people beg for their sweet nectar, but alas, there is none left. our boss comes in carrying raw slabs of meat on each arm, and puts a sign up on the door that breaks the hearts of the masses. 

“no more teriyaki sauce”

they still come in. they still beg for their sweet, sweet sauce. the udder is dry. no more teriyaki in this local japanese fusion restaurant.

161,racist customer demands i kick out a black woman,"for some context this lady is a semi-regular customer, whom i’ve served many times, she even asks for me when i am not working. being the only french employee i just assumed she’d rather speak in her native tongue. last week she made a fuss about my laos coworker making her food because « philipinos often are sick and dirty » . not wanting to escalate the situation i assured her i would make her food, and brushed off the racist remark. 

this week she comes in with outside food and starts eating. our cafe is very small with limited seating and we can’t allow this. she greets me with some small talk and i politely ask her to put the food away as if my manager saw she would be asked to leave. she happily agrees and packs her up her lamb chop and we continue our chat. a few minutes later i head to the back to grab some creamers and come back to her waiting for me looking very angry. 

while i was gone a black woman had come in and asked for a glass of water and had sat down at the next table over (i had only been gone around 2 minutes).  she starts berating me about why this woman was allowed to sit down and not order but she wasn’t (really don’t know where she got this from, i was very clear earlier that she was welcome to stay, just not eat her take-out from another place). i explain to her that i had no reason to believe she wouldn’t order, and that maybe she’s waiting for her friends or taking her time, after all she’d only been there less than 5 minutes. at this point she begins yelling at me, saying things like « she’s black! she won’t order, she probably cant pay for it! » as well as demanding i kick her out. i said i would wait 20 minutes and if she still hasn’t ordered i will talk to her. 

this wasn’t enough, however, as not even a minute goes by before she asks to see my manager. at this point i tell her i will call my manager over and excuse myself. my manager tries to reason with her to no avail, she calls me a racist for asking her to leave (again, i very clearly did not) and not the black woman. she also does the whole « i am a regular customer! i do not deserve this! » spiel. 

throughout this whole thing i really didn’t understand her argument, which made it even harder to reason with her, eventually i guess she got tired of yelling and stormed off.

here's where it gets fucking weird. we had a new busser join the team about a week or two ago, that i hadn't had the opportunity to work with yet. she's 18, young and impressionable, but also a smart, fast-learner. i immediately greeted her with a warm smile and introduced myself, then started talking about how i'd heard she was already doing such a good job around here. we're standing right in front of the bar, because that's literally the only place to stand (and i can see all the tables from there). so, mid-conversation, i heard this greasy dude pipe up from beside us, using my name i had *just said* to introduce myself. ""**sssssmile, darling**!!!"" he was holding his smartphone up and smiling like a kid on christmas morning. i'm like, *fuck no* on the inside, but on the outside- we both swivel to look at him in shock. i immediately began frantically waving my hands in front of the camera and blurted out **""please do not take my picture!""** the busser and i split ways, and i ran. all the way down the hallway and into the back room i went, standing there like a deer in headlights. *did that really just happen? who the fuck even does that? why would you do that? what was he planning on doing with my* ***goddamn picture****?* i was visibly shaken and the prep staff/dishwashers looked at me like i was having a panic attack (which happens at work sometimes, anxiety is real, so yk). ""are you okay?"" they asked. no. no i am not fucking okay. that poor busser and i spent the entire time he was eating crammed in the back hallway, feeling utterly disgusted/mortified. to make it more weird? it was supposedly this guy's birthday, and the male server waiting on him said there were six carrot cakes with candles reserved for him in the walk-in. we had to keep our distance for over an hour while he worked through his meal + birthday treats.   


after telling the other staff my story, they informed me that slimy raptor has come in before and harassed the barista women for choosing not to serve him and asking a male coworker to do it. he complained to our female boss about how the girls had ""offended him"" for refusing him service in a quiet manner. the baristas got in trouble for it, and he got to be entitled and full of himself. if he ever comes in again, i will absolutely refuse to engage with him and maybe even report his inappropriate behavior.

173,$2.33/hour for a 50+ full service party,"this place i used to work for had an outside seating area that was popular to rent out for parties. no reservation fee, but there was a food and beverage minimum based on the day and time (higher dinner and weekend costs) plus 18% gratuity, and if the party didn’t meet the minimum, the difference would be added on as a “service fee”. 

this special party did not get any of those. every week for the entire football season, the outside dining area would be filled with middle and high school football players, their families, and the coaches, for a weekly radio show. full service, full menu, split tabs, and no added gratuity because “it looks bad”.

again, full service, but you seat yourself outside so kids split up away from parents and constantly moved seats, we had three servers and an extra hostess on that party, we were expected to keep track of of every separate tab and hunt down parents for payment (lots of dine and dash incidents happened, or parents would go inside to the bar for drinks and tell the bartender to put it on their tab outside). 

this all took 3 hours on a good day, that being if the inside dining was empty. but on a normal day there were 4 servers, a hostess, and a bartender inside, full house with a waitlist, plus 3 servers and a hostess outside. but even then, servers inside would get 2 tables each for a 6 hour shift because our parking lot couldn’t even handle the cars from our building being full.

our kitchen had one flat top and two fryers. 
our sever alley had one drink machine, a bin of ice (the actual ice machine was across the restaurant and through the kitchen), and two runs of tea. 
all of this just to stress how small this place was.

nobody wanted to work this party. servers would take this specific shift off of their availability or call out. this party was awful to deal with, took away any chance for having tables inside and thus were the only party for any server working it that night, and they didn’t fucking tip. we (the ones usually stuck with them) did the math and were making $7 each off of a 50+ top over 3 hours. more, actually, since we had to set up the outside area and break it down at the end of the night. 

the kitchen would get overwhelmed with tickets because there’s only one expo and 30 something tickets coming back at once, plus whatever tickets from the regular inside diners. 

turns out the restaurant was losing money on them too. the radio host, coach, coaches immediate family, and star player all got free meals. between that and the people leaving without paying, it added up fast. 

but nothing changed for the entire football season. every tuesday night you’d show up knowing damn well you’re not making anything that night. turns out the owners kid went to the school and they wanted it to be a show of good faith or support for the schools team? idk 

the next year servers found out the owner offered the team the same deal and got together with management to work out some better terms, like setting up buffet style or offering a limited menu so the kitchen can have a better grasp of how much and what to prep. the owner didn’t believe it was that bad, and the first night the people working it got $3 each. after that, a gentle reminder was given to the radio host to remind the families to tip, and severs were allowed to add 18% gratuity to checks if every server working it agreed (it was unanimous every time). after that, servers started making $25 each. kitchen still had to deal with all the separate tickets though, no limited menu was offered. 

still sad, but a good friday night for that place was only $70-$90 (the turnover for this place was stupidly high. we’d get waves of new hires and maybe one would stay past a month)

tl;dr absolutely horrible setup fucks over kitchen and servers for 17 weeks, owner didn’t believe they were only getting $7 from a party of over 50, took a year before servers were allowed to add 18% tip to the bills",Johameson,tfys
174,"chicken parmesan, but without the parmesan","i want to preface this by saying that i’m not that angry, this is mostly being posted for laughs. but fuck this lady. 

so this summer, i was working at a carnival for my school. it was volunteer work, and i worked as a cashier. 

i was doing well, and this one lady comes up to me. basic white lady, short curly hair, and the like. she comes up to me and orders a chicken parmesan sandwich, without the cheese and sauce. i say, “ok ma’am, so a chicken sandwich?” “no, i want a chicken parmesan without the cheese and sauce”. “you do know that it will be the same thing as a chicken sandwich, but more expensive?” ($1.25 more expensive, in fact.) she repeats what she said earlier, but louder and ruder. calls me stupid/deaf, and says she’s not going to repeat herself.

so i’m like, ok. i’ll give you what you’re asking for. i mark her down for a chicken parmesan, i collect her money, and i tell the food runners to give her a plain chicken sandwich. i hand it to her, and she says “this is exactly what i wanted! thank you! see, it’s not that hard to give the customer what they want.”

this was a year ago, and i still want to tear out my eyes and fling them at that lady. at least she didn’t get mad at the price. 

tl;dr: idiot lady orders chicken parmesan without cheese and sauce. i give her a plain chicken sandwich and charge her for chicken parmesan, she accepts it happily.",spnkat,tfys
175,"you work at the restaurant across the street from this store, so let me cut you in line!!","there’s a walgreens right across the street from where i work. 

i go there after getting off in the afternoon to pick up a few things. i’m standing in checkout, next in line. i get called up, only to have some lady rush and cut in front of me, doing a little half-walk half-run to get to the register first. she also had way more stuff than me!

“excuse me, miss, i was next, sorry!” i say  very politely, with a smile on my face. the cashier backed me up and said he would get her after he got me. she was annoyed but stood back so i could check out. 

i was parked in the restaurant parking lot so as i’m going to my car she runs to catch up to me and says she noticed my uniform and how i work at “‘restaurant.” she then told me as an employee at a local business i shouldn’t have “talked back to her” and been so rude, and she was entitled to cut me in line and check out 🙄

i’m not being paid to take shit at this point, so i’m like “ok yeah sure, sorry.” she got upset, saying i was giving her more attitude. she also said she was going inside the restaurant to complain to my boss and tried to fucking grab me by my hand to make me go with her.

i just yanked my hand away, gave her a mean look and left. i didn’t listen to anything else she said, i mean she just kept running her mouth all the way until i pulled out of the parking lot.

i called my manager when i got home to find out what happened and nobody went in to complain about me. my manager thought it was both hilarious and rediculous at the same time and it was.

178,"""is it decaf?""","so i work in a small coffee shop, which is frequented by a whole host of interesting characters.

recently a middle aged couple has been coming in once a week and they sit and hangout for awhile.

now just a disclaimer: i understand when people double-check their order. like, if they have a sugar or milk intolerance, and they make sure to confirm with us that we made their latte with almond milk or something. i understand that they need us to be hyperaware of this, because one small mistake can lead to a bunch of discomfort on their part. this isn't a problem.

now, this couple takes this to the extreme. the husband usually orders for him and his wife. he gets a house coffee and she gets a double decaf pumpkin pie latte. i ring them up, and i repeat the order back to him.

me: ""alright, so just a house coffee and a decaf latte.""

husband: ""you are making it decaf right?""

me: ""yes, sir.""

at this point i'm not mad or anything about him asking me, even though i already stated that the latte was decaf, because hey, better safe than sorry. but then as i am tamping down her decaf espresso, he comes back up to the bar and asks ""it's decaf right?""

so, i'm like ""yeah, this is decaf espresso.""

he seems satisfied with my reply so he returns back to his table. we've established that it is decaf multiple times at this point, so i'm a little annoyed, but i just thought that they are probably being extra cautious because maybe they had a bad experience in the past.

so i walk to their table with both coffees in hand, and i say ""here is the house coffee for you, sir, and here is your decaf pumpkin latte.""

husband: ""it's decaf right?""

yes it is decaf. at this point i'm pretty annoyed, like it's decaf , i just established this multiple times. the real kicker is is that they come in **multiple times** a week and we do this dance every. single. time. like i'm not trying to poison you, please give me a little credit.

179,lunch break shenanigans,"on mobile yada yada... 

this took place last summer but now that it’s getting warm again i’m remembering this odd interaction i had with a customer while i was on my lunch break.  nothing too crazy or upsetting, just odd. 

where i work we don’t have a break room so we sit at one of our outdoor seating tables for our lunch whenever it’s nice out. well, that’s just what i was doing this particular day. 

most all customers are regulars and we know each other well (small town problems), so customers know that if an employee is sitting outside, we’re on our break. most are nice and either say nothing or a quick hi. 

but this lady, on this day decided that how i was acting was unprofessional. i was sitting at a table, ear bud in to deter conversation, and scrolling through my phone. she walked past me, stopped and asked how my day was, nothing too unusual. 

until she asked why i was on my phone. i politely explained that i was on my lunch break. she in turn says something along the lines that because customers can still see me it is unprofessional and rude to be on my phone despite me being on break. basically i need to be available to customers at all times. 

i didn’t get a chance to say anything because she just turned and left. it was an odd moment, but i happily continued my lunch and finished my shift. 

me and my coworkers still share a laugh over this one from time to time. ",Wahale1224,tfys

181,at what point is the customer not 'always right'?,"first for context:
i serve and bartend at a large family restaurant in a wealthy suburb, which often attracts very entitled individuals who believe they're here for a fine dining experience. 

it's a quiet monday lunch, a couple waiters on with not much to do. about 15 minutes until we close, a couple walks in. they already look the type that will kick up a fuss. they order a large grazing platter that could easily serve 4, and a bottle of wine. 

10 minutes after ordering, as the platter is practically finished and ready to send - they tell one of our newer waitresses that they are in a hurry and don't want it anymore as it is too much food. whilst usually we may let this slip, this is a large $80 platter that they were trying to get out of paying for. we told them they had to pay, but that we were happy to separate the platter into takeaway boxes for them. she said no, and that they will eat it. the husband gets up and leaves, and she informs us that he is leaving to pick up their son and bring him here. at this point we had closed, and they were the last people in the restaurant. she also asks us to put the platter away in the fridge until they return. it doesn't really fit in the fridge but we find a way. 

30 minutes past close, the man returns with their kid. we inform them that we are now closed and that we will put the platter in a pizza box for them to takeaway. they kick up a fuss but agree. i hand them the pizza box and return to cleaning up the restaurant. 10 minutes later, after half the platter has been eaten (they never got up to leave) she tells us that one of eight items on the platter was terrible. this item would ofcourse taste terrible cold but they insisted on it being fridged earlier. she insists on a discount, and we comp 25% just to get her to pay and leave. 

at 50 minutes past close we ask again that they leave, and they grumpily get up to leave and instead sit down on one of our outside tables, with their platter and wine. she asks me to throw out the platter as it was terrible, and asks for a free icecream for her son as compensation. just to get her to leave, we again appease her. they sit outside until about 4:15 (we close at 3). i finally get to clean up the mess and go home. i had missed an important meeting with my landlord because of this and i am still beyond agitated over it.

185,ice cream cones are tough,"so today at work, i was at the register, which is highly unusual for me, since i typically work in the back or the kitchen. it was even more unusual because when i've been on register before, it was only for an hour or a hour and a half at most. today, i was on register for my entire shift. granted it was only four hours. in any case, it was a change, and i didn't do so well with handling it.

part of my responsibilities were to take orders, make drinks which include shakes and frosted beverages, and give out condiments and sauces. so there's a good bit to do, especially when it is in the middle of a rush, even a small one. then when the guest has a huge long order that's as confusing as watching a monkey eat a golf club, it's even harder, especially since i rarely work the register. anyway, now that i have given a little background, i shall proceed to the little anecdote that inspired this post and title.

so i was in the middle of a small rush. i had just finished making a few shakes for an order i had made. anyway, i walked by the food pickup area, and there was a lady and her son. she stopped me saying ""i am still waiting on an ice cream cone.""

i asked her what size. as she was riffling through her bag, she said ""i could have sworn i put the receipt in here.""

i said ""i can check what it was.""

on the pos screen, there was only one cone, which was a small, which means i gotta put two swirls of ice cream on the cone. so i proceed to make the cone, and it comes out lopsided. i apologize to the lady for the lopsidedness, and she asks if i can make it again, fill the entire cone, and put a little more ice cream on it. i make it again, and it's not lopsided now, but it's still not filling the cup entirely. she still isn't satisfied, and at this point, i gave up, and asked one of the more experienced employees to take care of it.

the two unsatisfactory cones were given to co-workers in the back who wanted them. i messed up so many times that day that not only did i give away those cones, but also coffee, and probably other things that i can't remember now.

i hope it's a long time before they put me up there again. or if they are planning on putting me up there with any frequency, they should put me up there at least once a week so that i can get used to it.",yeoldtimeho,tfys
186,"you’re a waitress, it doesn’t matter what restaurant we’re in","x-post from r/idontworkherelady

on my day off i scheduled a lunch date with a guy from school. 

traffic was brutal so he was running late. i was sitting at my table, looking at the menu (note: this is not the restaurant i work at, it isn’t the same kind of food as the restaurant i work at, it is geographically nowhere near the restaurant i work at.)

a woman came up and took my menu out of my hands. 


“why are you just sitting here? we’ve been waiting for service for 45 minutes.” 

no they hadn’t. they came in the same time i did, ten minutes ago, and they had already gotten drinks. 

“ma’m, i don’t work here.” 

i didn’t recognize her at this point. 

“don’t lie to me, you’re a waitress, you served me just last week don’t you remember?”

i vaguely remember her coming into my restaurant now because she complained her meal wasn’t served with hot sauce then sent it back because it was too spicy. 

“i am a waitress at *local mexican restaurant* but i am not a waitress at *”local burger bar”*. “ 

she says ”same difference. you’re a waitress. get a pen and paper and take down our orders.”

“i am a waitress, but not here. i’m just trying to enjoy my lunch like you are. i am not employed here in any capacity.” 

to which she replies “but you’re a trained waitress and this place is clearly running behind. don’t you people take an oath or something?” 

a little bit of r/maliciouscompliance kicked in, because i rarely get to stand up to this kind of stupidity in my role as a server, because 99.9% of the time it happens while i’m actually at work. 

so i went over to their table with a pen and paper from my backpack. i wrote down all their orders. i said it would be 45 minutes and to just sit tight. i even brought over ketchup they asked for (just grabbed off another table) then....... i left. 

i texted my date to meet me at a place a few blocks over. 

the next day, the lady had called my boss at my actual restaurant, as well as totally unleashed on the manager at the restaurant i was dining at (i felt bad when i realized the tough spot i’d left the people who actually work there in, so went back the next day to apologize and follow up on the aftermath. thankfully they were chill and we had a great laugh over it.) 

they were like “we were so confused because she described the server with explicit details but no one remotely like that works here so we thought she’d lost her mind.” 

my boss knew who i was from her description and told them he takes this very seriously and asked what day this occurred. then when they told him he said “you must be mistaken, because that’s that server’s day off and she wasn’t here.” after some irate yelling and screaming at my very friendly manager about how i still need to “represent the restaurant wherever i go” she gave up.

this ended up being really long, because i'm an awful writer. tl;dr at the end, sorry about that!

our cast is cw - coworker, me - myself, dl - dumb lady, and ds - dumb lady's dumb son. dl is about 75 and ds looks 30ish. anyway, on to the story.

this happened only a few days ago, so it is still fresh in my mind. me and cw are hosts, and for those of you who don't know, we primarily meet and seat the guest(s). friday nights are sometimes hit or miss in regards to business, and this friday was very relaxed. 

before i get further, i want to explain the setting. when we seat people, we bring with us the menus and silverware to the table. the menus are stored on a rack on the wall, and the silverware is in bins behind the host podium. after guests place their order, the server takes their menus and puts them in these holders that are near the kitchen, to which us hosts take, sort, and put back in the racks.

the busiest time had just ended, so me and cw were sorting through menus, when two customers walk in. cw is behind the podium, while i'm at a table behind it working on even more menus. i have different strategies with each coworker while hosting, and cw was no exception. ours was basically whoever was behind the podium had to greet and seat the guests, so when these two came up, i didn't think much of it. 

the next bit comes from cw, and is where the issue began. 

cw - ""hi, how many?""

it was two, but we always ask, because they might be meeting someone.

dl - *silence*

cw - ""... two?""

dl - *more silence and staring*

cw - ""okay...?""

ds - *very quietly* ""yes, it's two.""

cw turns around to grab silverware, takes two of the recently sorted menus from the podium, and looks for a seat using the computer.

dl - *mumbles*

cw - ""sorry, could you repeat that?""

dl - ""he's not even listening to me.""

cw - ""sorry, ma'am. i couldn't hear you over the music. could you just repeat what you said?""

at this point, i was by the menu racks with my sorted menus, putting them in. i was only half listening at this point, because i didn't really know anything was happening.

dl - ""why would i say something to someone who won't even listen?""

ds - ""it's just two, it's not that hard to understand."" (i honestly don't think he was paying attention)

cw is just dumbfounded at this point. i'm almost done putting menus away, and i hear dl.

dl - ""maybe he'll listen.""

at this time, a server comes up to tell me something over my shoulder, so i'm listening to her because it's important. at the same time, a random kid comes up to me and hands me menus for some reason. i wasn't necessarily overwhelmed by the situation, but it was pretty confusing. at this point, i'm looking over my shoulder at the server, to hear what shes saying.

dl, while i'm not looking mind you, quietly says something about not being in the middle. this'll be important in a moment.

me - ""i'm sorry ma'am, could you repeat that?""

dl - ""he's not listening either!""

me - *realizing the situation* ""no ma'am, i apologize. a coworker was speaking to me, could you kindly repeat what you said?""

dl - ""i'm not going to explain something to someone who doesn't care!""

i look at ds, hoping that i could reason with him, but is just standing there with a blank, yet stern expression.
i then look at cw, and he looks as dumbfounded as i feel.

ds - ""look, it's just two, it's not that hard.""

the next part is very fogy because i have an awful memory, but it ends up going like this:

dl - ""look, i just want whoever is more competent to take us.""

me - *ignoring her, to cw* ""ill' take em.""

at this point, i'm standing in the dining room, which is separate from where the podium is. in order to get to the podium to select a seat, i have to walk back. dl, however was standing right between these two points. older people do this sometimes, and it's annoying, but i put up with it because i understand that they're older. i was done with these two, however, and i make my way past dl and back to the podium, selecting their table.

me - ""alright, you can follow me."" *i grab the silverware and menus from cw, and head off, with dl and ds trailing behind.

dl - ""it's like everyone here is deaf!""

me - *turning around* ""sorry ma'am, i was speaking to a coworker.""

i was going to say more, but i realized they weren't paying attention.
we get to the table, and it's almost over, but no. i set their stuff down on the table, and look up at them, who are now just standing in the center of the main path. it wasn't busy because it was getting late, but it still blocks servers and traffic.

i look at ds, hoping that he would do anything. nope, still a blank expression. i stare at them for five seconds, and step back.

me - ""alright, enjoy guys"" i instinctively say that to everyone, and this event was no exception. i then made my way back to the podium. it took another 15 seconds before they finally went to the table and sat down.

i went back and told cw what the entire issue was about. i had somehow heard the word ""middle"", and i almost instantly knew what they wanted. we always get people that ask for a seat by the wall, and they were no exception. i went to the kitchen and the server from earlier explained how they always do that, and they were ""dumb as anything"" i felt like i have seen them before, but i never had to directly interact with them.

(the manager never called him one, just said they need to tone it down) other customers start coming in as they're yelling and show casing how intoxicated they were. yelling to get their point across, demanding my manager's number, name and questioning several staff if displaying how you love your wife is inappropriate. the answer from all of us being yes at how they acted. eventually it lead with them leaving stating they'll comeback to see the security tapes to prove they're in the right. also with us calling the police on them, since they were driving clearly drunk. as of now, that's all i know, i might update if they actually come in with the district manager

193,"*points at two dollar bills* ""here's your tip!!""","tl;dr: a very difficult table made a huge deal about putting down 2$ on a 115$ check for my tip to get a reaction from me.

so, a couple weeks ago, i'm working my first floor shift in weeks (i'm mainly behind the bar) and i'm feeling great, killin' it, getting along with all my tables, crushing large parties, just having a grand old saturday night shift. and then i get this 5 top, that immediately i can tell are going to be a problem. they just give off that vibe, you know? and boy, was i right. 

i'll try to keep it brief, but every visit to the table was an issue. i work an an eclectic tapas restaurant, so it can be confusing for new comers, but i do my best to explain how things work to every table, especially this one. i was killing myself with how patient and kind i managed to be, despite being asked numerous times if we had things we don't carry (read the menu), getting disgusted looks/responses when i apologize for not having certain food items,  such as chicken wings, ""ewww"" responses from the teenage girls when i describe dishes. then, when i finally coaxed them into ordering, they are ordering things we don't have (did you even look at the menu??). it was just a mess. but i took their order cheerfully and kept drinks full until food arrived. 

they were pretty fine during the meal, except for the old lady who didn't like one of our most popular and tasty dishes that most people say is the best around. but whatever, everyone else likes it so i don't have to send it back. i ask them about dessert, we have an amazing in house pastry chef who makes the most fantastic creations from scratch. the mom asks if i can bring out a ""dessert tray"", i'm assuming like one from the 80's where you pick out what dessert you want based on looks? and she's upset when i apologize that no we don't have that. they end up ordering a creme brûlée and our yummy house made coconut sorbet with dark chocolate and berries for the vegan girl. 

well, vegan girl doesn't like her desert. turns out she doesn't even like coconut. hmm. manager goes over, smooths things over, takes dessert off bill (which i might add is very rare, we don't usually do that for most cases). i'm so ready to get this table outta here i don't even care. i bring them their check, 115$. honestly not expecting much from them. as i walk by them on my way to another table, i pickup the credit card and see two dollar bills on the table, and one teenage girl points to them vigorously and says ""hey! thats your tip!"" i'm pissed so i just ignore her and keep walking, hear them all laughing as i walk away. i'm just keeping it cool. 

i drop the check back off, thank them all *so much* for coming in, have a great night! big smile. and teenage girl, again, because i didn't give her the satisfaction last time, picks up the two dollars and waves them at me ""hey heres your tip!!"" 

so i just look at her and smile and say ""thank you so much!"" and finish taking care of all the tables in my section. their whole table is laughing at me at that point. i was feeling pretty boiling mad and told my coworkers about it in the kitchen, who couldn't believe someone would behave like that. one sweetheart bought me a fat shot of don julio as a consolation. 

then my manager walks over and says they left me another 20$ bill, and they were just trying to make me laugh. bitch, no, they weren't trying to make me laugh, they were trying to make themselves laugh! they were trying to upset me by showing off a shitty tip and i'm assuming, hurt my feelings? it was so rude and hurtful and i really did a great job with a difficult table, i just couldn't believe it. it was like the opposite of those people that give servers really big tips to see their reaction. fuck em.",pootsycollins69,tfys
194,i'm pretty convinced our owner hates servers.,"i'm still upset from last night, so sorry if i'm all over the place. i tried to keep it short, but i just had to went. tia to all taking time to read. 


a little background for ya folks: i work part time at a fancy rooftop bar and sushi restaurant somewhere in germany. been here since november last year after being in the industry for several years, so nothing much can upset me anymore.

the place is part of a family run business that also includes another bar downtown and some real estate. the owner, let's call him b, his kids and close family friends run the whole organisation and office stuff. we do not have a manager in the usual sense, we're a team of all trained and/or experienced bartenders, servers and chefs and it's a small place, so we figure things out ourselves.


now, b will come in more or less every evening to check on things, have some business meetings or do whatever. totally fine.

i thought for a long time maybe he just didn't warm up to me yet, as i'm still the ""new girl"" (many of the others have been working for him for years and are close to the family). no biggie. 

then i thought maybe he just doesn't like me. fine, we're professionals, i can deal with that.

after talking to a coworker last night i think i finally figured it out, for whatever reason b just hates us servers. 


let me elaborate.

b always finds something to criticise. that's legit, it's his place and he wants to keep standards high. but if he doesn't find something, he goes to look for aomething like, i need to wipe the glass door right now during rush hour because there's some finger prints on it. the ipad we use to put in orders is filthy, how disgusting, wipe that down right now. i'm not supposed to use the fancy, expensive napkins on him (""uh, yeah, i know, i wasn't the one that set the table for you"" - ""oh. okay. but still remember for next time.""). i catch him going off on someone else about how we always need to have a microfiber cloth at hand, only for me to step in to explain i litterally had taken it to wipe down a table (""oh. okay then."")

but here's the deal. he only does that to the servers. never with the bar or kitchen staff.

he'll walk straight past me without a word, say goodbye to the guys in the kitchen on his way out (kitchen has a window to the service station, so i hear it) and leave. he'll be sat at the restaurant for 3 hours with some business partners, several course meal and drinks, all for free of course so fuck tips, and then disappear without saying thank you or bye. (of course after criticising me at several points on how i was serving them)

and while most of the time it's small things, sometimes he'll just blow.
like last night when he went complete apeshit on me because i dared touch our chef's gfs dog when we had arab guests in (sanitation was kinda a thing, but certainly not his main concern). or the other time he very much audibly belittled my coworker in front of our guests, some of whom then got up to leave shortly after. or the other time our other server was crying hysterically at the restaurant before opening after being chewed out for, well, i don't even know what for.

and again, it's only ever us servers.

and it hurts my soul, because i love the place, i love all the the guys and gals but man, i'm not down to putting up with that. and after last night, i'm honestly considering leaving because, let's be real, serving jobs aren't exactly a rarity. ",zuckergoscherl,tfys
195,i never really noticed casual racism until i hired a black man as a waiter at my restaurant.,"i live in a fairly white town. our craft beer restaurant has had a following since we opened. our demographic tended to be older white men, but recently we’ve attracted the millennial crowd in increasing numbers. 

i became the front of house manager about two years ago. i hired the crew we have currently and they have amazing chemistry with each other and customers. 

last fall i hired a young african american man. i wouldn’t say his race was even consciously considered by me and he has been by no means incompetent in his job. there are occasional reminders and constant gentle pressure given towards certain areas of improvement, but that’s how it goes with all of my staff. 

however, complaints about his service have been disproportionate compared to all our other servers. 

example: “that kid over there is talking to someone when he should be bringing our drinks.” well okay, that someone is the business owner and when i checked the ticket they had been waiting for their drinks for about two minutes. they got their drinks about 30 seconds later. 

example 2: someone flagging me down about a server standing there doing nothing... it was him putting in a large order at our pos terminal. 

there have been about 6 or so instances of this in the past two months. and you know what’s common about these complaints? they’re all coming from boomer generation white men. 

now there are issues such as a meal item being wrong, but those types of errors are almost evenly distributed across all staff. but these complaints about standing around, meandering, are always directed towards him, and when i check on the issue he’s always doing something job related. hell the guy has about a 100% record for coming in when called in or asked to stay late. he has a great work ethic. 

but jesus fucking christ it’s interesting and very sad to see some of the shit i’m sure many african americans have to put up with.

196,my manager has a very bad habit,"i work at a well-known chain restaurant as a host and we’re basically in low season at the moment, so most shifts have been very slow. so yeah, most servers and managers get sad and bored, since there’s barely anything to do.

so one of the managers (let’s call her clara), is well-known for  making super early  massive  cuts (before or during rush hour) because she likes to assume that the rest of the turn will be slow and she says that it will make the rest of servers make more money in a slow shift.

by massive cut, i mean leaving 3 or 4 servers in a restaurant where the max capacity of people is somewhere along 200. 

so, we obviously get horrible slammed, regardless of how the shift is (busy or not). i have to put an unnecessary waiting list, even though there are plenty of tables available and cut servers that can take those tables, but i can’t over-sit the  few remaining servers, so i have to deal with screaming and angry customers asking me why is there a waiting list. plus, the remaining servers get unnecessary slammed and they end up providing a slow and bad service. 

one day, i decided to ask a close friend of clara why does she make such risky cuts that end up turning a slow shift into chaotic one. she told me that clara loves when the restaurant is slammed, because then everyone and herself are busy running around.

is it worth it though? when all you do is end up messing up the service and making customers angry? i know servers who love working in a rush, but there’s a difference between a good rush (when you’re running around but you’re still doing everything nicely) and a bad rush ( too much to handle).

also, as a host, i hate it will all my heart, because, when the rush is finally over, servers end up with insane tips, while i end up the same since i don’t get tips and l’m on minimum wage, even though i also got horribly slammed.",SpookyCrow86,tfys

198,you ever put a customer in their place and give yourself a little justice boner?,"this was a couple weeks ago. i got sat a two top, but i couldn’t get to them right away, because i was greeting another table, effectively being double sat. after finishing up what i was doing, i started to walk back out to greet them (two minutes), and i noticed they didn’t have menus. i did a 180 and i go back to the server station and ask if anyone got to 22 yet, perhaps picking it up on accident and took their full order. nope. okay, so one of two options: 

1. they already know what they want and didn’t need menus. 

2.  they sat themselves.

i think about this for a moment and i’ve never seen them before so they couldn’t be regulars. turn back. they look a bit agitated, so i head over there quickly. 

“hi folks, how are you doing?”

lady: “we’re great, can we have waters?” 

“yes i can do that. and i see you don’t have menus so do you already know what you’re having, would you like to get started?” 

there’s a long pause. solid eye contact with the lady. her mouth opens a little. closes again. finally, i break the silence.

“oh, did those hosts not bring you any menus? you’d be surprised how often they do that! i’ll go grab you some and tell them to do better.”

finally the lady looks like she has come back down from the stratosphere. 

“oh, we sat ourselves.”  ah there it is. “we’ll just go back to the hosts” yes you will.

i felt so proud of myself because 6 months ago i would’ve just been like “it’s :) fine :) you :) can :) stay :)”

199,an open letter to the nicest people i’ve ever served.,"(obligatory “i’m on mobile” speech so sorry for formatting, yadda yadda yadda.)

you weren’t overly friendly. you weren’t rude or obnoxious. from an outside perspective you were a nice and easy table but we didn’t particularly “hit it off” in that way. it’s your actions in the face of my failure that truly set you apart from anyone i’ve ever served and i haven’t forgotten about your kindness. 

i was working at a chain restaurant that’s popular in the southern portion of our state. generally known for good food and fast service, especially on a weekday night. i was closing the dining room and was taking my break while another server was watching my section. i returned from my break around 8:45 and i only had 2 tables. one that was finishing up that i started before my break, and another new table, you guys. the server that was watching my section assured me that he had taken their order and i didn’t have to worry. condiments were down and i gave you guys refills and you were happy. 

when 9 o’clock rolled around, it was finally happy hour, but only in the bar. i stayed on just in case there was overflow and there usually wasn’t. but on this particular day, we became extremely busy because of a hockey game that just finished (my restaurant is across the street from a hockey stadium). the place filled up and there was only 2 servers and 2 bartenders on, so needless to say we got busy fast. 

at this particular restaurant we had food runners that took our food out for us and i hate to admit that i relied too much on them to bring your food and forgot to check up on you. it was one of the dumbest things i’ve done in all my years of serving. i’ve never just plum forgot about a table but i forgot about you. it wasn’t until around 9:45 (an hour after i got back from my break, and an hour and 10 minutes from when your food was supposedly put in by the server who watched my section while i was on break) that i had that small panic attack that hit right down to my gut when i realized i hadn’t been by your table in almost an hour. 

to my horror, you didn’t have plates on your table and your drinks were bone dry. i’d asked if your food came, you both said no, and while you both smiled at me one of you said “we could see how busy you got! we didn’t want to be a bother”. um, what? you should have gotten your food 45 minutes ago! you wouldn’t have been a bother in the slightest. i explained that to you guys and you both assured me it was okay. 

i of course got your order again and went to my manager. he was pissed at me for forgetting for that long. at that point, i’m just as bad as the guy who broke me. he forgot to put in the order, and i never checked up on you. i’d be pissed too! he of course comps your entire meal, apologies profusely, gets your food out as quick as humanly possible and sends you off with a free desert. you both assured me the entire time that you’re not upset, and we didn’t need to comp your meal. i felt so awful and you were both so sweet, and after so long in the industry i didn’t think people like you existed. your kindness and understanding of human error was so refreshing and sweet and made me realize that there are still good people in this world. but what you did next brought literal tears to my eyes because i wanted to hug you both but you left before i could. 

you guys left a hundred dollar bill for me at the table and a note that said “bad days happen to us all, please don’t beat yourself up. we had a great night and think you did an amazing job handling that crazy rush!” 

i never saw you again and sometimes wonder if you were angels. i know that sounds cheesy and dramatic but i had just lost my dad and returned to work about 2 months before. days were hard and i was sad and you both lifted me in a way i can’t explain. kindness can go a long way and i’ll never forget you guys. 

remember to treat everyone you meet with kindness. you never know who might be having a hard time, and they might just remember your kindness for the rest of their lives.

200,angry guest yells at almost whole staff cause she can’t find her server.,"this happened this morning and it was just a tad ridiculous. 

i was standing at the pos putting in an order, it was starting to die down so at least four other servers were around me just talking. crazy lady (cl) comes outta nowhere and yells, “who’s the server in this area?!” i asked, “well where are you sitting?” she points at a booth and i check the board (we have a board over our pos so i checked right in front of her) and told her the server’s name and continued ringing in my order. 

she then goes, “well which one of you is it?!” and we all say in sync, “none of us.” she said, “go get me my server and a manager!” she walks off to the restroom and a coworker goes to find the server. i look at her table and they already have appetizers and other things at the table so her server has obviously been by already, so she should know what her server looks like (but of course no one ever pays attention to their servers, let alone what they look like). turns out the server forgot their drinks so she apologized and got them right out. 

fast forward to the end of their meal, it’s slow and shift change is happening so we have morning and night servers hanging out at the pos and she counts out loud how many servers she passes and yells, “that table needs their check. now!” 

i didn’t see her again after that but the server said it was just her acting that way. one coworker was passing out food at the table next to them and cl made a comment to her and the person she was with told her to stop/calm down. another coworker was in the restroom when cl walked in and she asked her what her section was, so she told her she was in the bar area and the woman stormed out. she seemed like she was just trying to get attention over nothing, her family left right away, most likely embarrassed, and left the server $10.",catsavvyy,tfys

203,a happy story!!,"hello! long time lurker, first time poster, and on a smartphone so bear with me. i also apologize for the wall of text, there’s a summary at the end!

i have been working for a wonderful family-owned restaurant/bar for about two years now, and this is a first for me. i really wanted to share because these people were so kind and they deserve some recognition for how awesome they were. 

let’s set the scene. i was waitressing. it was a slow night and the people who came in were not... the best tippers, if that is okay to say (i’m talking 10% and below on $20-40 checks).  i’m not trying to sound money hungry or anything, but your girl has got to eat and pay bills. most of the patrons who were coming in were really rude and needed a lot and talked down to me, which did not help my mood. i was the closer that night, so i cut all the other waitresses, and took the few tables that wandered in. 

it was 25 minutes until the kitchen closes when two young women walked in. i sat them at a booth, carded them, joked about the out of state license, and got their drinks. they were really kind from the start, joking and explaining this was their night out so they needed to go crazy. i got them settled and went to go check on my only other table, which had cashed out. 

i went to collect the credit card slips and cash tips lying on the table when one of the patrons asked for another beer. i told her the price and she said to me, “just take it out of your tip.” i was confused and angry. i almost started crying since i already had hardly any money in my pocket to begin with, and this woman told me to take money for her drink out of the tips that she left me. i know it sounds bratty, and i get that it’s her money, but please don’t put a cash tip on my clipboard and then tell me to pay for a drink with it, especially when you call them my tips to begin with. 

i went back to check on my other table and served them their food. my mood was back to sad, so i started to joke with the pair again. we chatted and laughed, one girl got another drink, and we were getting along really well. my night was improving because these women were treating me like a human being and i was having a great time chatting with them. it got to the point that they were my only table, it was 20 minutes past kitchen close (the bar stays open), the pair were waiting for two more friends, and i really wanted to go home after such a spotty night. i explained to the two women that my shift was over, and that they can close out with me, or i can transfer them to the bar. they asked to cash out with me “since we are waitresses and get that you want your tip.” 

i then sat down next to one of the two women and asked her if she wanted to hear a wild story that just happened because, waitress to waitress, i needed to complain. the woman said she had a plethora of crazy stories and she’d love to hear more. so, i told her about the lady that just told me to pay for her personal drink out of my tips. i thanked her for letting me vent, we joked a little more, then i dropped their bill off and went to do the last of the closing side work. 

when i came back she handed me the clipboard and told me to keep the change. the “change” was $60. i immediately rushed back over and told her that i would only accept $5 and that $60 is waaaaaay too much, that they had been so kind and that was all i needed. she told me that i deserved it, they were perfectly content, and that she always makes sure that she has extra cash to do this for waitresses she likes. i apologized and told her that it looks like i complained so that she would give me a good tip, and that i was sorry if i put her in a bad situation. she told me that that was not the case, she felt no pressure to give me such a tip, and to take the money. 

so, i bought her and her friends bazooka bombs (since it was their night out) to thank them. 

i am so grateful for the kindness and friendliness of that table. they took my really shitty day and made it an even better one through their kindness. i will make sure that i pay their generosity forward so that i can maybe brighten up someone’s day like they did mine. to the two women in the booth: thank you, and i hope your lives are as awesome as you guys are.

206,german customer offered to do a foreign exchange program with me,"last night a guy came in and sat in my section all by himself. when i greeted him i noticed an accent that i was fairly sure was german but not 100% sure. i was intrigued because i just started learning german a few months ago in preparation for my vacation there in july.   


when he cashed out he paid with a lufthansa airlines branded credit card and this confirmed he was german (lufthansa is a german airline) so i asked him ""are you from germany?"" and he said yes and i told him about how i had began learning german a few months ago and how i was going to germany in july. we started talking about germany and he asked where i was going and why. i asked him why he was in the u.s (it was for work) and then he brought up his 18 year old daughter and how she really wanted to come to the u.s. i had told him how germany was the country i wanted to visit the most and he brought up the idea of doing an exchange between myself and his daughter. i would go to germany and live with his family for 3 weeks and his daughter would live with my family for 3 weeks. i'm 20 btw.  


i liked the idea, but i was skeptical. this guy who i had just met just offered to let me live with him in a foreign country... lol. he seemed nice and he showed me pictures of his daughters (he has 2) on his phone that were saved in his camera roll so it's not like he just pulled them off facebook real quick. he gave me his email address and told me to talk to my parents. when i got off work i went him home and i did some googling and i found his linkedin and he seems pretty legit. when i asked him where he lives he said a town in germany and his current employer according to his linkedin is based in that same town. however i can pretty much guarantee my parents would not be okay with it lol

207,old guy wants his fake points back onto his vip card..,"had an older trio come in to sit at one of my tables yesterday. there was a man probably in his late 60's -70's, a woman his age, and what seemed to be one of their mothers. we are in the middle of a rush at the restaurant, and we are packed. i work at an extremely popular restaurant in the area, so being extremely busy is not unusual by any means. 

i go over to the table with a big smile and introduce myself, and ask what they are going to drink. the man cuts off the two other ladies sitting at the table and says he would like one of our craft beers. i gladly say okay, and ask the ladies what they would like. he interrupts them again and says, ""hey, what happened to your $2 whisky shots?"". we sell $4 shots if you buy one of our beers, i inform the man that i don't think we ever sold shots of whisky for $2 but i can get him a shot for $4 as it says listed on the beer card. he informs me that i don't know what i'm saying and he used to get $2 whisky shots all the time, but he will take the $4 shot instead. okay. 

i go back over to the table after some time to find the man has finished his beer and ask if he'd like another, he says he would. the bartenders give us glasses to pour the beer into because some of our craft beers come in cans. i poured his first beer into a typical [pint](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/51aurs7dw%2bl._sx466_.jpg) glass. the second beer they gave me a [snifter](https://www.mibrewsupply.com/image/data/products/beer-glasses/brandy_snifter.jpg) glass and without hesitation i poured his beer, they are different shapes, but i poured the entirety of both beers into each glass. i bring the man over the second beer and he looks at me and says i am ripping him off. the second beer is clearly much smaller than the first! i assure the man that i poured both beers from the same size can, and that they are just different shapes. the man stares at me for a good 10 seconds before saying ""i honestly don't believe you"". i tell the man that i would be glad to pour it in a pint glass for him if he would like. he tells me no, and he will just drink his beer anyways. 

i decide to let the table finish their food out before going back over, the man asks me to tell him every single dessert item on the menu before deciding he's too full for dessert. i bring him his check and the man tells me he has a loyalty card. i run his loyalty card along with his check and circle how many points he has on his card. if you get to a certain amount of points on the card you get a gift certificate to the restaurant. the man asks me if he has a balance on his card. i go back over to the computer to check if he has any balance on his card and print out the report, the balance is 0. i go back over to the man and tell him that the balance is unfortunately 0 but if he earns this amount of points he will be able to get a gift certificate. he informs me that this is incorrect that he had a much higher balance. he asks me if the points expire and if his balance expires after some time. i tell him no (and i know this for a fact because i have some people come in that have had a balance for years on their card). the man tells me that he had a lot more points on his card and that he wants to use his gift card. i didn't really know what to say, as the report is the only way to see what your balance is on the card. i tell the man i will get a manager over here to help him find out where his points have gone. the man doesn't respond but stares at me for what felt like a solid minute (but was probably another 10 seconds) before looking at me directly in the eyes and telling me ""i don't have time for you."", embarrassed, i just walked away and didn't know what to say after that.

208,i never thought i would have the pleasure.,"so, i had these customers who usually came to the restaurant and would order a lot of drinks and food and then complain about every single thing and tip 1 dollar. one day they walked out on their tab when another server was serving them and she told me because she knew i hated them, well she isn’t there anymore but i am, ended up that these people came back today and i recognized them, i told them i couldn’t serve them because someone had walked out on their tab last time they were there, they asked to talk to a manager and i had the pleasure to call him, they ask him what they had to do to pay that tab so they could stay and my manager told them they couldn’t do anything and to leave because we weren’t going to serve them. i never felt so good. it was my day of glory.

210,i can't eat anything from your menu.,"on mobile and this just happened.

a couple just walks in and sits themselves down 20 minutes before opening.  then they decide they don't like that table so they move to another one and then another one.

she doesn't even look at the menu and proceeds to tell me that she can't eat anything on our menu because she is vegan so she is going to have to order what she wants and we will have to accommodate her.  so she says she wants toast with smashed avocado and some nuts on top.
i open the menu to the first page and point to exactly that, smashed avocado on toast with dukkah. 

she says she doesn't like my attitude and they leave. 

so yeah, i make an entitled vegan look like an idiot but my attitude is the problem.  i'm hoping for a review!",izl_g,tfys
211,customer makes me reconsider my thoughts about tipping,"one thing i've (26m) noticed about redditors since i started posting is that most redditors hate tipping culture. i've personally always loved it. i believe that i make more money than bartenders that get the majority of their money through standard hourly wage. just last weekend, i had a bunch of friends come in during the st. patty's day bar crawl. i used my entire comp tab on them, and my managers let me give them some deals that we normally reserve for late nights. they hooked me up and i ended up making 25% tips on a bar crawl that mostly consisted of 22-24 year olds. and i still sold 20% more than the other bar in my place. shit was good, and that's one of the reasons i love making tips. i also love being able to go to other bars and getting free drinks because bartenders know that i'll take care of them. 

but something happened yesterday that made me consider my views on our tipping culture in america.

i get seated with an 8 top (2 downstairs bartenders split a \~12 person table section in addition to each having our own bar and doing service bar for the other tables) and right away it's kinda weird. two people don't have their ids when i ask for them. one guy says that he has his police badge and that you can't be a police officer if you're under 21. i respond that i have no way of knowing if that's true and that my revealing that he's law enforcement he's definitely hurt his cause of getting served. also the table was supposed to be 12, ended up being 8, and one person ordered neither drinks or food. and they told me when they were halfway through their meal that they wanted separate checks. whatever, no problem, i wasn't busy and the stuff they ordered would be easy to split 5 ways (one guy was paying for three people, the rest separate).

eventually, i'm minding my bar and leaving them to chat. they seem done but haven't asked for their checks yet. the guy  (23) who picked up other peoples' tabs walks up to the bar. ""hey, can i get another drink. and also, do you have a blow hookup?""

i froze. for honesty's sake, i do a lot of cocaine. on the rare occasion that my bar/restaurant turns into a pure turn and burn establishment, i will do key bumps in the back to keep my energy up (i did during the st. patty's day bar crawl last week, once i got a second person behind my bar with me) and i've even had a friend come up to the office with me after i'd gotten off and rip out a bunch of lines with me and my manager and a couple other off-work employees.  so cocaine at work is not a subject that i'm unfamiliar with. but this guy was a complete stranger.

i handled the situation very poorly, i will admit. i'm a people pleaser and have a hard time telling people ""no"" in situations like this. instead of giving him a hard ""no"" or threatening to call the cops, i just sort of said ""uhhh, no?"" like i was thinking about it. so he responded ""well, do you know anyone who does?"" 

""uhhhh, maybe?"" 

""well, i'd really appreciate it.""

keep in mind, one guy at the table has already said he's a police officer. the guy looking for blow goes back to the table. i bring their checks. at this point, i know i fucked up bad by not giving the guy the hard ""no"" in the first place. he tells me that he needs a gram, that he's already done one and needs another for tonight. i say that i don't feel comfortable sharing any information with a complete stranger. even if one of his friends hadn't said that he was a cop. he says that the guy is just a cadet and works for him and doesn't know that he does it. i internally question how anyone could not know that this guy does blow because he is spun out of his mind right now. (kinda surprised that i didn't pick up on that at the beginning of the meal, but my manager said that he was in the bathroom and noticed someone standing in the locked bathroom stall, clearly not pissing, so he was probably doing bumps throughout the meal. he was in the bathroom like 3 separate times for a fairly long period of time.) 

the guy keeps continuing to imply that my tip will be based on if i can hook him up with coke. i tell him that if he goes to some different bars, he'll be able to find some, but that i'm not giving that information out. he keeps pestering me until i finally come back with their checks and tell him that i've already helped him as much as i can and he needs to stop. 

now the joke's on him because, as they had 8 people, i slapped an auto-gratuity on their check. i always verbalize auto-gratuity to my tables, but this guy happened to be in the bathroom when i first gave them the checks and told them about the gratuity (pure coincidence, not me trying to get one over on this dude). i guess his friends didn't tell him about the gratuity because he left $15 on $175 after the 20% autograt.

the whole experience definitely got me thinking about how relying on tips tempts us to do the wrong thing in so many cases just to make more money. i recognize that this is a one-off for me, and as a male, i won't have to give in to guests on a regular basis, but i recognize that girls that i work with put up with sexual harassment daily for better tips. and i never realized how strong the pressure to cave to the guest is until this experience. the job would be a lot better if i could  have just kicked that guy out without having to worry about losing money (was always planning on auto-grating, but was worried that he would refuse to pay his bill because i didn't hook him up). 

the other thing that sucked is that i remember laughing and joking with a couple girls at the table. everybody else seemed pretty cool and i'm pissed that the one dude ruined what could have been a fun table.",pepesilvia50,tfys
212,yet another absurd yelp review... apparently my restaurant treats us employees shamefully.,"apparently i can't post screenshots, so here's a yelp review that was posted recently. thought you guys would appreciate this.

&gt;summary: subpar food, shameful treatment of staff, and a complete farce. ready for details? the reason why people aren't seated even with six or more tables: they're trying to keep the staff from having too much to do. umm - anyone who has waited tables at any point will know how absurd it is. who wants to be standing around not making tips? this basically means they want to make sure they don't have to pay. 2) zero attempt on food presentation. boring.

you have a booth fit for four people that's plenty room! also it's the busiest day of the week, we might not _seem_ busy right now but that can change with the flip of a dime. i'm not going to make a table of 6+ people _wait_ for you to finish eating or to push tables together while i'm in a rush.

216,how do i go about addressing my concerns to the company?,"hey guys. this is going to be a long one but i ask that you bear with me since i am trying to determine whether there's a potential lawsuit here. 
i have a couple of concerns as to how the restaurant has changed up the way tips are distributed and as to how it will affect us. 
i have to admit that i am not a server. i am an expo. i have been for 1 1/2 and am actually starting my server training this wednesday for the very reason that the new system has got me fucked up

1) we just changed our system to aloha. so no more cash tips unless you're a bartender or server and only with people that tip cash, because we will no longer be doing cash tips. i am an expo. i received cash from each server and did not report these tips. 

2) now, our percentage increased from 1% to 1.25%, but it's only based on food sales instead of the whole check.  last night, a server told me that she served a vip party last night and whatever the sales were, the computer automatically distributed our tips as 36 cents!!! cents!!! this server literally never tipped less than $7 on a slow ass night. 

3) the 2nd longest working employee at the company, was saying that she had noticed that something suspicious was going on with the way that the reports were ran. she said that she runs two reports at the end of the night, one for her, one to turn in. she said that the night before, she saw that the report she ran had said that she claimed or reported cash when she did not have a cash check all night. she said, ""the entire night, i did not have a single cash check and there have been 2 nights already, that i am ""reporting"" cash. i am getting taxed on money that i did not receive."" the corporate employee replied that someone must have clocked her out for that to have happened because that could only have been done manually and she said, ""no i clocked myself out as i always have."" 

4) finally, the reason that all the servers and bartenders are considering looking for another job is because we are now paying for the boh pay raises. a couple of servers already mentioned waiting for the first paycheck to go and try sue the company's ass. now hear me out, no corporate suit or any manager has come out and said, ""yes you are doing that"" but now we are ""tipping"" cooks. 
our minimum wage went up to $12 this year. cooks starting is $13. supervisors are at $15-16. now everyone has speculated that because the company does not want to increase the cooks pay raise to balance out from the increased minimum wage, they decided that servers will now be tipping out the boh and they implemented that with the automatic aloha system. 
while a fellow expo made 36 fucking cents from a vip party, the cooks made 20 fucking dollars from the same server. 
to make it clear, i am not against the boh in any way. man, i am on the line with these guys. i love them to death because they have such great work ethic and are the best people i've come across. none of them asked for this. it's good for them, we know that, and i'm glad that they also see that it's wrong for servers having to pay for their living wage out their own pocket. 
 we have had 4 employees leave this year already 2 since the 18th, the day we got aloha. our gm said he is very stressed with all the changes going on but he has also addressed employee complaints as ""the system has changed and it's not going away"" 

i really appreciate it that you made it here. any and all advice would be greatly appreciated and passed along to my fellow coworkers that are all trying to get the old system back and getting cooks the pay they deserve. ",SandOnyx2,tfys

218,"old bitch micromanages party staff, bans butts, amasses soggy skewers, and squawks like a parrot.","i’m a chef, not a server, but this belongs here for sure. 

(sorry so long, guess i had a lot to get off my chest. tl;dr at bottom) 


i work for a big, fancy bar and we do a lot of private events. we have a very straight forward event questionnaire and catering menu for them to choose from. most parties are super easy bc the space is beautiful and we’ve got every liqour imaginable and our food is good, so people just pick what they want, set a time, and we take care of the rest. 


but there’s this event group that sends us parties sometimes (they’re like a middle man between the client and us, the venue) and every time we host one of their events it’s such a pain in the ass. they always want food off the menu, different lighting,different sound equipment, different silverware, insist on moving all the tables and furniture.  dumb shit like ice cream sundae stations, stilt walkers, “silent discos,” gimmicky things. i’m sure some people like that stuff, but in my experience people are completely happy with a little free food and a lot of free booze. 


so last night we’re hosting one of their parties, it’s for an personal injury law office. they’re doing their typical bull shit, complaining about lighting, bringing in their own high tops, asking us to move the piano to another floor. they’ve of course ordered food that is not normally on our catering menu. 


(let me just take a moment here to bitch about this. i as a chef put a lot of thought into my menus, the catering one is full of food that will be good and hold up after sitting for a while. there are things like shredded beef and chicken that hold in a hot well and there are things that do not. if there’s something in our regular dinner menu that’s your absolute favorite and it’s not on the catering menu, it’s bc i don’t want people to have gross food. risotto is not a buffet item! nachos get soggy! scallops? you want me to put this beautiful scallop in a chaffing dish?)


the old lady who runs the law firm, whom we had never actually met before bc we’d dealt exclusively with her minions for months, was there stressing out over every little fucking detail. we have booths that have curtains, she wanted me to remove them bc curtains that close are “asking for trouble” i told her they don’t close, they’re decoration.  she harrumphed and complained that the lanterns buzz. 


old bitch wanted all the apps passed. i told her polenta cakes with red sauce aren’t the best passed food, she didn’t care. also not the manchego tarts that ooze with cheese and saba. she’s also ordered the shrimp skewers but didn’t want garbage cans ruining the decor, so there are picks and napkins of red sauce piling up on every surface.  which is now my problem according to old bitch. my apron pockets are soon stuffed with grilled tomato and soggy skewers. 


instead of having a buffet set up like a normal person, she didn’t want any food set out until the middle of the party, so i’m like fighting through all these people with bowls of salads and burning hot half pans of short ribs. 


we have a back and front entrance to the floor they were on, they wanted to close the back door and make me and all the serving staff go all the way around the building and through the front so they didn’t walk through the crowd. ummm, the front end is by the bar, i know from my vast experience of doing this forever that people always crowd around the bar, but old bitch won’t listen. i ignore her as i’m filling the buffet bc i’m on a schedule and literally do not have the time to fight the crowd. she’s got a minion guarding the back door, but she seemed sufficiently terrified of me and just opened and closed it as i walked back and forth with trays.
it was supposed to be set at 7:00, so i started setting things out at 6:40. old bitch did not understand why i was setting out food early, “it’s not yet time!” because food does not magically appear as if we were in hogwarts ma’am.  she’s hovering around with a clipboard asking what’s in every single dish like she did not have three months beforehand to ask these questions. i set out the tuna (again, not a regular buffet item, as it’s raw fish, but she insisted, so i filled a wooden tray with ice and put the tuna on metal credit card trays to keep it cold as possible. i put it on the table at 6:52. “you need to take that back upstairs right now! it’s going to be warm!” (i can still hear her voice in my ear, like the gravelly old bark of some who’s been smoking for decades) i can’t even muster my fake customer service smile. i grab the trays off the ice, go back into the kitchen and leave them on the counter for 8 minutes and then take them back down to the ice in passive petty compliance.  she’s very disheartened to hear it’s marinated with soy, as there’s someone who’s celiac. again woman, had you told me before and not as i’m placing it on the table, i could’ve changed things!!!


now the very best, there are some black and white art prints of nude women in our bathroom on the party level. there’s bare butt, but no nipples or vagina. she asks us to take them down, we say we can’t ( they’re printed on metal and bolted in the wall) and this old twat stations a man outside of the bathroom to direct everyone to the bathroom upstairs. because the butt! no one must see the butt! 


i get all the food out and am helping upstairs because their party is almost over and we’re busy on the other level with regular service. they’re supposed to be out by 9:00 and then a dj needs to set up down there for a different event. at 7:45 we’re supposed to send out passed desserts and wrap up. at 7:40 one of the servers comes into the kitchen and tells me she needs a plain unseasoned chicken breast and a non starch veg for some lady at the party and also that the old bitch is complaining that the buffet is almost empty and the execs haven’t arrived. i throw a chicken in the oven and some brussels sprouts and go downstairs and old bitch is perched on a stair above the buffet table screaming out ingredients to people like a mad parrot. when she sees me she rushes over and says, “we need everything refilled! the executives are on their way.” i say, “ok i can get you some more of most of this stuff, but it will be an extra charge as i’ve already served everything you ordered and just so you know we have another event at 9:00.” “
what?!,” she says, “you’re going to have to tell them to come back later.” i plastered on my smile and said, i’m sure the time is on your contracts, why don’t i go get (gm) for you?” as i’m walking away she grabs my elbow and asks, “what about that special meal?? i asked for it 5 minutes ago!” i take a deep breath and remember to smile and say, “we don’t have unseasoned food on the menu, so i am cooking the chicken now, it’ll be about 10 minutes more for the chicken to cook.” her eyes bulge and i pull my arm from her grasp and escape. 
 

i plated up the desserts and got the hell out of there. my gm said everyone had a great time at  the party except old bitch, who patrolled the entire time, stressing everyone out. 


dear old bitch, next time just let the professionals do their jobs and enjoy your party! grab a cocktail, eat some food, and spend time with your guests. seriously, we got it. 


tl;dr old bitch comes to have a party, complains about everything, bosses around chef and serving staff, won’t let guests use the bathroom because nude artwork, doesn’t know chicken takes time to cook, is a general twat. ",ladydanger2020,tfys
219,“this is not mcdonald’s!“,"i just got a new job at a higher end restaurant. they have me on running shifts to train me up for the floor and get to know the food. 

yesterday was my second shift. for the most part i’m enjoying it, it’s a busy restaurant, that mostly does family style dishes. 

since it’s family style, expo decides when/what food should go on the table. there’s no timing on the server’s part. so if a customer orders beef, pork and a salad, and they all come up at the same time, we run all the dishes to the table at once. this specific dining experience is something the restaurant is known for. 

so a ticket prints out, three of their dishes come up on the line, expo tell me to run them. i get to the table, set them all down, when the woman says “um excuse me. this is not mcdonalds.” 

...what. “i’m sorry?” i say thinking i misheard her. 

she doubles down, gesturing wildly at all the food “this is not mcdonalds!!” 

“is something the matter?” i ask.

she then launches into a long tirade about how all of the dishes shouldn’t come out at once, how she’s been here before and that’s never happened (cue my internal eye roll), and how it’s “really not good, not good at all” and then asked me what i was “going to do about it” and even threw in an extra “this is not mcdonalds” as if i had forgotten.

considering i’ve worked at this job a total of 6 hours, was the newest staff member and just running food, i told her that i would grab a manager for her to speak to. 

this was apparently not good enough. she stopped me and said “no! you! what are you going to do about this? how are you going to fix my meal? how are you going to adjust my bill?” 

what i felt like saying was “look i’ve worked here for one full shift, i don’t even really know the menu yet, and i am the person with the absolute lowest amount of authority here. if you want your bill ‘adjusted’ i’m the wrong fucking person to be asking okay?” 

but instead i said “i can fix your meal by taking the food you don’t want now away and grabbing a manager.” 

specifically avoided running to that table for the rest of their meal. lol. ",shamelessadventure,tfys

this particular time it was a dude in a literal top gun military uniform with a napoleon complex.

he sat down at 9:45pm, i got him the menu. asked if i could get a drink started for him and politely informed him that the kitchen would be closing in 15 minutes at 10:00pm. he looked back at me like i just told him that he had to hug a porcupine.

without any eye contact he demanded a margarita, told me it was bullshit that i was going to close in 15 minutes. like i own the place and decide that. 

i go behind the bar make the margarita right away, put it in front of him, he clearly didn’t care that we were closing in 15 mins because when asking  if he wanted to order he stated “i will order when i’m ready, get me a water.” 

on my way back behind the bar i grab some dirty plates and check on my other tables, while passing by his table again i ask him how it’s going and if anything looks good. to which he responds, “how many fucking times do i have to ask you for a water to get a fucking water?” 

i’m in shock, and decide to just go get the water put it in front of him, and apologize for the minute long wait.  

this man, in all of his top gun glory tells me he just cannot stand to hear me talk anymore, slams his hand on the table and tells me to shut up and get out of his sight. 

again. i stand there shocked, and then he stands up two inches from my face, then says “fuck this. or i can just go, because i can’t deal with this bullshit.” 

the bar is silent. everyone is staring at us.

me: “yeah maybe you should fucking leave.”

tldr; family goes against resturant policy and goes batshit crazy when theyre charged extra and lies to the manager. the dad gets voilent and gets in the face of me, my coworker, and manager - all young females. 


this happened a few weeks ago on a saturday night. 
i will refer to myself as “d”, my coworker as “l”, and my manager as “m”. i will refer to the old man as “om”, his wife as “bitch”, and the two visitors as “sd1” and “sd2”. 


l and i had neighboring sections and it was a pretty busy night so we were helping eachother out. as any typical restaurant, we have our share of hard customers. i had a party of 6 who were on my nerve and she had a party of 9 who was on hers so we switched. 

at our restaurant, we do ayce “all you can eat” and al la carte and allow tables to decide what each individual wants to do. so if one person does ayce and one person doesnt, that’s perfectly okay as long as they dont share. only people who purchase ayce can participate in it - pretty self explanatory but it causes a lot of conflict. 

so the party of 9 expected sd1 and sd2 to arrive a little later, they were coming from san diego to eat. when they came in, they told l they would not be eating at all and only came to talk. after a few minutes she saw the sd1 and sd2 eating. l gave them their warning and they swore they werent as they had chopsticks in their hands. throughout the night sd1 and sd2 were seen eating off the ayce by all of our staff and was told by me and l to not eat multiple times or theyd be charged - everytime they swore not they werent eating. l asked if i could take over that table and i did so. i told them ( as they had chopsticks with food in their hand, full plates of sushi in front of them, and sd1 munching on a crunch roll ) that they were now being charged 2 ayce at 29.04/e for eating because they have violated our policy after being warned multiple times. sd1 says okay give me a diablo roll. and on they ate. 

l and i were about to leave at 9 because we hadnt taken a break that day and we had both been there since 1pm. right as we’re leaving om stomps to the front and yells at the manager.

om: are you the manager?! 

m: yes i am. 

om - clearly belligerent: your stupid servers charged my guests and i will not pay it. they told them over and over not to eat off of the ayce but it is not their fault because the food kept being pushed to that side of the table so they got confused so they shouldnt be charged! 

l: actually sir, i explained to your table multiple times not to eat off of the ayce and multiple servers have seen those people eating. they shouldnt have eaten in the first place since they told me they werent dining in. 

om: no youre a liar! they didnt eat! youre lying! 

m: okay sir, please have a seat while i settle this with my servers. 

we walk outside as their party is walking outside and our manager asks us what the issue is. we get interrupted by the crazy bitch mom. 

bitch: you stupid servers charged them and they werent eating! 

d: mam.. i saw them eating with my own eyes and i talked to them multiple times as well while they were eating off of the ayce. they had said they werent eating anything at all so they shouldnt have been eating period. it is our restaurant policy which was explained to you. 

l: ma’am we wouldnt charge you if we didnt have a reason too. we are only doing our jobs.

om and bitch angrily yell at us about how they didnt eat. 

om angrily screams at me and l and starts getting closer and closer while shoving his hands in ls face. the manager and i get in the middle while hes still screaming and i yell at him and say “you do not have any right to speak to her like that. you do not get to put your hands in her face or get close to us like that we are females. you have no right. i know this is a difficult situation but you have no right to get violent” 

bitch and her party of nine: i cant believe youre all getting worked up over $50. youre loosing customer over $50. this is terrible customer service! 

om: im not paying for shit you can charge me but im not paying for shit! 

m: sir, if you dont pay we will call the police. 

om: call them! 


to wrap it up, he and my manager argued some more outside but he ended up paying the bill. his party of nine bombarded me and l by yelling at us and accusing us of lying. they put up a bullshit yelp review too. ",mv5000,tfys
225,"""since you're a woman, does washing dishes come naturally to you?""","i recently found out about this subreddit and i have a small exchange i had with a customer i felt like sharing. it's not some extremely badass story, but some people did enjoy hearing about this when i told them, so i figured maybe some people on here would enjoy hearing it as well! (i'm not the best at english, sorry in advance if there's any unnecessary info, bad grammar, or awkward phrasings)

&amp;#x200b;

back in the summer, i worked part time at this small restaurant, which looking back at was extremely sketchy but i had a shitty fast-food job prior to that and i was desperate to get a new job to leave the old job. since the restaurant was really small (a bar and about 10 tables, maybe less?) my boss would only have one server work since there hardly ever the need for two servers at the same time, and it wasn't uncommon to have just one person or even no one in the restaurant. 

&amp;#x200b;

so there was just one guy sitting in the bar, chatting with my boss. since there wasn't any need for me to out in front and i didn't want to just sit around, i went to the back to load some dishes in the dishwasher. as i walked to the back i told my boss i was going to be washing dishes if he needed to get me. i grabbed the bin of dirty dishes, headed to the back, and started to clean up as usual. 

&amp;#x200b;

i looked up and saw the customer standing in the doorway. before i could ask him the usual ""how can i help you?"" this balding bag of sweat says, ""hey, since you're a woman, does washing dishes come naturally to you?"" now i've worked in the food industry since i was in high school so i would consider myself pretty used to weirdos and creeps to the point where i stopped giving shit about keeping the customer happy and i do whatever the fuck i want when i feel like someone is out of line. i looked at him and said ""i don't know. does being a chauvinistic ass come naturally to you since you're a man?"" 

&amp;#x200b;

he left and told my boss ""i think your server is mad at me"" so i told my boss what he said and he told the customer that what he said wasn't cool or funny (i get how someone can say that as a joke, but i didn't know this guy personally so it's kinda weird to say that to a stranger). for the rest of the time the customer was there he just kinda avoided me and tried to apologize. 

&amp;#x200b;

that was soft compared to the stuff i had dealt with previously from other customers, but i'm still happy with how i replied to him. my mom thought it was hilarious when i told her, so hopefully y'all liked it too!",spacemoney420,tfys
226,the worst first date i've ever witnessed,"this is a story about how i felt embarrassed for a guy on the worst first date i've ever witnessed.

this happened when i was bartending a few years ago, on a weeknight, around 11pm. this couple comes in and shows many signs of a first date. now, i've seen the girl in there a lot, always leaving with a different guy. she gets around the bar scene. 

they seem to be hitting it off. the girl goes to the restroom and the guy confides in me. he says, ""this girl is really cool and super pretty and i don't wanna fuck this up. i never drink and i'm feeling it."" i told him not to worry that i would have no problem serving him fake cocktails (soda water &amp; lime) from here on out. he went on to tell me that the reason he didn't drink is that he was going to school for law enforcement and any criminal record looks bad for his future. i had respect for the guy, he seems like an okay dude.

they hang out awhile, more patrons come in, and after some time she goes to the restroom again. this time, she is taking a little longer, maybe fifteen minutes. when she comes out, she starts talking to a couple guys sitting at the other end of the bar. it's mildly busy, so it takes me awhile to realise that the guy had been waiting around 45 minutes and his date never acknowledged him again. i thought it was a crummy way to ditch a date. i wondered if she just used him for a free meal and a ride to the bar where she could find a bigger catch.

this is the point in the story where you expect the secondhand embarrassment to happen. it is not.

the guy became very angry as he festered over his shitty situation. he said some racist comments to the guys that the girl ditched him for. he said it in the heat and passion of the situation, but it was way uncalled for. justifiably the offended patrons were not pleased and i had a fight to prevent. it only escalated and the tension between the two remained high. i tried to kick the first-date guy out, he was the greater antagonizer of the two parties. he refused to leave. i overheard a few patrons plotting to jump the guy in the alley at bar close. 

i always avoid calling the police if it's something i can handle myself, but i genuinely feared for the guy's safety.

so, i called the police. the only move i could see that provided safety for both parties. i was extremely embarresed for the guy when he explained to the police who he was and that he was in training to become a police officer. it was just, so visibly humiliating for him.

i never saw the first-date guy again. the girl started dating another dude. i didn't see her for a long time. then, out of nowhere, i saw her every night for two weeks, pulling the same old routine. i found out that her boyfriend was out of town at the time. i haven't seen her since.

i still can't decide who the bad guy is in this story. gettin' around girl, first-date guy, offended patrons, the police, or me.",armstaae,tfys
227,today i cried at work,"not even caused by a customer. but rather how much of a shit show my work is, and how much i hate it here. everything finally got to me. 

the fact that for the 6 months, we have been understaffed. what should ideally be a team of 7 people is regularly 2-3. we are on our 4th or 5th round of hiring an almost entirely new team. i'm the only one with open availibility, so you can imagine what kind of shit show my schedule is. 

the money isn't great because we're on a tip pool with an outrageous tip out. it's been happening at least once or twice a week i bust my ass and put $400-600 in the pool and am lucky to see half of it.

the owner docks a half hour every shift for a ""break"" that none of us are ever able to take. i'm either the only foh staff, or it too busy. at best i get 5 minutes to scarf down food behind the bar. 

that the few remaining staff dont seem to give a shit and cut corners. so i have to do all the extra work or will get blamed because i'm a main bartender and that's apparently my responsibility. 

i do a bunch of work for the owner (going through resumes, doing schedules, ordering, doing all the odds and ends to prep foh for service, etc.). he says he expects all his main bartenders to do this, and makes a big deal that he pays me an extra $2 an hour like he's the one doing me a favour. 

recently, within my string of my weekly clopens i had to work a double (13 hrs). over lunch we had a private party on our second floor for 30 people, while our main floor was open for walk ins. 

the only people in for the daytime was me, a host, and a cook to jump on as server for the main floor. 

the second floor bartender did a shit close the night before which totally screwed me over. the owner proceeds to lay blame on me for not doing a walkthrough at closing the night before. despite the fact i had my own bar and floor to close down, and the other bartender saying to my face everything was set to go for the party. i'm not his babysitter.

228,easily the worst customer i've ever dealt with,"so i used to work at a mcdonald's and i also live in a very hot part of australia (up to 45/47 with humidity) which is important. 

now every night after the dinner rush from about 7:30 the dessert rush would happen and last for about an hour or more. which meant that people wanted ice-cream and as you all know the ice-cream machine at maccas never works (with the extreme heat making it even worse). meaning i'd have to tell a lot of people that we don't have ice-cream at the moment (which as you can imagine upsets a fair amount of people who sometimes feel the need to take it out on the staff). 

now i always ask which ever manager is on at the time if we could put up a sign in the drive thru letting people know (mainly because i just didn't wanna tell up to 100 people the same thing over and over) but was told that the owner didn't want us putting up a sign. so this one couple comes through and the moment i tell the dude that we don't have ice-cream he goes from 0 to 200 in as little as 2 seconds, screaming carrying on and asks to speak to the manager. i say ok please drive on to the next window and i'll get the manager. 

now the manager on at the time was an awesome person, wouldn't hurt a fly, like seriously an awesome person. now when she gets there the dude starts going off his head at her (which i honestly can't believe an adult would flip this much shit over ice-cream for crying out loud, especially since it's a small town so you don't have to drive more than 15mins to get to maccas). he tells her that she's f**king incompetent, that she won't listen to him because she can't speak/understand english (she's asian and can very much speak/understand) and then just leaves. 

honestly i wish i had told him to f**k off but i was in such shock over how anyone could react that way over ice-cream of all things and i felt so bad for my manager after that and it very much hurt her. ",TheSecondComing97,tfys

not that hard right? nope. my dad taught me to always double check my orders and my receipts to make sure i have what i want and is calculated properly. i still maintain this habit with any transaction and with food ordering apps. here are some examples of morons using food ordering apps.

customer: hello my name is 'customer' and i've ordered my food through 'food ordering app' and i've been waiting for two hours for my delivery. this is unacceptable. i'm hungry and i have paid a premium (not true. no such thing) for this service!!!

customer: pickup!? no! i asked for delivery!!!

me: did you choose the delivery option on the app?

customer: yes! i wanted it delivered!

me: double check on your phone or computer or wherever you ordered it...

customer: (rustles around for a minute) oh...oh! wait. i wanted it delivered though! 

me: uh huh...you're gonna have to call the customer service of that app. (hangs up phone)

me: hello this is restaurant. how can i help you?

customer: yeah, hi. i got my ordered delivered just now and it's missing the chicken!

me: let me double check your name and order...no it doesn't have chicken on the order. 

customer: what!? i wanted chicken!

me: you didn't add it to your order when you sent this through the app.

me: did you check the option to add chicken to your order?

customer: there's an option?

me: yes...

me: hello, welcome to restaurant how can i help you?

customer: yeah, i made an order through app for a pickup under 'customer.' 

me: (looks through app and notices customer's order was schedule for 2 hours later) wow you're early. we weren't expecting you for another 2 hours.

customer: what? no! i wanted my food now! it was placed 10 minutes ago!

me: alright alright we can get it done now.

customer: it was confirmed! my friend set up the pick up order for me! this is so stupid. why the fuck did you guys not get started? why wasn't it ready before i came in?

me: it's because you scheduled it for 2 hours later that we didn't start the order before you got here! (turns the tablet to show his order) 

customer: (looks confused and calls his friend) dude! did you set it up for 3 pm!? i'm at the restaurant and they just showed me that it was schedule for 3 pm! well double check it...oh you're sorry. 

all the while the kitchen staff is finishing up the pickup order. it was never even that big or complicated it took 10 minutes at most to finish. 

customer: (still talking on his phone)...oh. my. god. this is so dumb. whatever i'm already here. 

me: (places pickup order on the counter) here you go. need anything else? maybe you wanna cuss us out some more?

customer: i...look i'm sorry about earlier i-

me: move please you're blocking my other customers... 


so there you go! food ordering apps have not made things easier for morons.

243,guest gets tired of waiting for his take out so steals a seamless order,"we do take out. it’s not as common anymore what with seamless but sometimes people still pick up food like on their way back from work or whatever. 

we do all take out orders (seamless or otherwise) on a first order, first served basis. so, even if a guest places a take out order and waits in the restaurant for it to be completed, they don’t get priority over someone who placed a seamless order before they came in. 

we had a guy (let’s call him rg for rude guest) call in a take out order and show up 5 minutes after placing the call asking if his food was ready. we told him it would be 25-30 minutes (like we told him on the phone when he placed the order.) 

he stands at the server station and is tapping his foot and giving us expectant looks. 

meanwhile, a seamless driver comes in, wearing his yellow reflective vest and bike helmet, so clearly a delivery driver. we say “for hannah?” driver confirms. we hand him two bags of food. rg goes crimson. “*hey!* i was here before that guy, he just walked in.” 

i explain the recipient of that order placed it before he arrived. he shoots back that the guy had only just walked in when he got food, but rather than try and explain seamless to him i say “he placed his order over the phone. like you did.” that shuts rg up. he just says “if i have to wait you might as well get me a beer.” fine. i smile and grab him one. 

unfortunately, professors from my college have started to frequent my restaurant, so i have to be extra careful about how i handle these situations. 

5 minutes later another seamless order is finished up and we put it on the counter. keep in mind, rg has been here for a total of 10 minutes and placed his order 15 minutes ago. “this is *egregious*, i have been here so long i’ve lost track of time. go back and check on my food, right now.” 

up to this point i’d been having a good day, so i was hoping i’d finish out the shift without any fights. i go in the back ask how long on his food, and, lucky for both of us, they were ahead and finishing it early. 

i went out and told him it would be out in two minutes. he said “finally. oh, and by the way, *i’m gluten free.*” (!?) he’s polished off his beer, by the way. but we don’t often have special dietary requests so i give him the benefit of the doubt and assume someone else in his party is gluten free or maybe it takes more than one beer to trigger his allergy. i don’t know much about gluten sensitivity. 

i ask if he communicated this request to the person who took his order. he said he figured it was assumed. rather than ask why in the world we would assume he was gluten free, i checked his order. 

of course, he ordered a quesadilla, flour tortilla tacos, and a tart dessert made with gluten. i go back and explain to him, and start to say we’ll remake it free of charge (manager policy on food sensitivities even if they didn’t say anything beforehand). he doesn’t let me get that far though. he is pounding his fist on the station ranting about how restaurants are required to provide gluten free options (not true) and that he’s calling the better business bureau. 

i repeat to him we are remaking it. he says “great. at this rate, maybe i’ll have it before the birth of my first grandchild.” 

i just ignore him at this point because there’s nothing more i could do but make things worse. a party of 8 comes in, booked by two regulars who made the reservation weeks ago for a birthday celebration, so i jump in to help my colleague get them settled. 

i was gone for three minutes, tops. i go back to the servers station and this guy is walking out with a bag of food. i’m impressed at the turnaround but figure the kitchen heard him giving us a hard time and took pity. 

two minutes after rg exits, a seamless driver walks in and says “picking up for otto..” we have no bags. i ask the kitchen. they say they just put that order out. i’m getting a funny feeling and ask when they finished the gluten free remake of the other order and in so many words they say “it’s been five minutes, we’re making it, get off my dick.” having to remake this guy’s order has killed their lead and they’re pissed. 

so, his order isn’t finished. he walked out with a seamless order he knew wasn’t his. and every item in the order contained gluten. and it was twice the price of the meal he’d pre-paid for. having to remake the seamless plus the party of 8 order puts the kitchen behind, and the place is madness for the final hour of my shift. 

rg is now banned and i hope he or someone in his party really did have a gluten sensitivity so he couldn’t eat a bite of it. 

*tl;dr: rude guest doesn’t understand how app delivery or gluten sensitivity works. berates us for not making his order gluten free, while drinking a beer. steals a seamless order when my back is turned and skips out on half the bill. gets banned.* ",tamiraisredditing,tfys
244,"“why did you ‘no-show’ my reservation?!” ..........because you never showed up, sir","this rarely ever happens, but when it does, oh boy. our restaurant has a rule where if an opentable reservation doesn’t show up or fails to contact us within fifteen minutes after their reservation, we are allowed to “no-show” them in the system, and they lose their opentable points. (for those unfamiliar with ot, it’s an app where you can make reservations with, and for each reservation you show up to, you get points. you can use these points to achieve gift cards, other dining experiences, etc. but each reservation is very little points, so it takes a really long time to achieve the gifts. if a reservation is a no-show, points get taken away). 

one time an ot reso never showed up or contacted us, so after 15 minutes, we no-showed them (as usual). not even two minutes later, the person with the reservation gets a notification from ot that they are a no-show. the guy calls us, and is screaming at me:

guy: why did you no-show my reservation?

me; sir, what was the name on the reservation?

g: “xyz”

me: *looks thru system and finds that they never showed up*

me: “i’m sorry sir, but according to the system, your party never showed up.”

g: “we did! i had the blah blah blah for dinner and my wife had the blah blah blah.”

me: “sir, we do have another location in case you meant to make the reservation over there.”

g: i know! we went to the “x” location, so why are we a no show?

me: i’m sorry sir, but you must show up to the  location where you made the reservation at, in order to receive the reservation points. 

g: this is ridiculous! you guys are the same restaurant 

me: we do have the same name sir, but we are two different physical locations.

g: *goes on and on about how this is ridiculous blah blah blah i need to give him his points back blah blah blah*

m: i’m sorry sir, but if you have any more questions you can contact opentable. i don’t have the access to give you your points back. have a good night.

do people *not know* how reservations work? opentable or not, you don’t make a reservation for one location, knowing you’re going to another, and expect them to know that you’re coming! ",kumquat_kutie,tfys
245,i want it extra spicy. but i am highly allergic to chillies - not that i told you.,"long time lurker, first time poster. on mobile, so sorry for any issues. 

i am a student who works part time at a family run asian fusion restaurant in a uk city. i've been working there for around 7 months now, and have only had wonderful experiences with customers.
that is, until a few weeks ago.

they (a man and a woman) come in on a weekday evening, and we aren't too busy. 

they look at the menu, and the woman flags me down and asks me if we do sushi, which we don't. 

we are advertised as a noodlebar, no sushi mentioned anywhere, but our menu is a bit confusing, so i shrug it off. 
red flag 1.

my coworker takes their order, and i notice they take a long time discussing what they want, asking for recommendations - and ultimately ignoring them. 
red flag 2.

their food gets served, and the woman's is an extra spicy version of one of our mild curries. she then asks for sriracha chilli sauce, which she coats her entire plate in. 

some time has passed, and i notice neither her nor the man have eaten much of their food.
they've both eaten about half, and she has placed a chilli on the side of her plate (the chefs add fresh chillies to make dishes extra spicy). 
red flag 3.

a few minutes later, she calls me over. i know something is wrong. 
she points her fork at the chilli on the side of her plate. 

w: ""i am highly allergic to chillies.""

i was confused.

me: ""i am so sorry, but i was under the impression you ordered your dish extra spicy.""

w: ""yes, i did, but i am highly allergic to chillies. i can not eat this."" 

at this moment i knew she was gunning for a free meal. 

you ask for your dish to be extra spicy and somehow forget to mention you are deathly allergic to chillies?

i am very non-confrontational, and never had an issue with a customer before, so wasn't sure what to do - i did the natural thing and passed on the responsibility to my coworker who took their order (and who was also more experienced than me).

i'd like to say we called her out on her bullshit, but we didn't. she got her meal comped. 

the only satisfying bit was when the women was giving my coworker her whole charade about being soooooo allergic to chilies, my coworker politely told her that the sriracha sauce she had  on the half of the meal that she had eaten was made with chillies and she may be want to be careful.

246,please control your children.,"it has been such a bad shift and i have nowhere to get this off my chest so here we go.

i work in a sushi restaurant and you can see the sushi chef working in public. however it's not a public show. we had a family sitting at a bigger table at the end of the restaurant with two children, one toddler and a boy about four years old. i understand that children are curious and loud, maybe they can be rude and inconsiderate at times, also messy and that's fine, but please, for the sake of everyone in this world, control your children to some extent. 

don't let them run around the restaurant and just stand right next sushi place, don't laugh it off when they scream at the waitress for more water and don't just say nothing when the kid throws a goddamn tantrum for me to handle. i'm not that kid's parent, don't spoil them by letting them be rude, loud, simply obnoxious and a pain to deal with for everyone. teach your child some manners.

249,tax season,"first year having to file as a server. well in order to clock out at my job we need to do so on time within maybe 5-10 minutes, which has rarely happened for me since starting, i usually go over about half an hour. so i’m not able to clock out and declare tips and must instead go on break, unless there’s a manager there which there always isn’t.

i live and work in los angeles. i’m required to report at least 8.70% of my sales as tips. when i’m not able to clock out i can’t report anything. i had to sign a paper after new years saying i would be taxed a higher % if my claims were under what was required (and over half of the time i wasn’t able to declare). 

not trying to cheat the irs but wtf. am i gonna be screwed when i file? i busted my butt over the last 8-9 months serving for my tips and hourly. (by busted my butt, i mean cutting other servers hours early everyday for the most part and slamming myself).

i hope they take enough outta my checks for it not to be to horrible, maybe i have to pay 1k and i won’t flip, but anything more seems like cali would be robbing me blind. sure wish it said “gift” and not “tip” on the cc receipt. wish i could not get taxed on the variable amount of cash someone seems i earned by serving them.

not for the current filing, but in the last month i’ve done over 1,000-1,200 in sales every shift except for one this month. yeah i’ve had to declare some high tip amounts close to 90-100$ every shit this month, not cool =/",sonkien,tfys

251,free what???,"so i work at an american restaurant, we had a 3 top sit down yesterday, they had just sat down when the host beelines towards me and says that they're ready to order. my whole section is full and i have other priorities but i figured since they were ready to order as soon as they sat down, they would be after something quick. 

i walk over with my tablet to their table and start my spiel ""welcome yada yada how are you all?"" they ignore my question and in broken english shove their phone in my face and ask if they can redeem the vouchers on their phone. i'm a bit taken aback but nonetheless, weirder shit has happened. i notice that they only had two left, so they had obviously been to our restaurant before. one is a two for one sunday (one of our many desserts) and the other is half price on one of our signature dishes. 

they ask me if they ""can use two"" and i say no you can't use both of them and that it's one per table. they then ask if they can get ""dessert for free"", and i said yes you can get two sundays and have one for free. they say okay and order a brownie and a sunday along with a side of fries and a drink. i assume they will order the sunday later as it clearly says in the voucher ""two for one sunday"" and i've explained it clearly. in total the order is around $30 for three people with the sunday being around $10. they receive their desserts i check back, nothing. they sit there talking for two hours and a half. keep in mind it's a busy working night. i say it's odd but i don't think anything of it after working a 10 hour shift, i just focus on the tables that need my service and looking forward to sleeping.

i sign off of my shift and they ask for the bill shortly after. as soon as they do they start cussing their head off and as i'm on my phone in the corner my manager appears next to me asking if i promised them free desserts.

immediately i say no and that's completely ridiculous considering they only ordered desserts?? like??? their bill would have been around $10 if i did promise that. and they start causing this big fuss that they can't believe they have to pay for the whole bill and im left gobsmacked. keep in mind, this is an expensive restaurant in a high class area! it's not as if it wasn't expected. we have a reputation of being expensive and we were in one of the most upper class areas in the state. they ended up leaving a bad review on our google page and i was left annoyed.

253,family owned restaurant where people have no concept of not touching workers.,"i am on mobile so i am sorry for formatting and any errors. if this is in the wrong place i’m sorry. this is from a ways back so i’m foggy on some details but my dad brought it up a week ago and i had to post it. so my parents owned a buffet style restaurant and i was a training lead/busser if needed. i was 18 when this happened and was not incredibly bold until i got a bit older and found my spine. anyway, i opened that morning and was running a section since one of our bussers was late due to family. no biggie. i can hold her section for a bit. 

i was walking through her section and i heard a loud whistle. and immediately decided nope, not looking and ignored it. i am not a dog. so i started along our front section and an older hispanic couple were sitting and they had a couple dirty plates so i stopped to get them, all smiles. 

the older man reached out and grabbed my hip. now i do not like being touched, a couple of regulars know this so i saw one watching. i stiffened and looked at this old man and he’s all smiles and begins to push and pull on my hip. 

“good baby hips!”  

his wife is nodding and smiling. i’m staring at him in horror and i do remember suddenly finding my inner snark. i glared down my nose at him in reply.   “i hate kids.”

i pulled away from him and fled. i was horrified and all i could think was that my dad was somewhere. he was in the far back in our accounting office. i made it to the dishwashers section, dropped my tray and the plates on it. in any restaurant the sound of breaking plates is normal. i stood there for a second in shock before i found my voice again

“dad!”

i apparently screamed and the dishwashers are now staring. my dad heard me of course (pretty the people up front could hear me as well) and he comes running into the dishwashers station. he says the way i screamed he was expecting blood. so he was a bit confused when i’m standing there, panting, going into panic. 

“what happened?”  

he grabbed hold of me and i am still panting like i ran a marathon and all i can do is start to cry. “he touched me!”  

i do recall him stiffening and staring at me. “what?”

“a customer grabbed hold of my hip!” i rushed out and started to have a panic attack. not a normal thing for me at the time. 

we had just gone through the training for harassment etc and i led the course...yeah i freaked out i admit it. 

so he took me to the office behind the big locked door and gave me my phone in case i needed to call my mom. told me he’d take care of it and asked me where it happened and i told him the booth section and it’s number. 

he told me this part recently. i had no idea what happened only that they were gone when i left (fled). he went out there and apparently looked furious enough that our kitchen manager “c”followed him just in case. he went to the table and they were staring at him. 

my dad is 6foot2 and at the time maybe 160. he was involved in the fire department as a volunteer and was studying and working out to prep for the fireman’s test. so he was and still is in pretty good shape. 

“did you touch my employee?

they stared at him and tried to feign that they don’t speak english. so c went to get one of the dishwashers who was fluent and the son of another of our employees and brought him up.  my dad repeats the question and coworker translates to spanish. they paled a little and tried to explain that they were complimenting my shape. 

“that was my daughter.”

they went white since my dad snarled this information in english to them. according to c my dad was beyond livid. he leaned over, so as not to tower over them, and spoke for the last time. 

“get out of my restaurant before i call the police. do not ever come back.”

they scrambled for the door and were gone. i knew dad got rid of them but i did not ask how.  they never returned. 

i was okay but had to leave. i am now over 30 so it’s been a bit. ",Oblivion2412,tfys
254,grandma's birthday- and they won't even bathe her,"so i work as a night shift server for a local diner. it was getting to the end of my shift, and i was finishing up my side work when i was told i had one last table.

i go out to look, and seated in the back corner, tucked in the very very back of the section, is a woman and two teen girls. i go over and say hi, they tell me they're waiting on their grandma and that it's her birthday. i acknowledge this, and then go back to the kitchen to finish up while i waited for the rest of the party. i'm just putting the trays away when one of the other waitresses (who we'll call adri) comes in and goes right to t, our manager.

adri: ""oh my god, what is that fucking smell? my table is complaining! it's horrible!"" 

t goes to the kitchen door, looks out, and then shrugs before swinging it open. immediately, the cool clean air of the kitchen smells like sour piss. he shuts the door and shakes his head before taking a deep breath and going out to talk to the table. i wipe my hands and go to check on my group. minding the smell, i take a deep breath and walk over.

me: ""hi, how is everyone? what can i get for you?"" 

 my air runs out once i finish talking, and i realized that not only is the smell definitely rancid piss, but that it's coming off the little old lady i'm currently standing right next to. it's so strong that i feel like my tongue is being coated in it, and i grit my teeth to keep from gagging. i take the order (thankfully all easy things that didn't require more than minimal engagement on my part) and all but dash for the kitchen. 

i get in the door, pull it shut, and proceed to nearly cough up a lung. my eyes are watering. t comes over to me. i look up at him and tell him that the stench is coming from the old lady at my table. 

t: ""what can i do? they're paying customers, i can't just kick them out.""

okay, so he won't help me. i've had bad customers before, and i summon my best survivalist-i-need-this-tip attitude. i put their order in, and curse all the gods ever as i grab the apps. i brace myself to walk back into the wall of stench, putting a plastic customer service smile on my face.  somehow it's worse, and i drop the apps and make sure everyone is okay in record time. my lungs are burning at this point. the grandma then realized she hadn't given me back her menu, and proceeded to hand it to me. i accept it and realize that the entire front is wet, and there's no sign of spilled water. i pull t aside and tell him that i haven't put my nose to the menu, but there wasn't any spilled water and that bleach would be a good idea. 

back in the kitchen, one of the other waitresses (for this purpose her name is rose), corners me. i'm scrubbing my arms in an attempt to keep from accidentally contaminating the rest of the food. 

rose: you should have refused service! i wouldn't have served them. and that's their grandmother? who let's their grandma smell like that? you can smell it all the way on the other side of the dining room."" 

she continues in this vein for a while, bolstered by the complaints of both the busboys and adri. 

the food comes up, and i grab three of the six plates, drop them and actually run back to the kitchen under the pretense of getting the rest. at this point my tongue and mouth just taste like piss, i'm angry and my head is spinning from me having to hold my breath. i scarf a couple of lettuce pieces to clean my tongue, grab the rest of the food, and do my best to act like my nose had been burned off. to the family, i'm all smiles and politeness. as soon as i get dismissed, i head for the back door. 

i get outside and spend a good ten minutes just coughing and trying to clear out my lungs before going back in to check on them. big mistake. i get to the table and almost vomit. somehow it hasn't sunk in just how potent the piss smell was until i had clean air circulating through my body. 

me: ""how are you guys doing? can i get you anything else?"" 

customer: ""do you have strawberry shortcake?""

me: ""no, but we have a strawberry crumb pie that's really good."" 

customer: ""her (the grandma's) favorite dessert is strawberry shortcake. are you sure you can't make it?"" 

me: ""no sir. but the crumb pie is really good."" 

customer: ""do that then. and we need you to sing to her since none of us can hold a tune, and pack it to go once you finish singing.""

with that, they return to the table, and i'm left staring in disbelief at the thought that i have to go over, fill my lungs and mouth once again with the gaseous form of a toilet, and sing. reminding myself that i really really need the tip, i psych myself up, grab the dessert, and sing out the most strained version of happy birthday ever to grace the diner.  i had brought out a to go box, and i hand it to the mom before asking if they want anything else. she says no, and i drop the check and go back to the kitchen, finally finally free. 

it turned out that the entire section where they had sat needed to be bleached and disinfected, and the menu had to be soaked page by page in a disinfectant solution. one of my worst tables ever, but rose was right. this was their grandmother's birthday, and she smelled so strongly of piss that the entire diner smelled it. some days, it's just wtf is wrong with a customer.

the party went smooth for the most part, albeit it started out a bit slow. the trouble started when it was time for them to pay. all separate checks and most of them payed in cash. i couldn't find a single checkbook in the whole restaurant so i gave them their receipts and immediate all 18 of them started throwing the receipts back at me with cash in hand. twas a grade a mess. 

i had to go back and forth multiple times to figure out who wanted change, and it took me forever to get them their change because i was trying to organize this giant stack of receipts and money. then the grown up with the kids started rushing me and even asked if i was new. it was literally a nightmare, my hands were shaking, i was so frazzled i was just trying to get them their change and get them out of here as fast as possible. i accidentally somehow got my own money mixed in with all of the cash, and it was a pain trying to figure out how much we each made from the party. pretty certain i donated some of my own money to the party money but i just didn't care at that point because i just wanted to go home. i've been serving here for nearly two years and i've never had a cluster fuck like this happen to me before.

i get a call from a woman and she asks me can she do the happy hour special in place of the large half off special. at the time, i wasn’t sure of the policy because i was new and didn’t want to give her the wrong information. by this point, i had gotten a phone call while i was taking care of guest a. i went to get the question answered when guest b called again, i wrongfully assumed it would be quick since it’s normally a fast process and answered the phone. 

bad idea. 

guest b had the most complicated order of 2019. he wanted me to make numerous orders on different checks and everything was modified. there were like 7 different orders. and naturally, it took me about 15-20 minutes. no one was at the host stand since it was around 10 so when guest a hung up, she kept calling back to back (about 20 times) and i literally couldn’t answer since guest b was constantly rattling off orders. i was looking around for other servers, a manager. anyone. but everyone was in the back since the restaurant itself was dead. no one else was around and i felt so bad. we are already short staffed and at this point, i was working damn near every night for a closing take out shift (midnight), would get home at 12:30 and had to get up for my teaching job at 6:30 am. (despite me only being part time) 

when i finally did pick up. guest a was furious. i was met with expletives. i tried explaining the situation. she told me she should have been the priority and her threatening to come up to my job. over a mini pizza that she couldn’t get half off. i apologized as much as i could and got the manager. i wasn’t in trouble since i was left alone. still i felt bad, now, i just do one guest at a time.

264,our parking lot ran into their car,"i've heard of crazy stories of people suing for ridiculous reasons. but the one that always stuck with me was the time this couple tried to get the restaurant to pay for the damage to their car. 

you see, they had lowered their sporty car. when they parked in our parking lot, the guy pulled in too far and the bumper went over the cement thing at the end. when they went to leave, the bumper got torn. which they claimed was our fault since it was our parking lot? we were busy so just gave them our card and said we'd talk about it later.

they came in a week later with a $3k body shop bill all smug like. manager asks ""where's the insurance claim?"". they said they didn't file one. manager wasn't born yesterday and said ""oh no no no, i'm not giving you anything unless you have an insurance claim that says i'm at fault."" couple left visibly upset, saying that they were gonna close us down but never returned. i really hope that they called their insurance company so that they got laughed at by the rep.

265,"sir, we are not open yet","so this happened this morning, a older gentleman was sitting in the parking lot when i arrived this morning for my shift. we open at 11am and i got there around 9:45-9:50am. being that i was by myself and no one would be here for another hour, i pulled to the side of the building so i can let myself in and the guy wouldn’t see me. that plan didn’t work for me. the older gentleman started to proceed to bang on the front door saying to let him in. i began to tell him that we are it open yet and that i’m there to set up everything. he started to yell and swear at me say that this restaurant was against him and that i looked like a customer and i’m just lying to him. which was bullshit, because i was in uniform. also, he felt that entitled to have special treatment for just demanding it.... anyways, after about 15 mins he calmed down and i went about with my business. but all the sudden, he’s banging on the door again yelling about how he’s going to call the police and that he knows people in this town. he called the police and they promptly escorted him off the property. apparently, he’s known by the police for doing the same shit to other businesses.

i was going to see if these people were finished with their meal when i was interrupted by this lady that was clearly a bit tipsy. she asked me where the ladys restroom is and i kindly tell her where to head. five minutes later she comes back and says ""i think it's sexist that the ladies bathroom is farther than the mens.""

267,“this is our favorite restauraunt!”,"working a slow rainy lunch shift, pretty slow day so far so i’m nursing a single table in the restaurant while the host and i are doing things to get ready for tonight.   i work in a wealthier part of the town at an “upscale” restaurant.  this older lady walks in and we both greet her and she tells us she’s waiting for a friend.  offer to get her sat but she decides she’s just going to wait for her friend.  we all make small talk for awhile and i excuse myself to check on my table.

i look back up at the host stand about ten minutes later and see she’s still talking with our host.  i make a joke about her friend being late and she tells me she must be running late and was talking about how this is their favorite restaurant!  we all keep talking for a little bit.  somehow she brings up her husband recently passing, talking about how she doesn’t go out very much anymore.  i excuse myself again and come back later and this ladies been here talking to the host and i for 45 minutes and her friend still hasn’t showed up.  this lady forgot her phone in the car and goes out to grab it.  she comes back and starts to call her friend who doesn’t pick up.  but her friend walks just a few seconds after the call.  

lady was cute but i was done talking with her and was happy to get her sat down with her friend.  our restaurant has a similar name to popular pizza place in the area... sorta.  both of them start with the same first 4 letters.  this ladies friend tells her that they’re at the wrong restaurant to meet up at lunch with each other (just the two of them) and they leave to the other restaurant.  i was so hurt it ended like this with that lady we shared almost an hour with that day.",BullsRunThisTown,tfys

269,fuck you and your bikes.,"so, last night when i was locking up i spotted two bikes locked up against a metal fence we have outside. my first thought was they were going to get stolen because of the following:

* we're located in a warehouse on a quiet street in a major european city.
* literally every venue on this street has a story about being robbed, most of us don't accept cash for this reason.
* the fence they'd locked their bikes to wasn't even bolted down.
* seriously, don't lock your bike anywhere you can't see it. bikes are temporary, you are always going to get robbed.

&amp;#x200b;

i come in this morning and lo &amp; behold, the bikes are gone, along with the fence. i don't think much of it as the bikes didn't appear to belong to staff or any customers so it really isn't my business.

&amp;#x200b;

a little later on, two very angry girls appear. i'm watching them panic outside for a bit before they come in and demand to know if i moved their bikes. i reply that i didn't and they ask to check our cctv. our door camera is inside so if something happens when the shutter is down, like it is overnight, it doesn't capture much.

&amp;#x200b;

on hearing this, they freak the fuck out and tell me that as they left the bikes on my property, i was responsible for their bikes. they also point at my bike which i leave next to the bar (inside, like next to the literal bar) and suggest i should give them that as compensation. when this fails to work, they tell me their lawyers will be in touch (who the fuck has a lawyer on retainer for a stolen bike) and that i should expect to pay for their bikes. these girls definitely weren't customers from last night, i think they just used our fence as we're the only venue nearby with anything you could lock on to.

&amp;#x200b;

i really hope they have a lifetime of stolen bikes and pick pocketing if they're this fucking stupid.

270,“not from you”,"so i work at this really popular restaurant where food and drinks are quite expensive, so i understand people wanting their food to be on point. today i had this guy that ordered a chicken sandwich without pickles or coleslaw and add bacon, no problem.. i ringed it in with the modifications. (the sandwich also comes with ranch and hot sauce) when i bring the food to the table, everybody is good except for this guys, who opens the sandwich and says in a rude tone: “where’s the ranch? where’s the buffalo sauce?” i couldn’t hear him very well cuz my restaurant is very loud so i asked him to repeat himself. “this is supposed to come with ranch and buffalo sauce” and i told him no, there’s no buffalo sauce on this sandwich, but i can get it for you.. no problem... so he said “yes, and when you get back, bring the menu” and i’m like okay. so i go back to the kitchen grab some ramekins with the buffalo sauce, ranch and the hot sauce; bring it to him with the menu. he literally reads the ingredients of the sandwich, while i’m pointing them out... and he goes “why is this not in my sandwich?” and i told him “ maybe they made a mistake in the kitchen but i brought it here for you, is there anything else that i can get for you?” and he goes “not from you, and i want to speak with your manager” and i was like okay that’s fine!!! 
at the end i told the manager i wasn’t comfortable taking care of the table so someone else finished it. don’t know if they got tipped. 

i just don’t understand why people have to be rude to their servers, first we are getting what you want and second: don’t you know we handle your food?? ",naimisalazar,tfys
271,you can't sue for setting yourself on fire.,"this is a short but good one. sorry for mobile format, you know the drill. 

i work at a venue, and we have for the last many years (literally since the 70s) had small, real candles on our tables for decoration. 

at a staff meeting this week, our manager told us that within the next couple of days, we have to switch all our petroleum candles to electric led ""fake"" ones. these are a bit easier to clean, but doesn't look nearly as good as real candles. 

you know why we really have to switch? 

more than once, someone has emailed my boss, telling how the candles are dangerous and irresponsible, as these customers have somehow managed to set their own hair on fire. along with the email they have sent a (very expensive) bill from their hairdressers along with a threat to sue if we do not pay. i repeat, more than once. 

personally, i think that if you are not old enough to not literally set yourself on fire when being near a candle, you are not old enough to drink in a bar.

272,masculine frailty and beer,"this happened again last night and it makes me so disappointed in humanity.
i’m bartending as usual, not a very busy night so i have a lot of time to chat up the bar folk coming and going. 

a man walks into bar and asks for a bottled wit beer. no problem. 
in my bar we serve our wits in a chalice. 

i set the glass down and the guy immediately says
“if my friends were here they’d never let me live this down if i drank out of this faggy glass.”

two things. 
1. his friends were not there. he was alone. 
2. if the abstract idea of your friends judgements can affect you decision making even in their absence, and your masculine ego is bruised because of this, i can’t really help you. 

are some men so frail that a beer glass can fracture their delicate masculine ideal?

as a card carrying, cher loving homosexual i’ll drink a beer out of a shoe if the beer is good and the shoe is chanel. 

anyway, i just left him with that and didn’t go back to him. i let him suffer and sip his beer from his dainty glass until he finally left. 

this can’t just be happening here. do you all coddle your frail male guests or do you just carry on? ",olddevilwind,tfys
273,"no tip, just jesus","i usually don't complain about this, because it happens. but today was especially infuriating. i work at a ""famous"" restaurant on the beach with moderately expensive food and drinks - that's all i can say. 

today, i had an 8 top come in who were especially picky. even though i had 5 other tables, i paid very close attention to them, made coversation, and even connected with one of the girls because we grew up 10 minutes away from each other. everything went swimmingly, in my own opinion. they didn't even want to split the bill, which was great. they seemed like perfectly pleasant people. they stayed for 2 hours.

all said and done, the total on the bill came out to 400$. i was (obviously) pumped because tips on tables this size at this restaurant are usually pretty good. i see them out, thank them for coming in, and (after they leave) run to the table to grab my receipt.

and what do i find? a brochure for a local church. in the tip line, it says ""jesus saves. have a blessed day.""

so basically, my sentiments are ""fuck off and die 😉""

end rant.

edit: grammar is hard

edit edit: the managers don't like us to put on grats unless the table is awful - and i usually don't if they're nice. so, fuck me. never doing that again.

276,"don’t touch your server, thanks","i’m on mobile, yada yada yada. 

i wait tables and bartend at a sports bar on a college campus. we mainly cater to frat boys and townie men in their 50’s and 60’s. i’m a young and conventionally cute blonde, so i’m fairly used to being hit on at work. no biggie if my customers want to try to flirt, i’m nice to them but i don’t return any advances. 

last weekend, i was the only server on the floor and we had one bartender. we were about an hour to close, i had three tables and there were about 10 guests at the bar. as i’m walking around the corner from the host stand to take an order at one of my tables, i bump into a frat boy and his dad headed back to the bar from the bathroom. they were both hammered, i apologize for not paying attention to where i’m walking and the son and i laugh it off. 

however the dad keeps laughing and is following me to my table, all while grabbing at my waist and trying to grab my arms. i keep trying to walk away from him, brushing him off and trying to keep a friendly demeanor so i don’t piss him off. i get to my table to take their order and he’s still following me. this time, he grabs my boob. just full on squeezed my left tit. ’m right in front of my table and they’re laughing at the interaction. so now i’m humiliated, i’ve just been felt up by someone my dad’s age, and i’ve got a bunch of bros laughing at me. the guy heads back to the bar, i take the order and go tell my manager. 

and the manager does nothing. doesn’t say a word to the customer, doesn’t cut him off. just let’s it happen. i love my restaurant, the customers are usually kind and respectful, and while i’ve had some inappropriate comments made towards me, i’ve never been violated like that and i’ve never had a manager act like that’s not an issue. i’m disappointed in myself for not retaliating against the dude or doing more to protect myself, but i’m more disappointed in how my boss handled it.

277,i never tip anyone but you should be friendlier.,"as read a lot: english is not my first language, i’m on my phone and this is my first post ever. hope this is the correct sub, if not please correct me :)

some backstory:
i am a fitness instructor and work at a health center. we also have a couple badminton courts, indoor tennis fields a well as an indoor soccer field. once a week i work late shift (until 11pm) and we also have a small area where people can order some beverages after they’re done with their workout. we offer beer, wine, coke, etc. 

here comes this elderly man (em). his wife is one of the sweetest gym members we have and she is super nice. he’s always a little grumpy though, but wants to talk a lot. however he barely has any teeth left so it’s hard to understand him. he visits us couple times a week, but only to get some beer or wine, he’d never do any sort of exercise. usually he always orders the same thing, sometimes he has some wishes (like wanting his beer room temperature and not cold) which is super okay with me. but as often as he visits us, he has never tipped any of our waiters. he’ll stand and wait for his penny as a change, i never said anything, but seriously no one really liked him.

today i just finished one of gym classes and my co worker left as her shift finished. i talked to a couple people from my class. one lady decided she wanted to start a membership so i set everything up for her and gave her the paperwork to fill out. then there was a couple waiting to pay for their badminton court as well as a another lady wanting to get an appointment with our therapist. besides all of that there were still some men waiting to get some beer, so this a little stress (it’s been worse). i’m trying to help everyone and i’m finally finished.
then em walks up to me to pay. since i just took over the shift, i looked a list my co worker made.

me: hello.
em: i wanna pay.
me: sure (looking at the list) you had two glasses of red wine? (smiled)
em: no, three.
me: oh alright. (little chuckle)

i can’t really look people in the eyes when i’m talking to them so i just look a little beneath their chin. he laid the money down on the counter and turned to leave. i took the money, went to our cash register, booked everything and put his money into the register. em then approached me again.

em: you should be friendlier!

he looked at me for a couple seconds with that super cold stare and then left. i stood there speechless.

278,the naked man in the bar,"many years ago when i was young(18 in the 80's) i worked as a barmaid in a local hotel, basically a bar that served meals and had a few letting rooms but held the grandiose title of hotel.

one boxing day i started my shift at 7, chatted with the barman i was taking over from who said it had dead since 3, there were two women sitting at a table just chatting and a middle aged man looking at the jukebox, i know him by sight but he has never been a regular.  so with it being quiet i thought i would get a head start for new years eve by bringing the spare glasses from the storage room in the hall to the prep area next to the bar and set the spare glass racks up, i had been busy for about 10 mins went to check in with the ladies they were sitting there with their mouths open staring at the man who was now wearing nothing but a pair of socks dancing to the jukebox.  so i ran upstairs and hammered on my bosses door telling them there was a naked man dancing down in the bar, she said  "" oh that's just so and so just tell him to put his clothes back on and to go home."" and she shut the door, so i went back to the bar took a deep breath and looked him straight in the eye told him to put his clothes on and leave, he did with no fuss and even said goodnight to the women in the bar. i was in shock, when i asked my boss about it later she said he did it every year and was no bother as he never did it in a full bar. wtf.",Bitchinthecorner,tfys
279,who steals from a restaurant?,"human filth is who.

i can’t believe how awful some people can be. i can deal with angry customers, crazy emails, homeless fights; but people stealing shit really gets to me. i manage a small counter top restaurant in a major metropolitan city that is continually very, very busy. i’m very proud of the work i’ve done and 99% of my interactions with guests are incredibly positive. i can count on my hand how many times i’ve really had a deranged guest and the most annoying thing people do is stay long after we close (another annoyance but it’s part of the job).

but for some reason, i’ve been running into weird thieves at my work. we do live in a major city with a big homeless population but i’m fairly certain this is just regular people as we keep an eye out for anyone looking like they are going to steal (and they usually go for purses, bags, etc). now the thieves aren’t stealing food or plates but continually steal ketchup bottles and for whatever reason the air fresheners in our bathrooms. like who does that? i just can’t fathom being a human being who goes into a public place and decides “i need a new air freshener for my house”. i literally bought some two days ago and my co-manager texted me this morning that one was stolen.

280,“you should’ve been more seductive about the dessert”,"this happened to me today.  i’ve been doing this for almost 10 years now, not much phases me-and this doesn’t really phase me but it was annoying and a good laugh for other servers.  i work at a local, family owned taphouse with pretty killer food.  we get lots of beer people, young and cool families, and military based on where we are but our food does stand alone apart from the beer aspect so we do get elderly and older folks.  anyway i was one of 2 servers today and we had a large party upstairs so i decided to let the other server handle that alone and i’d handle the dining room rather than split the party and both of us be serving on 2 floors.  we had a big rush and i ended up with 10 tables at this point in time (i’d say average servers here can have 3-4, i would be most comfortable with 6-7 but i can hack it and get through so nbd).  anyway i had deuces and 4 tops of lunch breakers sitting left and right.  everyone was on a weird iced tea kick today so i was slinging refills.  i did a great job keeping drinks filled, getting orders taken and correctly rang and throwing in as much friendly, funny interaction as possible.  
this one older couple had finished eating, asked for a box and i’m thinking “okay great another one to finish up and stop worrying about”.  they asked for dessert and asked for some details about 2 choices.  i gave them a synopsis, and when i delivered the bread pudding and lemon cake the old woman proceeded to lecture me about how i could’ve described the desserts more “seductively”.  ok, first of all you were convinced to order 2 of them based off my initial description?  secondly, bitch i have 10 tables and i’m sorry i don’t have time to sexualize your dessert choices.  even my boss thought it was funny but i was a little shocked because people are usually extremely impressed by my professionalism and i haven’t been told “how i should be serving” in years.  
example of how i “should’ve” described the s’mores bread pudding: “we are serving a bun (100% not just a bun btw) covered in a creamy icing, filled with graham cracker, marshmallow and chocolate flavors and drizzled with luscious chocolate and vanilla, accompanied by a decadent scoop of ice cream and powdered sugar”.  i told her it was s’mores ala mode.  guess i have to be more sexy /s ",bruins68,tfys
281,customers acting terribly to get free meal,"first things i want to mention: i work in a hotel-restaurant, and i'm not a server, just a hostess.  
i've been watching this subreddit for a while and figured i'd post my first nightmare-customer(s) encounter. once upon a time, during a particularly busy lunch shift, i seated a table of 4; 2 adults and 2 small kids (a little girl in a highchair and a little boy). now, i understand when kids are at a certain young age, most are not aware of how to behave in a dining establishment. however, as i'm watching the dining room and staff, i observed the little girl grab any and every thing that wasn't nailed to that table and toss it into the floor (some items were even handed to her by the parents!!). again, i'm not really upset at the kid, just the parents for allowing (and enabling) her behavior. because all the servers and bussers were busy, i decided to get a broom and dustpan to sweep up the sugar packets and such the child had thrown into the floor, nbd. the mother sees me and says, ""oh i'm so sorry about that! here...,"" she proceeds to grab her large purse, pulls out a wad of trash (like days worth of receipts, gum wrappers, you name it), and tosses the trash into the floor, looks at me with a polite face and says, ""since you're sweeping anyway, right?"" ... i had to literally bite my tongue and kept my eyes glued to the floor cause i knew if i looked up at her, i would've lost my shit.  
and of course, it only gets better from here; as time goes by, i suppose their food was taking too long, and as soon as i peeped around a corner and made eye contact with this woman, she shouted at me, ""will you please come here a minute?!"" i knew instantly this was going to be bad, but i still maintained my composure as i approached and kindly asked, ""yes ma'm, is there something i can help you with?"" she proceeds to rant (almost yelling) about how awful our staff &amp; service has been, that it was ridiculous how their food's taking too long (mind you, there are several tables in our dining room that were here before them, one of them being a 12-15 top). one huge kicker in her rant was that she stated, ""my children have been so good, don't they at least deserve some rolls on the table?!"" and come to find out later, when the server had asked earlier if they wanted bread-service, this lady had said, ""no, my kids will just throw them into floor.""  she even poked an angry-shovey finger on my actual name tag and said, ""what's your name?! \[*my name*\]?! you know what \[*my name*\], i think i'll report you and everyone else here to your corporate office for this god awful service!!"" the only response i could muster was, ""will you excuse me please, ma'm?"" i proceeded to briskly walk into the kitchen, find my supervisor at the time, and told her this table needed to speak with her. she started to ask if it could wait, until i told her, ""let me re-phrase my request. either ***you*** go out and talk to them, or you can send me back out and someone will be leaving on an ambulance stretcher and spoiler alert: it won't be me.""  
in the end, not only did the lady get their meal for free, but after numerous complaints to the front desk, they also got their room for free too :/ so yay for rewarding bad customers and their bad behavior! /sarcasm

282,customer assaulted me for refusing to serve him anymore.,"so i recently found this subreddit again and it got me thinking about my days as a bartender. 

i was a bartender at the most popular bar in our town. you name it, i've seen it happen. 

we have a policy to not serve drunk customers. this sounds a little weird as most people go to a bar to get drunk, but the point being is so that you don't serve customers to the point they get black-out drunk. edit: thanks for reminding me this is illegal guys. 

now there were about 6 gents drinking at the end of the bar and they were starting to get quite rowdy. one of them signaled me to come down to serve them, as he's trying to order a new round i can see him visibly swaying and slurring. he's past the point of me serving him or his friends any more drinks. 

i politely let them know i'm going to have to refuse them as i believe they've already had enough, and it's company policy to stop serving customers at this point. 

he retorts that i am a stupid cunt and don't know what i'm talking about and to get him his fucking pint. 

i let him know there's no need to speak like that and now i definitely won't be serving them anymore drinks. i tell them to finish their drinks and leave. 

the guy i had refused throws the rest of his pint over me and then throws his empty pint glass at my head.  thankfully, him being so drunk his shot went wide and smashed against one of the fridges behind me. 

i let them know that they should leave as i will now be calling the police. 

they promptly left and i phoned the police, they came to take my statement and ask if i wanted to press charges. i told them i'd had such a long day as is i'd rather them just be put on pub watch so i never have to see them again. 

the police were very nice and promised they would do just that.

i work in a coffee shop, we always have a large morning rush. i'm making drinks, a woman walks up and demands where her drink is. she tells me the drink, i look at our drink line up, and i tell her it's coming up after i finish the next two drinks that are ahead of hers (this will take me all of about 3 minutes to do). she gets really angry, and says ""are you kidding me? i need to not be late for work. what the hell. i'm coming back this afternoon for it"". i tell her we can't do that as the have been issues in the past. she stomps away and stares me down. 
i decide to be nice and make it (mostly to get her out of here). i call her drink next,  she grabs it and gives me the nastiest look before turning away. i say ""you're welcome, have a great day!"", to which she turns around and hisses ""i said thanks when i picked up the f*cking drink"" and storms out.

come tax season, i’m doing my tax return and i end up owing money for the first time ever, and it was over $300 that i had to give back.

288,guy watched nasty things on his phone in a restaurant .,"hello , im new on reddit and this is my first story ever 🙂 also english is not my first language . 

so a bit of a backstory : two years ago i worked in a 5 star hotel as a waitress . most of the time i worked in the main restaurant which was pretty big and there was 3 section : 1. the main 2. glass room (only adults) 3. the pool area .  

to the story : so like i sad i worked in a hotel and that day i worked in the pool area  which was very busy . there was a family the hostess took them to their table and i went to take the drink orders nothing weird yet than the wife and two kid went to get food from the buffe and the guy stayed at the table , than the hostess had another family and when she finished she walked to me and said : 

h : that  guy over there is watching porn on his phone 
me: are you joking right ? 
h : no , im not , if you not believe it than go and you will see 

i wanted to take a look if he is really doing that but i had things to do so i stayed in my place and made my job  than my colleague went to take some plates and when he came back he was laughing and said : 

c: this f@cking bastard watching porn on his phone 
me: no way he is doing that s said the same are you guys joking whit me right ? 
c: no go to clean the other table next to them and you going to see it 

so i went to clean the table and when i looked aside i saw that guy had his phone on his lap and watched f@cking sick porn  , i was shocked  
 
 i went back and i stayed next to my c he was laughing because he could not belive that it was true i asked him if we should do something because there was a lot of children around them and its disgusting . but he said that what we can do about it ? how you going to tell this to the manager ?  so i tried to not think about it when i had to clean them and after they left .and the next day i have not seen them because i had to work in another station .

291,“i’ll be right back with your drinks”,"two stories from your local restaurant! neither were me, both stories are from my coworkers. 

-drinks- 

i work at a small local restaurant that mostly serves regulars, and many have been coming to our restaurant since we opened back in the 80’s.  that being said, everyone who works there is either in college or college aged, including the managers. i work as a host since i’m under 21, and on any given night at close we have a manager, a host, and a server. 

it was a really slow sunday night, and we probably had one or two tables in the whole place since we were near closing time. a couple of older gentleman and their wives were sat in one of those, and i told my coworker (who we’ll call x) to go get their drink orders since i had just shown them to their table.  i see x walk over to the table and get their drinks, and i see the group’s faces look absolutely shocked, at which point x quickly turns away red faced and runs towards the back as subtly as possible. 

after probably five minutes, i hear my manager absolutely cackling in the back of the restaurant. i go back to see what the commotion is about- and apparently when x had gone to get their drink orders the conversation went like this:

(table finishes placing their drink orders)

x: “i’ll come in your drinks”

(he meant to say “i’ll come right back with your drinks,” but it was the end of a long shift and we were all tired. he didn’t correct himself afterwards, just ran off and asked me to finish serving the table.)

still makes me laugh whenever i think about the look on my manager’s face when x told him why there might be a complaint. 

-order in-

so when a female server has to clean the men’s bathroom or vice versa, they have to knock and say “all clear?” before entering to make sure they don’t scare the daylights out of someone.  also, whenever we place an order into the kitchen we have to say “order in” so they know there’s a ticket on the counter for them. there’s the backstory!

so my female coworker, y, went to clean the men’s bathroom one night and instead of saying “all clear?” she asked “order in?”, and unfortunately a man was in the bathroom and proceeded to tell me the story when he came to pay for his dinner at the counter. she was mortified and to this day whenever one of us has to run to the restroom during a shift where we work together we just say “order in” and then go about our ‘business.’

292,working women....,"...is what they call themselves.  but it's really just a group of huns who have never worked a day in their lives applauding other huns on their ability to sell mlm cosmetics.  this wouldn't bother me, but they treat their servers, hard working people who are nine times out of ten women, like shit.  there's usually 20-30 of them and they have a standing reservation every other friday.  they always get two servers.  this would be sufficient with any other group.  the problem is that they are constantly moving around and changing seats and no one wants to claim their food.  okay, so mostly they are annoying, but tolerable, but there's always at least one.  you know the one, that entitled bitch who starts complaining when her food isn't out in five minutes, even though she's in a group of thirty people, not to mention the other guests in the restaurant.  she's the only person in the world and she wants her food... now!  in a group like this the mentality spreads.  any time a server comes in and sees they've got the group they let out a groan.  many have threatened quitting if they have to do it again.  it's just not worth the hassle for the meager tips they leave.

294,parents forgets to inform us about son’s buckwheat allergy in a soba (buckwheat noodle) restaurant.,"this happened in august 2018. 

i worked as a waitress at a busy japanese soba restaurant. for those of you who don’t know what soba is, they’re noodles made from buckwheat flour. but i’ve also been a volunteer emt for a couple years. 

so it’s the dead hour between lunch and dinner rush, so there are only a couple of tables of two at the restaurant. i’m moving around the restaurant sweeping the floor (lots of kids earlier and sticky noodles) while my two other coworkers are waiting at the side in case more customers come in. in comes in a family of 6- a set of grandparents, a set of parents, and two boys. my coworker sits them down near the back. i’m sweeping rather near the table so i can hear the conversation as my coworker takes their order. the adults order soba and the boys order udon (which is made of wheat flour). they don’t list any allergies or food restrictions. they get their food and start eating. 

the food is ready so all the servers go to the kitchen to bring it out. afterwards, i use the bathroom. while i’m washing my hands, i hear a crash and my coworker yelling for me. now we never yell in the restaurant so i came out quickly. the older son had collapsed on the floor and the mother is freaking out, trying to read an epi-pen. the father had run out the door to the ambulance corp (which is a one minute walk so it’d be faster than a phone call tbh)

i immediately ask the mother for the epi-pen. she wasn’t that great at english so she was struggling to read and understand how to use it. i take the epi-pen and inject it- the kid unconscious so not even flinching. then i manually keep his airway open. my manager starts speaking to her in japanese trying to calm her down- she’s both angry at us and horrified at herself. the ambulance arrived quickly. in a minute or two. 

the poor women had completely forgotten to mention the allergy and the udon noodles had been cross-contaminated by the soba noodles. my manager insisted that they not worry about the bill, just focus on the boy. the grandfather takes the other son and leaves, while the mother and father goes on the ambulance with the son and the emts.  

but the grandmother refuses to leave. she’s angry and scared and directed those emotions towards the staff. ironically, not to the server who took the order, but to me- who brought out the udon to the grandchild. she’s threatening to sue me for poisoning the child since udon shouldn’t have buckwheat- i should’ve told her the udon had buckwheat! (it doesn’t but our restaurant’s main dish is soba noodles) 
we eventually had to call the police to make her leave...

the restaurant got a letter from a lawyer, but they told me they had it all handled. i did end up crying because of the guilt a couple of days later. the angry father had called to tell us that the boy still hadn’t woken up and that i killed his son (i picked up the phone and have a distinctly high voice.) we found out from a regular a week later that the kid had woken up and was doing okay. they drop the lawsuit. 

it’s half a year later but i’m still pissed about this shit. i know it was a genuine mistake on their part- but in the end, it was *their* mistake. they shouldn’t have blamed the restaurant. like why would you go to a restaurant that specializes in buckwheat when your kid is allergic!!! and why the hell would you not go over how to use an epi-pen after knowing your kid can get anaphylaxis? some parents are utterly clueless.

295,"just found out that tups are being stolen at my place, need legal and ethical advice","**edit:   tips**
i feel like the biggest idiot to ever walk the earth for not proofreading the title.  maybe i deserve to have all my tups stolen.    
—

i work in san francisco, california.     relatively good worker protection laws but i’m not a lawyer.  

backstory, we’re in a pooled house that by design requires quite a bit of support staff.  we also add a 20% gratuity “service charge” in parties of five or more.    

last monday i made about $450 in tips and my coworker actually beat me at $650.   (the third server wasn’t so great, he was in the $200 range).   

it was a crazy monday, which is rare, and we had two bartenders on and three bussers and two food runners and a host.   so obviously the tip out will reflect that.  

but my take home was only about $120.     

this got me confused and looking into things and all of a sudden i found out that my place is taking a % of the auto-gratuity on large parties.   the “service charge” isn’t being given to employees as tip.  

we were all lead to believe it was a tip.   we communicate to customers that it is a tip.   i personally highlight it or circle it on the receipt every time to make sure they know it’s there and don’t get surprised.     it’s also written in small print on every menu.    

but apparently &gt; half of it is being diverted to the house.    

i can’t afford to just storm off and quit.   also, i like this place — flawed as it is.  i see structural changes we could make to become a better restaurant.   

i just don’t k ow what to do.   there is one manager i trust to answer my questions honestly.     but she isn’t the gm.   i also think i could approach the owner, he would get a drink with me.  but i would need to walk into that meeting prepared to be fired or quit.   

i guess the point of this post is, wtf restaurants!    server lives are hard enough.    why you gotta do shady shit just to fuck with us too?


2nd edit:   i read all the stuff i signed when i became an employee.  i read it carefully.   i’m type-a like that.    i never signed anything related to this kind of thing.     ",BEETLEJUICEME,tfys
296,the weirdest to-go i’ve ever experienced,"first time poster, on mobile sorry for format, blah blah

so i was a hostess at a fairly popular restaurant in my area and was in charge of taking and packing to-go orders. when a customer called in an order they didn’t pay until they came to pick up the order. i got a to-go order for a lady, that we’ll call amy, who was arriving in a white honda. 

about 15 minutes pass and i see a car pull up in the to-go spot. it wasn’t a white honda but i thought “maybe they had to take a different car” cause idk shit happens. so i go up to their window and i ask if they are picking up for amy. this was also a dude, so not the person who placed the order, but again i thought maybe her husband came to pick it up. the guy says yes, i tell him his total, and instead of handing me a card, he took the book from me. he looks at the receipts, asks me for a pen, and then starts staring at the receipts for like a minute or so. i don’t say anything cause i’m confused but eventually he says “i’m not sure where i sign on here.” i let him know that the meal hasn’t been paid for so you can’t sign yet. he seems super confused but hands me a credit card. 

i walk back to the register to cash him out. i wasn’t able to bring it back out to him right away because i got several phone calls. i grab his check and the food and start walking to go back outside until i realize that he’s not in the parking spot anymore. my manager was nearby so i start telling her what happened because i still have this guy’s card. i see his car again and it’s parked in the middle of one of the lanes in the parking lot. he gets out of his car, walks back in the restaurant, looks me in the eye, looks around, shrugs, and walks out. he gets back in his car and drives away. then a minute later a white honda pulls into the to go spot. 

the white honda was there to pick up for amy so that went smoothly. but i am still so confused as to why this guy tried to take amy’s food, then paid me, and then drove away without the food or his credit card. ",gsdboum,tfys

298,customer calls me and another server a liars over half a picture of beer," yes i spelled the title wrong and can't fix it, please enjoy the story though.  (i'm on the phone so excuse any bad formatting ot grammar.) also this is kinda long so tldr at end.

     so i kinda stumbled across this thread and i remembered something that happened at my work place around october. we're a buffet style place and we have about 6 diffrent beers on tap. well at the time i wasn't 21 yet and it was illegal for me to pour beer however i was allowed to serve it. my coworker at the time was a super sweet girl with a bit of a temper (this is an important detail) . and we'll call her h.
       well anyway she poured the beer for me and since my hands were full i let her follow me to my table where an older gentleman and his wife where. i forgot to mention this before but they both agreed to share a pitcher of beer however we ran out of beer after half the pitcher was poured. so anyway we deliver the pitcher and mugs and we both told the man, ""since we ran out of this type of beer, we can either get you half of another pitcher or give you half off of this pitcher."" he was was ""ok we'll we'll probably just drink this then."" we both said ok and went about working. 

      about 30 minuets later h comes to the back pretty angry and says to me petty loudly, ""oh my god! this guy says that we told him we could have his beer for free!"" i was confused because, we were both standing there when the man agreed to take half off this pitcher instead of another half.  anyway she pulls me up front and asks me if we agreed to give him free beer. quoted the conversation and explained the half and half thing again. well guy throws his hands up and says ""ya both liars!"" 
     well gm and manger in training come around the corner to this screaming match that im trying to defuse so h and i go behind the counter with gm while mit is trying to calm down the man. and h is so loud that the guy is yelling from the counter ""come up here and say that to my face!"" finially i tell h to go to the stock room and cool down and i'd explain to gm what was going on. 

     so gm went upfront and apologized for h's behavior and talked to the guy. (side note for anyone wondering where the wife was in all this, she headed to the car why he paid.) anyway gm offered to comp their meal and the kicker is that the guy....refused and insisted on paying for the food. i still remeber it sometimes, h quit a few months ago. and that's probably the worst match i've seen yet.
     also i want to add this as a side note that later on gm and mit pulled me to the side and asked if i told them we had bugs. because appartly the guy told my manger i told them we had bugs during the meal. so screw you to that dude.


tldr: older gentleman is upset we wont give him beer for free, and gets in heated argument with hotheaded coworker.


edit: i don't know how i missed it but pitcher not picture. i'm honestly bad about spelling so my phone must have correted it and i didn't catch it.

300,"oh, you want the discount? hope you're ready to earn it.","okay, so i just got reminded of a story from my previous job as a server. right now, i'm working at a great restaurant but this story is from the restaurant i worked in previously. i won't mention the name but it was a buffet style establishment.

i was working my section when a group of four young ladies sat down in my section. they were an absolute delight. you know when a customer is just so cool you don't even care if they tip you, it was just fun serving them? these ladies were like that. every time i got the chance to run by their table to prebus their plates or refill their drinks, we were all smiles. joking. laughing. having a great time. but this story is about when they first sat down.

at this place, we didn't have a dedicated host or cashier. i mentioned it in another post but the owner of this place was both incompetent and cheap so servers were expected to drop everything and rush to the register whenever a guest was at the front trying to buy a buffet. it was a fairly middling night and i wasn't slammed so when i saw these four young ladies up at the front, i was up at the register in a flash.

for context, this place had pricing by age. we had the normal adult price, another price for seniors, for kids under 12, and kids under 4 ate free with the purchase of an adult buffet. pretty standard.

so when these ladies came in, laughing and joking and having a good time, i did my usual ""hey, thanks for coming in. four adults?"" and without missing a beat, one of them says ""no, i'm 4 so i eat free."" we laughed. i rang them up for 4 adults, and i hoped they would sit in my section. they did.

i came by and got their drink orders. all was normal. and then i enacted my plan. i went and got their drinks, went back to the table, set out three cups and then an absolutely tiny child-size cup. for about two seconds, there was absolute silence. the look of shock and bewilderment on her face was so incredible i wish i could bottle it. then without a word my table just completely erupts in hysterical laughter.

i went and got her a full sized cup, even while her friends insisted the child's cup would be fine for her, and we continued to have just a great night chatting and joking whenever i got the chance to swing by. it was an awesome table and they left me a huge tip for my good humor. all in all, those were just some really great customers.

tl;dr: got a table with a great sense of humor. gave one of them a child cup for jokingly trying to scam a children's price on the buffet. good feels all around.",Shilohpell,tfys
301,customer pees herself at the table. i would feel bad for her but...,"i work in a fairly nice restaurant and generally have nice customers (bar the usual few who think they own the place) so when i greeted this woman who had come into the restaurant i was friendly as usual, only noticing how she looked very tired. she was around late fifties, wearing normal clothes and seemed nice enough so i didn’t suspect anything unusual at first. 
then it hits me. the pungent stench of urine. at this point i wonder if she perhaps has a problem and didn’t want to upset her so i just continued as normal and tried not to cringe at the horrific smell. 

started off relatively normal bar the smell, she asked for things we don’t have on the menu but eventually ordered and we left her to it. she ordered our steak which is quite pricey compared to the rest of our lunch menu. 
she barely eats any of it and my co worker wraps it for her to take home. by now we’re trying not to gag as the smell has permeated the air and the place smells like a lidls public toilet that’s never seen a hint of bleach. 

while taking payment i spot the huge (and i mean huge) puddle surrounding her. immediately i feel terrible for her. how mortifying, right? so i finish up and wish her a good day. she gets up to leave and the chair and everything around her is soaked. her expression is pretty unreadable at this point but to avoid upsetting her i decide to wait till she leaves to break out the mop bucket. this is where it goes south. 

she calls over my coworker and points to be floor. she doesn’t address the urine. instead she says, “i have dropped all my change on the floor. pick it up for me.” and there was the coins, splattered in her puddle of piss. i’m honestly surprised my co worker went through with it (she didn’t get the ones directly in the pee). though afterwards she was fuming. she ran off right away to bleach her hands. 

the woman left and my co workers theorised she was an alcoholic judging by several factors. my father is an alcoholic and i agree she gave off the signs. we then got the mop and cleaned up. the chair was put outside though. we’ll probably throw that out. 

why ask her to pick up the piss change?! i began to lose my sympathy then. 

just a weird day all in all.

302,middle-aged man called corporate on me after i told him we didn't have a certain flavor.,"when i was 16 yrs old, i worked at an ice cream shop that just so happened to be a chain (i didn't know until after this incident). i was only there a few months due to the season ending that fall, but i will never forget the time some middle aged man came and threatened to call corporate on me. 

so it was a warm, summer evening. i'd say about 7-8ish, when a guy came up to my window, and asked for a certain size of ice. i checked the back, and sure enough, we had run out of said size. he was *furious* and demanded that i give it to him, claiming that he knew that we had more in the back (we didn't, but ok). then he told me ""i'm gonna call corporate on you, boy."" to which i replied calmly ""ok"" (knowing full well that there was nothing i nor they could do about such an isolated incident). 

a few days pass, and my manager (who i should mention wasn't the best of managers) catches wind of it. she's just as mad, and began to berate me in the back for a solid 10-15 minutes, saying stuff like ""i know you're better than this, and i don't want to hear something like this from you ever again."" 

luckily, this was about 2 weeks away from closing for the season, so when the day finally came, it felt like getting out of prison for the first time. it's been 3 years now and i'll still never forget that man and his entitled attitude.

303,i let a bitter old woman know that i could hear her talking about me,"most of our clientele are elderly folks. often times,  i am the target for bitter old ladies. i get old women talking about me either when i’m right in front of them, or when i’m within earshot but they don’t even try to whisper. for example, i had an old lady ask her friend right in front of me, “do you think she speaks english?” 

ma’am i’m white just like you. just because i have brown hair and brown eyes doesn’t mean i’m not able to speak english.

another example: “her eyebrows are drawn on too big!”
(i wasn’t wearing any makeup that day, my eyebrows are naturally thick)

old women say the stupidest ignorant shit like this. i can’t exactly say anything back because #awkward, but it happens so often i finally had enough and decided that the next time it happens, i’m going to let them know that i can hear them, but without sounding rude.

well just the other day, i just so happened to pass by a table while seating a party, and as i’m passing by, the old lady at that table beats on her husband’s arm to get his attention and nods towards me, and says to her husband “get a load of this one!” 
she said it so loud it was like she wanted me to hear. as i was waiting for the party to sit down, i looked at her to let her know i could hear her. she saw me look at her, and quickly looked the other way. after i was done sitting the party, i went up to her table and asked, “is everything okay ma’am?”

she wouldn’t even look at me, “oh yes. everything’s fine.” 
her husband glared at her and looked disappointed in her. 

i just walked away. i hope she learned her lesson in not talking trash about the staff for no legitimate reason. i’m not even sure what made her say her comment in the first place. my mom says it’s jealousy, but hey, who knows, maybe she’s just bored.

bb looked at me with a confused drunk look.

bb: i mean where were you originally from?

me: im from denmark? i said with a confused voice.

bb: no, you are not danish. were are your parents from then (note: i dont look chineese at all and was one of the only danish person working at the time. i might pass for a russian or something, but really whats the difference).

me: denmark they are danish like me. i said with a higher voice. a bit anoyed at the time.

bb: then you grandparents cant be danish!

at this point i just stared at bb dumfound that somehow to him i cant be danish or anybody in my family cant be danish.

me: i will tell you this much my family have lived in denmark for over 300 years from what i know of (my aunt is really into our family tree, that she even looked into my mothers side of the tree).

bb: you dont sound danish.

me: i work at a chineese resturant what do you want me to sound like?

bb: you should learn to speak danish. (just why would anybody say that)

i did not look happy anymore at this point and his family could see that.

family: stop it bb. they said while pulling him away.

family: we are sorry for that. they went up to pay and left fast mortified by what bb said to me.

i dont know what this person was thinking i just know that it was not the last time somebody asked me: where do you originate from or and your family?",lavdjing,tfys
305,i got yelled at today for absolutely nothing.,"long time watcher, figured i’d rant about what happened today. i’m on mobile so apologizes for formatting issues. tl;dr at the bottom. 

apparently a couple of guests rode the entitlement train to my place of a work today, but this lady takes the cake. she was older, around mid fifties, early sixties and was sitting with a lady a few years older than her. they weren’t in my section, and by the time they’d sat down and gotten their drinks, i’d been cut. 

after they’d been sitting for a little bit i went out onto the floor to bus my section, which was directly next to the table they were sitting at. i hadn’t pick up a single dish when a i hear a very angry and drawn out excuse me. i turn around, the following conversation occurs. 

me: yes ma’am how can i help you?

her: we’ve been sitting for thirty minutes and nobody has even taken our order, can you please take our order? 

me: oh my gosh i’m very sorry. what can i get for you today? 

at this point she looks like she’s going to start frothing at the mouth. 

her: what do you think you’re doing?!

me: i’m sorry ma’am i was going to take your order for you?

her: are you serious?? you already took our order! i was asking you if you were going to bring it because we’ve been waiting for over thirty minutes for it!!

me: ma’am i didn’t take your order. 

her: yes you did. 

me: no...i didn’t. i’m not your server. i could find your server for you though. 

her: *yelling at this point* you did take our order!! i can’t believe this! you didn’t even put it in did you? now you’re trying to play it off. 

me: ma’am. i’m not trying to be rude but i’m not the one that took your order and i’m not your server. i don’t know where your food is. 

at this point the real server comes up (who for the record has almost a foot of height on me, wears glasses, and has a different hair color) and delivers the food. the lady is glaring at me the whole time, unwilling to admit she was wrong for screaming at a random server. she begins dropping off the food. the lady once again begins screeching that the food is wrong . 

her: i didn’t even order this. where’s my salad ?? 

server: ma’am this is what you ordered..i didn’t know you wanted a salad? i can get you a salad.

her: theres no point now. are you new here?

server: yes?

her: that explains why you’re so bad at your job. 

she immediately walks back to the kitchen. the lady then turns her gaze back to me. 

her: she didn’t bring me my napkins and i can tell these fries have been sitting in the window which proves it was for thirty minutes! 

(the ticket was on ten minutes) 

at this point i walked back to the kitchen and got a manager. when my manager checked on them and she told him as sweetly as possible nothing was wrong, then continued to berate the new server to the point of tears for the rest of the meal. i finished cleaning my tables and listening to her loudly complain about how the service sucked and everyone was soooo rude. fuck those people. 

tl;dr: a lady screamed at me, claiming i rang in her order though i looked nothing like her server. she then complained about the food and made her actual server cry by continually insulting her.

306,a postmates tale,"so, some background info: i used to work at a restaurant that got fucked by postmates placing orders over the phone and never coming in to pick them up, to the point where it was happening 2-3x a day, so we only allowed postmates orders to come into the restaurant to place orders and then wait for the food, so we would at least be getting paid for it. this obviously is an issue for postmates, because it's an option on the app where we could turn ourselves into a no call restaurant. also at this restaurant, we would get rly fucking busy, our kitchen was small, our food took a while to cook, so we only allowed 3 to go orders (sometimes less) every 15 minutes to make sure we were prioritizing our dine in customers. this would lead on busy nights to postmates coming in and us having to tell them it would be up to an hour and a half to two hour wait to get their food out. obviously, they would get pissed at us (sorry my restaurant was successful) and call the customers and sometimes the customers would just cancel the order. whatever, shit happens.

&amp;#x200b;

so, for this story, we have 2 to go girls on, but servers sometimes help answer the phone, or help customers picking up if they're busy in the kitchen or whatever. so this night, i'm serving and this man calls in and tells me he placed an order with postmates, the postmates dude (p) showed up and we told him it would be an hour or something so he called the customer (c) who said he didn't want to wait, so p left the restaurant. c also called and spoke to one of our to go girls to confirm that his order was canceled. everything should be fine.

&amp;#x200b;

but then a second postmates dude (p2) was sent by the app and showed up to place the order. someone took the order and p2 showed up to c's house. now, obviously, that's an issue with postmates. we don't have the tablet. all we do is take to go orders, take money for them, and send them out. c was livid. he was like i don't understand why you would take the same order twice after i called you to cancel and i was like 1. we have multiple people taking to go orders 2. people order the same thing sometimes 3. how is anyone supposed to remember your specific order ??? if we're so busy it's over an hour wait for to gos, we probably are too busy to think about your order.

&amp;#x200b;

i kept telling c he needed to contact postmates because either p1 or he needed to have canceled the order but he wasn't having it. i try to explain that i don't even do to gos, i'm a server, and i'm still helping on the phone to explain how many different people could've been involved but he won't stop yelling at me. i had fucking tables and finally just snapped and said, ""our job as a restaurant is to fulfill orders that are placed with us. i don't know where they go, i don't know who places them, but we were given an order and fulfilled. we did our job, talk to postmates."" and hung up.

307,uber eats driver gets inpatient and flips me off,"so here’s the setting,

the driver get there not 5 minutes after and we’ll tell her we’re working on it, and she’s totally cool with it. her dad or whatever keeps coming in and making angry gestures. 

about 8 minutes later we have the order and i don’t see the girl in the shop anymore. i look it to see the man driving away flipping us off while i’m standing there, with the order completed just shocked.

308,"waited on the owner of the companies bf, i now have a write up and will potentially be fired.","i am a bartender not a server but this is so ridiculous i had nowhere to vent.

i got transferred to a new bar within the company last month. sort of a promotion because it’s a larger bar, and more pay. i was warned the owner of the company comes in often. i’ve seen pictures of him. i thought i was ready.

last night this man came in and ordered a large carafe of our batched beverage- light ice. i informed him if he did that the cup wouldn’t look as full. i’m used to people asking for light ice expecting more liquor.

the guy was shocked i said this but let it go. then he asked how many cups of liquid are in the container. i said 3.5. he then demands i get an unopened container and we test with water. i giggle but say no. he then presses me. i say it’s unsanitary. at this point his friend tells me to ignore him he’s being facetious.

once i get them their container, he starts emptying it in cups. it came out to about 2 full cups without ice. that’s when i hear “take your cameras out mark is going to hear about this”. mark is the owner of the company, i instantly realize they are friends (later informed one was the bf). i finish the order and call my bar manger who isn’t working what went down. for the record i got permission from the manager on staff to do this after i told her what happened.

i got to the back, call and come out. to mark standing at my bar. mind your this is 9 at night on saint patrick’s day. he introduces himself and says his friends said i was being rude when they asked for less ice then walks away. 

to get to the end of it he spoke to my manager. i’m getting a write up for being on my phone, and he’ll be calling my store tmro to talk to the general manager. 

i live in a state where they can fire you at will. i’ve seen this man fire someone for being on their phone in the front of the lobby.

update: i didn’t expect this to explode, i really appreciate he support. 

i have been with the company for a while and have worked multiple locations. the main bar manager (the one above my store bar manager) got in contact with me. she said i did the right thing and will be speaking to the owner she also will try to ratify the write up if i have proof i was only calling my manager.

edit: i mean it’s supposed to be 3 cups with ice in them. only 2 without. i can’t just give someone a pitcher without ice think of how much alcohol that is for like 20$",justunjust,tfys

311,client tried to steal my tip money to pay for another client's meal,"this is my first post but it is a story that happened a few weeks ago that i think fits well on this subreddit.

tldr at the end.

&amp;#x200b;

context for the story :

so i work at a tim hortons in montréal, canada. (for non canadians, tim hortons is a a café, kind of a mix between mcdonalds and starbucks) and montréal, being a big city, we often have to deal with homeless people hanging around sticking by the doors, trying to earn a little. 

&amp;#x200b;

story : day was normal and everything was going fine so far until a customer comes in the shop with one homeless man i knew. now it isn't that uncommon for people to bring homeless people in to buy them meals (and i think this is great). although most homeless people are banned from entering our restaurant (for lewd behaviour, or stealing, etc) this man was great and always kind to me so i welcomed them with a smile.  


client : hey i would like for him to have a big coffee, 2 creams, 2 sugars. also a chipotle wrap. 

  
me : alright! anything else? :)

  
client : no i think this is all, i won't take anything for me, it's all for him!

  
me : wow that is very kind of you! \*looks at screen\*,  ''6,30$ please''

  
client : \*looks at me kind of dumbfounded\* uh... uh ok well i can pay for his coffee i guess?

  
*she then proceeds to give me 2,20$ for the coffee.*

&amp;#x200b;

now i am very confused but ***to be fair*** clients are such aliens at times i am barely affected by odd behaviour anymore. i just shrug it off and politely asks for the remainding of the money to cover the sandwich fee.

&amp;#x200b;

client : well i don't have enough obviously, can't *you* help this poor man out?

&amp;#x200b;

me : what?

  
client : i paid for his coffee already, least you could do is split the bill with me.

&amp;#x200b;

me : (without mentionning that obviously the sandwich was the costlier item), i am not allowed to give away food, i am sorry :/.

  
client : well then, buy it?

  
me : uh.. no?  


*at that point, the previously humbled and happy man now felt super awkward (*ofc he did*).*

&amp;#x200b;

client : can't you make an effort? i'm trying to do some good here!!

&amp;#x200b;

me : \**now shifting my tone*\*, i understand but i can get very much fired for giving away food and for reasons not of your concern i am not in a position to pay for another person's meal. (to be fair with you reddit people, i could have paid for this man's meal but i know they are a tight community and that i would be asked to pay for alot of people's meals after that and i would have to deal with either guilt or dissapointment and i didn't want to set myself up for that.)

&amp;#x200b;

client : you don't have money?? what's this! \**grabs my* **entire** *jar of tip money*\* and smash it back on the counter.

&amp;#x200b;

me : this isn't even mine, it's all ours \**points to my 4 other coworkers, who by that point had gathered closer to me*\* so yes, these 10 bucks may seem alot but divided by four, my share isn't able to pay for a sandwich.

&amp;#x200b;

*i quickly glanced at the man who was now looking at the ground, head held low. i wanted to end this as fast as possible because it was obviously dehumanizing for him to be in this situation.*  


client : well then! what does that make? about 2 bucks? \**puts hand in tip jar and starts collecting cash*\*

  
me : \**quickly snatches the jar back from her, and using the nastiest tone i ever used*\* coffee's ready at your right. bye now.

&amp;#x200b;

she finally left my till but was still staying around, not really picking a table to sit at. i guessed she might wait for me to leave to try her luck again and **so she did** (after a while working in customer service, you figure human beings out so accurately i swear). and there she was, trying her luck with another coworker of mine, by her was the homeless man, coffee in hand, waiting for sandwich that won't arrive.

&amp;#x200b;

they finally both left (without a sandwich) and this encounter really stuck with me because by the end of the whole ordeal, the happy man i knew had grown resentful towards us.. i understand how he could end up feeling that way so i am not upset he didn't understand our side of things.

i see all the time on social media people bragging about doing good things when their heart isn't even in it, but that was the first time i had witnessed it irl. she wanted to be the good guy (and she ***was***) but for some reason, she had to create this whole drama. i am sure he would've been happy with only a coffee, but by building his hopes up, then denying him that and shifting the blame onto us, has made him feel belittled and low. i absolutely hated it.

&amp;#x200b;

and heck! buy him the sandwich first, it's only 2 bucks more and at least it fills him up longer..

tonight, i greeted my table and realized halfway thru taking their order that he was a manager from my previous job that i ended up just quitting one day because of anxiety. everyone at the table was kind the entire time. they didn't like their appetizer, so i offered to bring them something else. they said it'll be fine as long as the food comes out soon. i apologized and told them i'd take the charge off their bill. i went back to the kitchen, got their food out, they asked for another spoon for the kids. and i forgot about the spoon because i had another table right by them that i had to, i shit you not, run back and forth from their table and the kitchen 8 times while my other table was eating...and then i completely forgot to take the fucking appetizer off. which i didn't realize until after their card was ran and they circled the appetizer. lol definitely started crying again while bussing their table. i hate myself and how i forget e v e r y t h i n g.

315,the surprise party ruiner,"so 20 ish years ago. i worked at sizzler my first ‘real job’ and i was the greeter at the register who took your order and customers made payment for the meal up front. 

in comes this dad, in his 40’s who announces it’s his daughters 20th birthday and he’s organised friends and family to come along for a surprise party for her. as each guest arrived he made sure to wait for me so i could get them to order and he would pay, then lead them thru to where the group was sitting in a corner area. ‘another one for the party’ he would proudly say each time... like friggin king of sizzler buffet.. the big spender.. 

this worked well for a while. until unbeknownst to me up he walks up with ‘the birthday girl’  and i say to her ‘oh lovely another person for the surprise party’

‘oh bloody great’ he starts huffing.. ‘ruin the surprise’ he stomps thru the restaurant and i can hear him yelling to everyone ‘she ruined the surprise’ 
‘the girl at the front ruined the surprise, she told karen about the surprise party’

i was so embarrassed. i was a 16 year old young girl getting chewed out by this older guy and his family watching on. and for some reason all these years later i can still remember that feeling of vulnerability/ embarrassment and awkwardness as everyone in the restaurant looked at me. he made sure to stomp around some more and dramatically huff and puff and of course the obligatory ‘i’ll need to talk to your manager’. he yelled and carried on for probably 20 minutes. (in hindsight maybe trying to get some sort of freebies or refund) 

so here i am - outing myself .. the surprise party ruiner. 
that’s me ! 

i felt so cringey when i remembered that story... for years and years. 

now of course i realise .. what a friggin dickhead.... yelling at a 16 year old girl in a restaurant like that.

317,wife apologizes for her husband making me cry-,"hi guys. i recently picked up waitressing as a second job and i've been succeeding fairly well. i've been at it since november and experienced the first and only time one of my guests made me cry.

&amp;#x200b;

i work at a very, very busy steakhouse/roadhouse. the kind that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. it was a friday night and i was given a 5-table section which increased to 8 tables (varying seat numbers from 2 to 8 people per table). in total, it had to have been at least 30+ guests in my section alone. i had been working all day (10:45 am until this incident, which was about 6 pm), and i was tired. it was one of those days where the kitchen kept making mistakes with steak temperatures and my tables were running me hard with request after request. you all know how it feels.

i was splitting up a bill and running cards/taking cash for an 8-person table when i saw a family of three sit down. a husband, wife, and their young boy. no problem, i swing by and greet the new family and tell them i'll get to them as soon as i'm done closing the other table's tabs. they nod. 4-5 minutes later i come back with small side plates and napkins and i set them on the table. i start to say, ""hi, sorry about that. my name is-""

the dad cuts me off and glares daggers at me. ""stop. just take our order. who knows when you'll be back."" he shoots me a horrible glare and starts ordering. i pull out my order pad and scribble down their orders. i smile, although my lips are already quivering, and say i will put their order in and grab their drinks, and start to walk away. the dad reaches out and grips my forearm, yanking me back. ""bring our drinks *now*, not later.""

now, i normally am not an emotional person and if it had been any other kind of day, i would not have sweat this interaction. but the entire day had drained me emotionally/physically/mentally and i started to sniffle as tears welled in my eyes and i pulled my arm away before shuffling into the kitchen. i have a history of domestic violence and he caused me a little bit of panic when he grabbed my arm, so i told my manager with a shaking voice what happened. she asked if i needed to step out, and i told her no.

i grabbed their drinks and brought it to the table, avoiding eye contact with the family as i my eyes were red and a llittle puffy from the tears. i did my best to hold them back. the wife said thank you, but the husband snatched the drink from my hand as i was setting it down. at this point, i was just angry that he was treating me this way after only making them wait hardly 5 minutes. the rest of the time they were there i had no other problems with him, and the wife even tipped me generously. she even apologized for his behavior, which i think is a little ridiculous seeing as he was a grown man acting like a total dickhead for no reason. what an existence...i hope his wife doesn't get treated like that at home. it's just so sad that the wife had to *apologize* about his attitude/behavior.",xpumpkim,tfys

319,lady screamed because the tables she wanted were already reserved for parties that requested them,"so it’s a party of four. from the very beginning, they were a real pain in the ass. didn’t acknowledge me when i greeted them, just went straight to the bar for happy hour. 

after happy hour, i see them just get up and go sit down at a random table without talking to me (the hostess) first. i quickly go over to them, and politely ask them if they had a reservation. thankfully, they did, because it was a busy saturday night. i then informed them politely that the table they were sitting at was not only for much larger parties, but it was already reserved. she said that was fine and moved to another table that was also, reserved. i informed her again politely that that table was reserved, and she put her hands on her hips and said, “well we had a reservation too!” 

i said, “yes ma’am but these tables have already been claimed by parties who requested these specific tables. we have to honor their requests. i can move you anywhere else that doesn’t have a “reserved” sign on the table.”

she replies, “you’re making that up! you just don’t want us to sit here!”

i then hold up the reserved sign that was on the table. she sees this, then shuts up, realizing that yes, *they are* already reserved. she finally moves somewhere else. after they sat, she said to me in a snobby tone, “so we’re not good enough to sit at a reserved table, huh?”

at this point, she was trying to start a fight. i just replied, “ma’am again, some parties request specific tables beforehand, and we have to honor their requests. next time, if you want a certain table, you can put in a request while making your reservation and we will honor your request.” and just walked away.

320,st. paddy’s day nonsense and possible stalker,"so this weekend sucked... i came back from vacation to the weekend that most of us dread. it started thursday and people were already out in full drink until your face falls off mode. there is a new customer there who swears that i must be new because he’s never seen me before. he’s asking me if i’m a local celebrity because it’s packed and i’m just like no... it’s st. paddy’s day weekend home boy. mind you i’ve been bartending there for 6+ years now and am actually the front of house manager. 

so as the night goes on and i’m feeling it because it’s busy as eff he’s just constantly throwing out semi creepy statements but nothing i can really call out. he finds out the days i work from another customer and i close like normal bracing for friday which i know is going to be 10x worse. 

ok now we have arrived to friday. it’s mega busy. regulars are fighting with each other over nonsense but i’m so busy i can’t even address any of the fuckery going on. creepy guy shows up again. i think nothing of it because i haven’t yet realized how weird shit is gonna get. he’s using the weird “local celebrity” line again and i’m just rolling my eyes and saying it’s busy because of st. paddy’s day. he then gets drunker and starts going on about how i’m perfect and like all the same things as him. dude is really building me up and it’s uncomfortable honestly because i’m just there trying to work my job. keep in mind that i am not only slammed at the bar but also with making drinks for the dining room. i barley have time to think. he starts muttering that he loves me under his breath and how quickly my bf can become my ex bf. 

every time i ask him what he says he just pretends like it’s nothing. he’s said that he loved me about 5-6 times.... the couple of times i manage to sneak away for a cigarette he follows me outside. it’s weird as fuck. still there is nothing to obviously call out. i started getting a weird feeling in my gut about the dude but it’s hard to explain because he’s never said anything explicitly that i can call out.

the night is ending and he’s still around. i get the feeling that he’ll try to hang and it’ll be an issue getting him out of there so i text one of my friend who is also a customer and ask her and her bf t hang while i close because this guy is making me uncomfortable. she picks up on it and starts asking him a bunch of questions like “do you live in the neighborhood?”, “what brings you to this restaurant?” innocent enough questions but he clearly can tell there is some reasoning behind it. he mutters something about me hating him which mind you i haven’t said jack shit and pays and leaves. they stay as i close the bar and i lock them out when they leave to finish up my drawer and leave. 

he came in on my shift last night again but was on his best behavior but it’s still off putting because i have a terrible feeling that is hard to put into words about the guy. 

tldr: i’ve got a bad feeling about a new customer but don’t have an excuse to kick him out yet. trust your gut and have good regulars willing to have your back. ",SupahRad,tfys
321,very satisfying moment,"on mobile ect. formatting blah blah

last night i took a table of 3 girls in their late teens/early twenties. they were extremely needy: they got about 5 refills of tea each, kept asking for different sauces and all kinds of shit, so i was basically just constantly running back and forth from the kitchen to their table for the whole ~1.5 hrs they were there; this is also while trying to keep all my other tables happy. despite all the stress i got them everything speedily and was very warm and polite. 


so then the time comes for the check. their bill was about $75 and they all paid separately. one girl left me about $1.50 as a tip, the other two left me absolutely nothing. normally in such a situation i would’ve broke down crying, but i remained calm and followed them out to the parking lot. i said to them, “hey ladies, i’m sorry but if you’re not gonna tip then you are not welcome back here again. thank you, have a good night.” and then just walked back inside. i’ve never stood up to a customer like that before and it felt so  good. 


edit: i’m getting lots of hate for this post. yes i acknowledge what i did was unprofessional and in any other situation like this i would’ve just taken the loss, but it felt good to stand up for myself for once. i just wanted to share what was (in my mind) a small personal victory.

323,less ice does not equal more alcohol,"disclaimer: i am a bartender


so back on new years eve we had to kick a guy out for berating some of our bartenders. we haven’t seen him since, but the moment he walked into the bar during our st. patrick’s day party on saturday night me and the other bartender working both looked at each other knowing this could get bad again. 

this time he had a lady with him. they ordered their drinks and paid (no tip, but at least he wasn’t a dick). he got a crown on the rocks with less ice. i poured it for him and was worried he would claim it wasn’t full enough because of the lack of the normal amount of ice, but he didn’t say anything and proceeded to order the same drink a little while later. 

then shit hit the fan when he ordered from the other bartender for his third drink and he ordered it with no ice and proceeded to freak out because it wasn’t full enough. we tried to explain how ice makes it look fuller but he wasn’t having it and told her he didn’t want that drink and wasn’t paying for it, but would still pay for his girlfriends drink. 

after he left i talked to the other bartender and we decided to not let him have another drink because he wasted two shots of crown and we went on with our lives. later his lady friend came up and tried to order another drink for him and i declined and explained why, ready for her to lose it on me like he had on new year’s eve, but she totally understood and they left peacefully! i know this story is kind of anti-climatic, but it honestly was such a relief to have someone so understanding when normally i just have drunk assholes berating me for refusing to serve them. 

why don’t people understand that less ice does not mean more alcohol? i ask for less ice sometimes, but i 100% do it to get more mixer because i don’t like strong drinks. i’d say about 75% of the people that ask for less ice want more alcohol and it makes me want to scream sometimes. sorry about the rant, i just needed to get it off of my chest. but shout out to that guys girlfriend for being so understanding!!",RookiePuck,tfys
324,here’s a tip! just kidding!,"not really a tale but just something weird that’s never happened before. 

i work in a small bar and tipping is not really a thing where i’m from.

a couple walk up to get their second round of drinks. i take the money from the girl and she hands me an extra 20. i was looking at the till and i thought she was handing me the small change (i thought she was about to say here’s the 20 cents) but instead she says “here’s a $20 tip!” my hands just graze the note (again, i’m still looking at the till and didn’t really process what was happening before she says “just kidding! i wanted to pretend i was giving away his money (referring to her boyfriend) and then snatched it back out of my hands.

i wasn’t expecting a tip from them but i also have never had that happen before. i think she was trying to prank her boyfriend and didn’t really think before she did it. i’ve only been a bartender for about 4 years but that was a first for me!! 

i’m actually flat broke so that would have bought my lunch tomorrow.

325,questions about minimum wage difference? first time serving!,"this is my 1st serving job as a college student at a large restaurant that opened in jan. i clocked out after 5 hours with only $17 in tips after 4 tables (1 table didn't tip at all)  is this just the restaurant for not having enough customers yet? i was told grand opening was coming up, would this actually bring an increase?

&amp;#x200b;

also i was told that employers pay the minimum wage difference if servers don't hit it, is this true? i will receive my first check next week &amp; i'm very iffy. the one thing that bothers me is, they have no record of how much i make in cash unlike the credit card receipts, so how will they even know the difference?

327,refused service for the first time today,"so i work at a tea shop cafe, and we sell all sorts of teas. black, green, oolong, you name it. this lady comes in with her family and orders a “regular milk tea”, which is usually black tea in a lot of places but i wanted to clarify if she was okay with that. then asks “what color is it?” i explain well... its black, so it’ll be black without milk but brown with milk. then she says “yeah that’s regular milk tea then” then i tell her “well its made with black tea, so i wanted to make sure” and we go back and forth for a whole minute. i can tell shes getting impatient then tells her husband in tagalog that she’s about to hit me lol.

at this point i tell her if she talks like that i’m not taking her order, then says “i dont care you stupid bitch you cant even answer a simple question” lol
i got so red, so heated, told her i could tell she’s never worked in the service industry before and that we didn’t need her money. they all left.

328,‘dis-discriminators-dis-discrimination’,"this one tickled me/made me roll my eyes...

i own a couple of cocktail bars in a very affluent part of the uk and one of them operates on a 90% bookings based system as its small, has no standing room and utilises full table service with constantly refilled, unlimited water and popcorn for guests.

anyway, the place is popular at weekends and we’re often booked out up to 2-3 weeks out. a lady came by this past weekend and upon learning there was no space (at 9.30pm, prime time, on a saturday night) claimed the bookings policy (once explained to her politely) was ‘discriminatory to customers’ (except she couldn’t say the word right, probably too drunk or stupid or both...).

now, the bookings system is, to me, the most un-discriminatory system possible. all i need is your name (doesn’t even need to be your *real* name) and an email address and you’re in (if there’s space at the requested time). i don’t need you to upload a photo, i don’t need to know your race, preferred gender pronoun or your income status. i don’t need to know what you’re planning to wear, whether you require glasses to read, if you have an illness or literally *any* other info for you to book that table. oh and there’s no limit on the amount of time you can stay again, availability pertaining).

is it just me who thinks that’s the very definition of non-discrimination? i need a quick sanity check on this one..!!",Holdemsworth,tfys

10% of your tips go to the bartender, 5% to the host, and 5% to the dishwasher, so total is 20% of tips.

i've worked at other restaurants and have always tipped out on a percentage of sales. don't get me wrong, i don't have a problem with tipping out in general because everyone is working hard together so it is definitely earned. it just seems strange to me to give 10% of my tips to the bartender even on shifts i haven't sold any alcohol. also, our tips are claimed for us by the owner and there isn't a paper trail of our tip outs which makes me concerned that i will be paying taxes on money i am giving away... just curious on any thoughts or input you might have. thanks!",samurettel,tfys
330,"got asked to work a.. triple? because you scheduled one server and one cook for the overnight shift on st. paddy's?! ..but wait, there's more!","on sundays, i work a double; breakfast at chain breakfasty place, dinner at local diner. it's the last day of my week of working only dinners, so it's cool. next 2 days off, 14 hours on my feet hasn't killed me yet. this week, i picked up saturday breakfast as well.


so. i get in today an hour before my shift starts and roll all the silverware in the place. none was done. ok. i hear my manager talking about how she's looking for volunteers to come in late night because it's fucking saint patrick's day and only has one server on and it miiight get a bit hectic. my idiotic face makes eye contact.


my other job is one block over. my idiotic face agrees to stop in after my dinner shift (close at 12). my idiot face just signed up for the elusive triple. treble? i'm a super nice fucking nice person, ok. i hate seeing places i work in distress. ..and i'm off tomorrow so i'll live.


shift goes according to normal. i'm scheduled until 3:30, usually cut before. my next shift at other place starts at 4, but it's right there so no problemo. except there was one girl on the floor and the next server was a no show. second week in a row. so i'm on the floor until 4 with a table, who actually was awesome.


everyone knows my shit. everyone knows i cannot stay. i do my sidework to the best i can (salad station, you know it's a bitch), the server still on tells me it is fine, that they understand i need to go. i did not leave anything a mess, everything was fine. i didn't sweep and left my last table unbussed and let everyone know, as i was already 30 min late for the other job. servers routinely do this at this place. no big fucking deal.


now look, i totally understand scheduled until times are subjective in this industry, but because someone else doesn't show up for their shift doesn't mean i can just stay forever until someone else can show up. i was on the floor an hour after my scheduled off time.


get to my other job and thankfully they're ok with my lateness. i'm a closer there. immediately i get bombarded with texts from the other gm about how my shit wasn't done right, how the cook had to sweep my section, how i didn't roll silver and how if my other job is affecting this job shit needs to change. and how i'm getting written up.


..first of all. i was wrong for not getting checked out by a manager, but the other server and the cook were all wtf why are you here, you need to get to the other job. they like me. the cook sure as fucking hell did not need to do my section, and i didn't even know he did. he did it because he likes and respects me and didn't want me to get in trouble. like god damn, if this other person had come to work, i would have had ample time.


so i go to other job and have a great night. customers are all great, my coworkers are amazing, management listens to me vent. offer me another shift to make up for the one i won't be working at the other place anymore. i almost cried.


feeling appreciated at your job is everything. i almost stopped by lenny's after i left tonight, just to make sure the overnight girl wasn't fucked. and because i said i would. but i didn't. sorry not sorry.

331,constant complaints,"this is mostly a rant post. i'm getting sick of these constant complaints.

in the last couple weeks, my restaurant has gotten way busier. during the off season, we mostly attract locals and business people. these days, we have been attracting a much more diverse crowd, namely tourists, older ladies, families, and a group of moms with kids.

our uniforms aren't revealing compared to other establishments in town. yet i get unwanted attention from ladies who look at me up and down in a disapproving way. the other day, a lady looked at me and scoffed ""short skirt!""

my main problem is that i've been getting numerous complaints about our food. my average tip went down by 3-5% in the last two weeks, from people getting angry at me for bad food. i check on my tables at least twice and they always say everything is fine. only when it's time to pay the bill, they start complaining and mention that the food was awful, took too long to arrive, they are never coming back etc. on top of my tips, my sales have suffered as a result of voids and discounts. i serve more tables, but my sales are considerably lower than they should be.

i don't really talk about my guests with my coworkers, i thought for the last two weeks i was unlucky and somehow ended up serving all the difficult customers. but my coworkers have been talking about how they've been getting a lot of bad tippers, so that's how i know i'm not alone.

i'm getting tired of dealing with multiple complaints. on top of that, ladies are extremely rude to me like i'm way below them. i'm very patient with rude people, but i'm starting to feel exhausted dealing with so many rude people in one day. it also doesn't help that our new manager lacks people skills. i heard he is friends with the owner.

i have served in many different establishments, but rarely came across people like the ones i'm talking about. i thought they will come and go, but i found out from coworkers that our usual crowd during the spring/summer season is generally difficult. we will get a lot of tourists who spend less, don't tip, walk out on their bills that we will have to pay for if we don't want to be written up. our section will be twice as big, but our sale will be the same.

i used to love my job, but i don't feel that way anymore.",dnltpbke,tfys
332,these stories made me never want to work food service again,"hey guys! i just discovered this subreddit through youtube narration videos, and i have a couple of stories from my 6 months of serving at a pretty famous restaurant in my college town that turned me off of working in the food service industry 100%. the first story is about a customer that seared herself into my memory forever, and the other is about the terrible management we had at the time. sorry in advance, this is kind of a long one, but i hope you guys enjoy.

so the first story took place about a month before i walked out the door for good (if my memory serves me right). it's a pretty slow day, and i only have one family i'm waiting on before a party of one walks in - the lady in question. she gets seated at the very back of my section, and before i can finish telling her my name, she cuts me off and demands water - you know, usual restaurant customer business - and demands that she is ready to order. fantastic. she orders what i will rename the admiral's dinner - basically a $30 plate of all of the seafood we offer in the restaurant, deep fried of course, with a side of fries. the turnaround between me putting the order in and getting the food was quick as, again, this was a relatively slow day. i audibly hear the food still crackling from being freshly fried, which is important because of what happens next. i set the food down before her, offering the pleasantries that a server would normally happen before a customer begins to gorge themselves, and i walk over to check on my other table. ""hey you!"" i hear as i get maybe halfway across my section. i pause and turn around to see what was the matter. this lady raises her arm up, her index finger extended as if she's pointing towards the sun, her eyes locked on mine. she than slams that same index finger deep inside the still-steaming cut of fried catfish, twirling it around. i just stare, not even sure of what to say to the sheer level of madness i was witnessing. ""this food is ice cold. send it back and put it in the grease!"" i oblige in shocked silence, and have the cooks put the food back for another round of being fried. it turns around in maybe a minute and a half, and i deliver the now piping-hot food back to the table. she again probes the food with her finger, making me wonder what horrible tragedy must have destroyed the nerves in her pointer finger. ""it's still frozen - why are you trying to serve me cold food?"" i offer a resigned smile - ""i'll go send it back again."" i bring the plate back to the window and shrug to the cook as he gives me a death glare for making him revisit the same plate a third time. i suppose you could say the third time was the charm as i brought the now-destroyed plate of seafood to the customer. ""hm... it's still cold, but i guess it'll have to do."" ""enjoy it, ma'am,"" i offer as i get out of dodge as fast as possible to serve another table that has just walked in. the rest of the service to her was pretty unremarkable, and as you can imagine the tip i got was nothing to really write home about, but i'll never forget the moment when her finger took a dive deep into the scalding cut of catfish.

the other story took place maybe 2 days before i called it quits at this place and swore myself off of food service. it was another relatively slow day, a couple of hours before dinner rush. the host sat a couple of kids, a 13 year old and an 8 year old if i recall, at the front of my section. i wait a couple of minutes to approach them, expecting their parents to walk in at any moment - this didn't happen. i walked up to the kids and introduced myself, and they ordered a couple of waters. i asked if their parents are around, and the 13 year old responds, ""oh, they'll be here soon."" i puzzled about this response for a moment but had to shrug it off. as i brought them their waters, the 13 year old's phone starting ringing. i stood there for a moment as she talked to her parents on the phone, and when she hung up she turns to me. ""i'm sorry,"" she says politely, ""our parents are at the other location, we need to go."" as they had just ordered waters, which are free, i didn't think anything of it other than to let my manager know why that table is clearing out so soon. what happens when i tell this manager what happened is the straw that broke the camel's back for me. i summarize the story as best as i can while the kids start to climb out of their table. the manager looked at me like i was some kind of ax murderer and screamed in my face, ""what did you do?!?!?!"" and quite literally ran to the kids, corralling them back to the table. shocked and confused, i slowly inched toward them, keeping just enough distance to watch the manager as she pointed at me and asking them loudly, ""did he do anything to bother you?"" the children looked about as shocked and confused as i was at this moment, as the 13 year old explained to the manager the exact same thing she told me, and the manager let them go. i couldn't even look that manager in the eye for the rest of the shift, and i think i might have worked one more shift before i just didn't go back.

the funny thing about this is that for about a year and a half after all of this transpired, every time i drove past this place their marquee consistently read, ""servers and cooks wanted."" i can't speak for the cooks as i didn't interact with them much, but most of my fellow servers were a pretty great group of people. the customers were a mixed bag of personality, of course, but the management was consistently awful the entire time i worked there. there was a ridiculous amount of turnaround within the 6 months i stayed - by the time i left, there was basically an entire new crew of servers. i can only assume that by the time they were able to change the marquee to tell the world about the food that they were offering instead of their job vacancies, someone within the higher echelons of ownership in the restaurant figured out that the problem was with the leadership, and it got a much needed shake-up to make things right... but i wouldn't really know, because i never stepped foot in that place again after walking out of my last shift.",Matt_themighty,tfys
333,customer asks to label each item of an online order after everything is packed. gets pissy when the assistant manager asks follow up questions.,"sorry, this is gonna be a long post. there’s quite a bit of context that i needed to write out for this. tl;dr at the bottom.

so i work at a poké place, and we get a high volume of online orders on cold days. we have 5 apps that we take orders from: grubhub/seamless (they are the absolute worst), ubereats, door dash, postmates, and caviar. the job started off relatively stress-free, but recently, our hours have been getting cut. so last night, it’s just me in the back, one person on the line, and our assistant manager who is 7 months pregnant. for some perspective, our morning prep person called out, and her replacement didn’t get there until after they opened, so she ended up leaving me a lot of dishes, and only half the prep work done (not her fault, and i’m thankful she came, otherwise i would have had to come in at 12). i also wasn’t really cross trained, so i’m a little slow when it comes to prepping some of the fish.

around 6:30ish, we get a huge influx of online orders, and a peak in our in-person orders, so i get called to the front. i’m out there for about 45 minutes, and the dishes, which i had just gotten to a manageable point start piling up again. i end up needing to go back to the kitchen, but i also asked the other employee to help me with something. our story begins with just the manager behind the line.

customer (c)

assistant manager (am)

(c *is coming in for a seamless order that has been marked for pickup, while* am *is working on another seamless order.*)

c: pickup for c

am: okay, right over here.

(*she moves to hand him the bags*)

c: can you label them, or is it too late at this point?

am: (*says something that i don’t hear.*)

at this point, i shoot the other employee a look, and stick my head out because i feel like she’s about to get chewed out. it’s not an unreasonable request, but there was another order, and his order was 5 bowls. the lids are also clear, so it’s fairly easy to identify what’s in the bowls before opening them.

c: what do you mean you don’t know how to label them? you work here, don’t you?

am: these are custom bowls, sir, and a lot of them have some of the same ingredients. i can’t just write a one or two word label that’s going to cover it.

c:whatever, it’s fine! just give me the food!

am: (*handing him the bag*) next time you order if you put in special instructions—

c: (*voice raised*) i don’t care, just give it to me!

she was trying to tell him that he can put special instructions on each bowl to write a name or number on each bowl if he wanted them labeled.

tl;dr: we were busy and understaffed last night, and a man wanted the assistant manager to label 5 custom bowls from an online that shared main ingredients. assistant manager tries to explain why this is difficult, and ask how she should label them. he gets angry, and cuts her off when she tries to suggest a solution for the next order.",blackcurry328,tfys

335,lady gets upset over $2,"alrighty, so this is less of a tale from your server and more so from your host.

i worked at a restaurant that had those ziosks where you could put in your orders for appetizers, desserts, and even kids orders. most notably, each ziosk had a small library of games that you could play for $2, and whenever you go to first play them, the ziosk would warn you about the small price. now that those details are out of the way, lets get on with the story.

i was at the host stand making sure the map was up to date when a family started leaving in a rush. i said my polite good byes and wished them a good night. as they were leaving, a lady walked up to the host stand(to me) and the conversation went like this, as far as i can remember at least, i know the key points.

ep-entitled parent

cs-cool server

cm-cool manager

me- myself and i

&amp;#x200b;

me: hi ma'm! is everything ok?

ep: so i got my receipt after paying and i noticed that there is an extra $2 tacked onto my bill.

i was still a bit fresh to reading the work receipts and i knew i wouldn't be able to give any input on receipts and pricing.

me: i'm not too familiar with the receipts yet so let me grab a server.

i turn to grab a server and at perfect timing a cs is already walking towards me and i ask him to help the lady in front of me as i was unable to. he agrees without a hitch and turns to the lady.

&amp;#x200b;

cs: whatcha need help with ma'm?

ep: i got my receipt after paying and there's an unexplained $2 on my bill.

cs looks at the receipt and instantly sees what it is.

cs: oh, that's the games on the tablet. someone at your table played the games and the games cost $2.

ep looks at cs confused and upset as if he just insulted her.

ep: my daughter was playing the games but i didn't know that they cost money so i just let her.

cs(still chill): i'm sorry about that ma'm but the tablet tells you it costs money to play.

ep: well i didn't know and my daughter has no right to charge money on my card so i want it taken off my bill.

me and the server knew what words were coming next so i got ready to move as he shifted so i can exit the host stand.

ep: can i speak to your manager?

i walk to the back and grab cm as she is the no bs type of manager. she was a bit busy at the moment so she said that she would be up front in a sec. i walk back up front and the ep was cross-armed and cross. i step behind the host stand and it was a few moments of waiting while ep made the occasional exclamation that the way we ran things was stupid, and that her situation was bs.

cm walks up and starts talking to ep

cm: how may i help you?

ep: i paid for my bill and noticed there was extra money on my bill because my daughter played the games.

cm: so you want me to take the games off your bill?

ep: yes, because technically having the games so easily accessed by my kids should be illegal. my daughter should not be able to make transactions on my card.

cm: i'm sorry ma'm but once a bill is closed it's final.

ep: my 17 year old daughter should not be legally able to charge money on my card and it's stupid for you guys to have it so easily accessible to kids under 18.

by this point, cs was to the back of the house into the kitchen. people at the bar, including other servers, were watching this lady cracking the waxed floor with her foot tapping.

cm: i could void the bill and ring it back up once it's voided without the games on the bill if you want. it'll take a few days for it to go through.

ep(fuming): no, i want my $2 now. my 17 daughter shouldn't have been able to access the games and that's on you.

cm: i'm sorry if this has upset you but-

ep: i'm upset that i have to spend two extra dollars on my bill.

the moment she yelled this i walked to the kitchen and all the servers back there look at me as cs caught them up on everything. there was a moment of silence before we all started laughing our asses off at how ridiculous this lady is. there is no way she didn't hear us with how loud we were laughing like a pack of hyenas. a few moments pass and cm walks into the kitchen and just stares at us in disbelief of the stupidity she had just witnessed. we laugh even harder and once i got my laughing fits in control. ep is still there, upset as ever. i ask if she's been properly helped, as i say that cm walks up with two singles and just hands it to the lady.

cm: there you go, will that suffice?

ep:yes

cm: alright, now you know for next time. be sure to tell your daughter.

ep(already preparing the mental leather belt): oh i will, i'll be sure to talk to her.

*exit ep*

after she left i connected the dots and realized that her family was the one that left in a rush, as they probably knew what type of bs that she would be up to.

336,shoutout to all the servers at themed restaurants!,"this past week was spring break where i live and we filled it with lots of fun stuff with our son, which included two themed restaurants. the magic time machine is a place in san antonio, tx, and dallas, tx, where the whole restaurant is full of different themed tables. you can sit in a teepee, a space rocket, a library, a pumpkin, an acorn, a carousel, etc. the waitstaff all wear costumes and play that character, such as cinderella, captain jack sparrow, batman, etc. our peter pan server was fantastic! 

we also went to medieval times, which is “a dinner and a show” where you watch knights jousting while you eat with your hands (no silverware in the medieval era). much more to it than that but you get the idea. the servers there have to be heard over loud music and actors speaking, often in very low light due to spotlights on the show, and have to wait on long rows of tables in levels, ie arena seating. they also wear costumes and have to call everyone “lord” or “lady”.

so i just want to say thank you and bless you if you have to wait tables and be “on” every night. that’s going the extra mile but it really makes the experience special for your guests.",shinygreensuit,tfys
337,shitty teenagers,"this is a long one my friends tldr at bottom:

last friday a group of teenage boys come in to my work and i think nothing of it-just another table. we’re an ayce joint where you cook your food at the table. pretty popular in our suburban wealthy predominantly white town. 
while two of them are sat they let me know that 5 others are in an uber on their way over. 
looking at their school uniforms i can recognize the private school logo that’s across the bridge from the public high school i went to not too long ago. and judging by the fact that they all have airpods i can tell these kids are as privileged as it gets. 
as soon as they are all sat they do not stop talking. everyone from all directions asking me questions, trying to order their first round of meats and even asking me if i have heard the new drake song (i haven’t). one kid in particular keeps asking me if i’m a liberal, and i mean he *will not** let up whatsoever, even going as far as telling me it’s for a school project.
at this point i’m overwhelmed with all the voices and answer yes. now, i live in southern cali- pretty much as liberal of an area as you can get(?) and finally the kid shuts up. little did i know i would just make my life ten times worse. the whole lunch itself is hectic with them constantly ordering-i want this i want that yadayada-but they also loudly talk about how they’re parents voted for trump and “yeh my dad hates obama” every time i walk over almost definitely on purpose like they want to bother me. 
then comes time to pay.  
fortunately, our restaurant has a rule stating that parties of 7 or more have gratuity automatically applied to the bill. now, the kids have mommy and daddy’s money for their meal so i doubt they even care about having to pay that/know what that means. 
unfortunately we have no split check limit. so, i get all 7 forms of payment, some cash/some card and walk over to my machine to start the long process. they decide that means to walk over to me and hover the entire time making jokes they think i can’t hear.
the kids that pay in cash hand me almost exact change, maybe a dollar extra, and snicker telling me to keep the change (use it to buy some liberal things) or (buy a trump poster)  the kids that pay in card write “lol 15%” (definitely not knowing he’s tipped me over 20% by writing that in the tip column) basically thinking that they’re screwing me over when they’ve done the opposite of that. 
the thing that bothers me that most about these kids is that ever since friday they have been to my work two more times-the last time they weren’t even in my section but my coworker was slammed so i stepped in to help him out. all the while i’m there they’re talking about my being a liberal and chanting trump over and over again under their breath when i checked on them. 
i don’t know what to say to them or if i can ask them to stop but most recently one of the kids patted my shoulder when he told me to “keep the change” and i just froze. knowing i can’t hit a 14 year old i just stood there but i don’t remember the last time i felt that angry. anyone else experience something like this? what do you say? manager doesn’t care at all when i brought it up. any smart comebacks?

tldr: privileged white teens frequently return to tell me to buy trump poster with my “change” and  patted me on the shoulder someone please give me a comeback that wont get me fired!!",The_1stYeti,tfys
338,my disability is useful for once,"to start off, i'm deaf in my right ear. not completely but enough where i have a hearing aid in when i need it. (work, outings with friend, movies, etc ) but i had forgotten to charge my hearing aid that morning so it ended up dying about five minutes before this happened. 

well tonight at work, i work graveyard, i had a customer come stomping in. i just knew he was going to give me some sort of trouble. i greet him and he just walks past me, sits at a booth and stares. 

mentally rolling my eyes at the attitude i give him a menu. now i'm the only server on floor, i have no host, dishwasher, nor manager. it's just me and my chef (i work graveyard). 

i tell him politely i'll be one minute as i go to help a guest at the cash register, he angrily shouts after me ""i need a coke!,"" (i'm honestly surprised i hear him since he was talking towards my dead ear) 
""i'll be _right_ with you!"" still polite but my back is turned to him as i'm picking up dirty plates off a table on my way to the register. 

i help the customer and go back up to get his drink order, deciding to act as if i didn't hear his order already since it's rude to just shout at someone and i'm a tad petty. 
""what can i get you to drink, sir?"" i ask as nice as possible. 
looking up from the menu ""finally! are you deaf or-"" 

the words died in his throat. he looked like deer in headlights when he saw my hearing aid. (it's purple and easily noticable) he stammered a bit and said loudly, but not rude, ""a coke,"" 

i nodded, ""sorry i didn't hear you before, i'm deaf!"" 
""no no it's okay, it wasn't important,""

from than on he didn't say or do anything rude, mean or slightly impolite. the best part was he tipped me ten dollars which really shocked me! 

i don't tend to let me disability cause any issues but once in a blue moon it's nice to see someone clearly fuck up and quickly correct it. 

tldr; 
guy comes in being really rude and snappy, but ends up accidentally asking if i was deaf till he saw my hearing aid, changed his tone and tipped me 10 dollars! ",MixedupMaeson,tfys
339,"you know you were wrong, but it felt so damn good you didn't care","i was the gm of a pizza place, the one that has the best pizza under one roof. this was also about 17 years ago (when it was still good), we had a special on stuffed crust for 10 dollars 1 topping, but also a mailer with coupons out that had a 5 dollar off coupon. (hilarity ensues). an older lady comes into my store (we are very busy because of the mailer and coupons) to get her order. it was a 10 dollar stuffed crust. she had a 5 dollar off coupon. i got called to the register from the back. i showed the lady on the coupon where it said it could not be combined with other offers, and said i would charge her full price, take the 5 off and let her keep the coupon to use again (the price would have been 8 bucks and i was polite, said it was in small print and i can see the confusion...) she lost her shit and wanted the pizza for 5 dollars. i decided in my head she was getting that pizza for 5 dollars. after 5 minutes of back and forth i was done! i told her, no, she not getting the pizza for 5 bucks, she said she didn't want it. i said that's fine with me, picked the box up above my head and slammed it on the counter on the side and threw the box in the trashcan behind me. then i put a smile on and asked if there was anything else she needed. she huffed and left and, yes, after the day i had that felt great! that was the wrong thing to do, instead of getting 5 bucks for something i got $0.00 and more trash, but i still smile when i think of that story.",zanderpell,tfys

342,how to get a job in the service industry with employment gaps?,"i just recently moved to a new town to go to college, i'm on some hefty scholarships so i figured i'd forgo the whole job thing for the first semester, save for some major-related stuff that paid below the minimum wage. what a mistake, i was basically bleeding my savings dry and i can't really afford to go with out a job this summer so i figured that i would attempt to break into the restaurant industry because there's good money to be made. 

i'm going to be home with my parents for the summer and i'd like to work a summer only job, i've worked in the industry before and i know that no one wants to hire someone for just the summer, especially since it's dry as hell, so i know not to say that kind of thing in the interview but, whats a good way to frame the gap? i don't want to lie, however it's about survival and i really need the job.

i have 3+ years of hosting, serving and kitchen work, as i have been working since i was 16 and i started at community college. my most recent job was four months ago as a pastry chef, which was consistent hours  and offered me a position for the summer but i'd only be making minimum and i'd like to make as much as possible.

any advice is greatly appreciated

343,talked myself into a lower tip.,"some background info:  working here in vegas, i see folks from literally all over the world, daily.  when it comes to a lack of english, younger chinese and japanese are the most kind and wonderful people.  if they are about to ask you something, and you can see them pause, you can sense they are working out the words in their head and the order in which to say.  they will phrase things almost as a question, and once someone (me for example) reacts/answers them, you can see their excitement as they managed to communicate in english.  it really is sweet.  no other culture tries as hard to speak english.


ok, so younger asian couple, as explained, little english, but they were trying so hard.  it's time to pay, they ask for the check, they hand me a credit card, and i then process payment and return with the paperwork.  at this point, all is well.  i speak slowly and even point, ""this copy is for me, this copy is for you"" and wish them a good vacation.  they said thank you several times and i was off to other tables.


first problem.  i came back into my station and i see him looking for me.  i make my way over and he's holding one slip in each hand and says, ""i no understand.""  so i nicely explain, slowly, ""this one, you total and sign and leave it here....this one is for you.""  he says ""ok..ok!""


second problem.  again, left my station, returned, and he's looking for me.  i was half laughing half thinking ""what now?""  i walk up and he says, ""so sorry, first time in american, is this good?""  i look down and he wrote a sloppy ""15%"" on the tip line, no total, but did sign.  overall, yes we know he did well.  he probably read some book about visiting the us that told him to leave 15%, so he literally wrote in 15%.  i was thinking maybe this was literally their first day, so i decided to help him a little  i said, ""it is best to write the exact number, so 15% of the check, like $10 or any amount you like, and then write in the total amount you will be paying.""  again, ""ok..ok!""  i feel he's got this now, all is well, i again wish them a good vacation and walk away.


third problem.  what..how?  i walk out and they are looking around for me.  i make eye contact, they get up, walk my way, and he hands me the check presenter and says ""thank you very much.""  ok, he just felt it was proper to physically hand it to me.  that's fine, i know i've seen some video before about one asian culture relating to business cards and handing one to another person if a very serious thing, you just don't leave it on a table, so i can relate this.  i toss it in my pocket, check my station do what's needed and make my way to a computer to close the check.  i open it to find he crossed out ""15%"" which was like $16.xx and wrote ""$10"" plus the proper total of the check plus $10.  i couldn't help but laugh as that's exactly what i told him to do, write a number like $10....so he did.",buffetserver,tfys
344,what can i do about a customer who has a severe odor problem?,"a woman at my fine dining restaurant came in a few weeks ago when it was dead. she smelled of piss so bad that we had to sit her at the back of the restaurant but it still drifted up to the bar by the entrance. bussers who walked by her table were holding their breath and even after she left the smell lingered. the server in her section admirably handled her with due diligence.


she returned yesterday on another dead night and i didn't realize it was her until i'd sat her in the middle of the restaurant. no customers complained but i could smell it by other tables as i was waiting on them. she tipped in cash and even the cash reeked. she mentioned wanting to come back on a busy night in a couple weeks.


my manager made it sound that they feel like their hands are tied. is there anything i can do about this? compassion in a dead restaurant is one thing but i feel on a busy night it would be awful for business.",yaybuttons,tfys
345,last night i had a party of 8 walk out on a $200 bill.,"normally i try not to post my issues on here because i can get over it, but i really need to vent and at least write this down. i can already tell this will be long so...

tldr; table walks out on $200 bill, i'm written up and essentially on the verge of being fired.

so last night around 7, i had a table of 8 sit down in my section. they were all really nice; 2 girls around my age (21), a wife and husband, and their 4 kids around the age of five through ten. initially they ordered their drinks, a few margaritas and a round of shots, then apps and their kids food, and finally their own food. let me tell you though, they had me running back and forth for drink refills and every little thing their kids needed and i did my best to accommodate them and they seemed happy and understanding, i only had a 2 table section but between them and my other table i was never in the weeds.

together they ran up the bill close to $180. everyone was incredibly kind, after they finished eating they even stacked their plates so i could pre-bus (which management really gets onto us about). 

well so i drop off the check and tell them ""no rush, just let me know when we're ready to take care of this"" to which the mother of the family picks up and holds on to. no biggie, i'm tired and ready to go home so if you take up my table until i'm cut then that works out. everything seems normal, i ask for boxes and give them out, even running to the back for special containers for certain food items. they still don't seem ready to leave so i just tend to my other table, but with every visit i turn around and ask them if there's anything i can get them. nope, they're good.

now by the time my other table directly across from them finished eating, i handed them their separate bills and they immediately gave me their cards to run and ask for boxes. i turn directly around, make sure the walkout table is doing fine, and head over to to run cards. i come back, hand out cards and receipts and thank them for coming in and have a great night. at the same time, look back and check my walkout table one last time and they're still not ready.

now tables here have a tendency to camp out so no one thinks much of it. if i bothered a manager with everytime this happened, i'd be bothering a manager hourly. i let them do their thing and hang out nearby the server station to keep an eye on them. i never suspected them of even thinking about walking out, but i didn't want to leave them alone for too long in case they were ready to pay and had to wait on me. at the same time, management expects us to run food when we're not busy. no biggie, i love to help out bc it makes the job easier for everyone.

i shit you not, i ran one tray of food, come back to check on my table and they're gone. the hostess are already planning to seat the table. i look everywhere for cash and immediately inform the host and a manager that my table didn't pay the bill and i can't find them anywhere. we even run outside to look, restrooms, circle the outside of the restaurant, nothing. one server tells me he saw them get up and they asked him where to pay, and he told them to sit down and your server will pay you out. now unless they weren't listening, i told them they could take care of the bill with me at anytime. so obviously they were lying about now knowing, but regardless they continue to slowly walk around the restaurant according to this server. at this time, i was running food like we are required to do. we finally accept they must have left without anyone seeing, and one of the managers tell me they have to call the gm.

our gm seemingly hates me. the other day he yelled at me for a customer mistake and cut me off when i tried to explain i gave the customer what they wanted, even repeating the order when they ordered. first time i cried at work, i was already sick and vomiting and management wouldn't send me home and i still had to work the rest for the night..  well anyways in this instance he yells about how long have i been working there and how i'm one mistake away from being fired. ohh and recently he limited me to a two table section for being to slow getting out drinks, not saying the things were supposed to say when at tables, all which are not true and any other server would back me up on. it's infuriating because i know i'm a hard worker and no matter how hard i try he seems to have it out for me. and it's obvious bc my friends who also work there have messed up more than me and in worse ways but he's never told them anything, which my friends agree is terrible.

well so, gm was pissed and blames me for not watching the table. apparently had a write up slip ready for me and had a ton of things that weren't even related to this incident written down. many which weren't true, but it's my word against him when it comes to corporate. i sign the form because i was scared and while i am not taking responsibility for the walk out, i'm being punished for ""lacking cash handling skills"" among other things. indefinite 2 table section. one mistake from being terminated, management has to make a plan to ""help me become a better server"" which one of the managers even admitted was bs. i'm just as good as my job as many other servers, but gm is widely know to be biased at certain races and obviously prefers the female servers. nothing i can do unfortunately. at the end of the day, i'm blamed for the walkout even though i feel like there was nothing i could do.

while some people are telling me to stay and prove him wrong, i don't think gm will ever think differently of me. i'm pretty sure i'm handing in my one week notice today when i go in. i'm sad to go, but i won't be at a place where i'm looked down on. a few servers offered to reccommended me at their other jobs, but my old job (which i still visit and love to eat at) offered me a bartending gig and i'll probably make just as much if not more, i'm just really gonna miss the environment and friends i made.

don't really know how to end this, i just feel like shit and my wisdom tooth hurts and i keep throwing up and i don't know how i'm even going to face gm at work today. ",responsiblepunk,tfys
346,unusual and horrifying experience,"i used to work at a restaurant that was kind of an institution in my city. everyone in town has worked there at some point in their life, everyone loves the signature dishes, manager knows every person of any social standing in town, etc. you probably have one in your city, too. it was awful, but i made decent money, so i stayed for about 4 years. while i was there, the most horrifying thing happened to me and, to this day, i think about it at least once a day. 

there was a woman who came in with her elderly grandmother. i could tell something was off with granny, but i just gave her my usual treatment and ignored the fact that she didn’t have much to say. everything is going swimmingly; i’ve served them their bread and their drinks. when i go back to take their order, the grand daughter orders for both of them. she’s having a sandwich of some kind and the grandmother had pot roast. i hated this dish. it is the stuff southern dreams are made of: slow cooked beef with potatoes and carrots in a thin jus that makes such a mess. as a vegetarian, i was always repulsed by the dish and would gag a little every time someone ordered it. that’s neither here nor there, though. 

i run the food, everything seems okay, so i give them a little space. about midway through their meal, i notice a bit of commotion at the table. i wasn’t sure if i should intervene, but felt a little concerned that maybe there was a choking incident or something, so i rushed to the table to check it out. to my horror, the woman had thrown up all over the table. all over her plate, all over the floor, all over herself. it was like something out of a horror film. immediately, i start to panic internally. the pair were very embarrassed, so i told them i’d go grab some things to clean up (what i was really doing was going to beg my manager not to make me deal with it). but, of course, my manager didn’t want to get her newly manicured hands dirty, so she told me to go and bus the table. i took a deep breath, accepted my fate and went to grab the plates from the table. i brought out a tray so as to come in contact with as little of this woman’s vomit as possible. i loaded the tray and took it back to the dish pit. i gloved up and threw the contents of the dishes into the trash can. i washed my hands, took another breath, then went back to the table. i am greeted by the granddaughter in a full blown panic because her grandmother’s teeth were gone. i had thrown them away unknowingly. at this point, i’m thinking that i will absolutely not be digging through trash after all the rest of this bullshit. the granddaughter, as if she was reading my mind, asks if she can go through the trash to find the teeth. i remove the flatware retriever and let her go to town. she eventually found the teeth. and i went straight home to shower. thank god they were my last table of the day; i would’ve felt terrible if i had served other tables after that fiasco!

tl;dr: old woman puked at table and i threw away her dentures. ",totemsinthenight,tfys
347,"""you obviously know nothing about service"". ma'am i am serving you as we speak.","one of my jobs is bartending in a large concert venue/bar. we do not do ""table-service"" (bringing peoples orders to their tables etc, we have to stay behind the counter. we have a runner who clears the tables for empty glasses and trash, but people are supposed to get their own drinks to their tables). this is very normal where i live, and your table is generally not served unless you are in a resraurant with food. there are two bars where i work. a large one inside the actual venue, and a smaller one in the smoking area. 

this weekend we had a very rich looking party coming in. they were dressed in expensive clothes and had a generally shitty attitude. i was tending the small bar and they order a bunch of wine. now the wine is stored in the inside bar, but since it was a slow night at that point i decide to go and get their wine for them, instead of asking them to go inside and order. 

it was a lot to carry, so instead of carrying it from the inside bar and outside and then wait for them to pick it up, i decide to just drop it off at their table as i was heading back to my bar. this was a mistake. 

from then on, whatever they ordered, they demanded be brought to their table for them - and later on the pace really picked up and it got super busy. i definitely don't have time to serve tables. i also don't have time to argue with entitled people about whether i'm going to excessively cater to them specifically when i have a long line of customers waiting. 

at some point one of the really entitled women came to the bar and demanded more wine. 

me: i'm sorry but the wine is stored inside. i'll have to ask you to go inside and order from my co-worker, thank you.  

woman: why can't you just go get it? 

me: because i'm very busy, sorry. 

(as she clearly can see lol) 

woman: well that's not very service minded. can't your co-worker get it then? 

me: she's very busy as well. (again, clearly) i'm sorry ma'am, but you'll have to go inside and order it. 

she complains some more but eventually heads inside. now the rest of the story was what my co-worker told med had happened inside the venue.

she had gone inside and ordered her wine, and asked that it be brought outside for her table. my co-worker who was busting her ass inside with all the customers polity refused, and the woman just completely loses it. 

woman: i need the wine brought to my table. 

cw: i'm sorry but that's not a service we provide here - you'll have to carry it yourself. 

woman: wow. what kind of place is this. you obviously know nothing about service. you're supposed to do what your paying customers are asking you. 

cw: i'm absolutely not. you can carry your own drinks. 

woman: so you're just really bad at your job then?  it's literally servicing your customers and you won't even do that. that's very unprofessional of you. 

she was very snarky and demeaning for the rest of the night but didn't straight up insult any more of us. like, i know she wasn't the worst but i just find it so ridiculous that a woman in her late forties who is definitely not working a low-paying service job has the nerve to lecture someone on service - while they are in uniform and literally serving her as she's speaking. 

sorry, but if you want the staff to legitimately kiss your posh ass then maybe go somewhere else more high-end, where a beer costs more than 5$. also, if you insult your waiter/bartender/cashier then fuck you. go home. you don't deserve wine.

348,"how i quit my first ""real"" job","so i worked at a mom and pop type sandwich and soup shop through out all of high school. it was chill for the most part a couple of my buddies worked with me and we usually always had fun. this place was owned by two dudes one ill call m and one ill call l. m was dope he was a big pot head and just a really chill down to earth kinda dude. l was the money man and a huge ass clown. i worked for them for almost 4 years (sophmore year to 19). i came in early a lot in my last year of high school to help out cause i had so much credits i only had 4 periods my last year. i also did a lot of off site catering for them doing picnics of up to 350 people. any way point is i busted my ass hard for these dudes for a while. so time comes where we all have to get food handlers certificates which i got no problem with i was taking some culinary courses and taking a food safety and sanitation courses so it actually helped a bit with that class. l had made multiple people cry there (my best friends gf, m's daughter whom was my gf at the time and a lot of the foreign work force they mainly used for catering incurred his wrath as well). so its about 2 days after we all recieved our certificates of completion and what not and one thing they mention is to not leave personal open drinks on the counter where food is being prepped/made/packaged. of course l left his open drink out and the person bagging the order put a lid on it (it was not specified it was his meaning no name on cup or anything) and bags it with a customers food. ya she prolly could have paid a little more attention but we were busy and tryna fly through orders. l comes out from his hole and goes ""wheres my drink?"" they figured out the person who bagged an order recently gave it to a customer and he started yelling at her and i can see shes on the verge of tears. then the following conversation occured in front of my whole team (i was the manager) and about 7 or 8 customers still in line waiting to order and a full dining room.

me: you know l were not supposed to leave open containers out on the food prep areas you should have taken that back to your office.

l: you know what kreeych why dont you shut the fuck up.

me: excuse me?? (cutting open sandwich bread forgetting i had a knife in hand and brandishing it at him) what in the fuck did you just say to me l??

l: you heard me you little shit i said shut the fuck up

me: you know what l you're the piece of shit and working for you is like working for a real dumb fucking monkey. no you know what? the dumbest god damn monkey on the planet could do your job better than you fuck you im outta here.

&amp;#x200b;

i dropped the knife and my apron on the floor and bounced. get a call from m about an hour later ""i'm sorry kreeych you done a lot of good by me but i think its best you not come back."" i understood and told him i hadnt planned to anyway and we had a good chuckle about the stupid monkey comment and he wrote me a letter of recemendation and i got my dream job as a server at restaurant down the street from them.   


fast forward 6 months and l is part of a commerce group that is having a shindig at the place im serving at and guess who gets to be the server for it? me. i was stoked it was one of my first larger events i had done 20-30 people parties no prob but this was about 120 people and i spot l walk in. que horrible pit in my stomach. i asked one of the other servers who was a little newer than me to make sure i do not cross paths with that man and also let the lead server know what was up. l eventually spotted me and came up to me and hes putting on his friendly face for his buddies so they dont know hes a dick head and of course im at work so i play polite. the newer server ended up taking care of his table. i felt kinda bad for this part but it was just so fantastic. she has a tray of about 7 drinks and shes bringing them to his table and as she setting one of the drinks down she loses her tray balance and completely soaks 3 guests at the table in coke/lemonde sticky nasty crap and lo and behold l got the brunt of it. ended up being one of my favorite parties i ever worked.

349,my last day on st patricks,"its been 8 years since i quit my downtown hotel bar job and it happened to be on saint patricks day. i was reminded of it, so i thought i would share.  
  
the hotel bar was going downhill due to management policy and a general change so i had begun to lose the type of money that would keep me there. i had put in a two weeks notice and it happened to coincide with st. patricks and smack dab in the middle of sxsw but whatever. i wasn't making the kind of money i used to make.  
 
it was a very busy shift, but being my last day, i just could not be bothered with caring. i took a cigarette break whenever i wanted to. what were they going to do, fire me?  i was only scheduled for a lunch shift so by 3pm rolls around, im done. i go say my good byes, which wasnt much because the place was very busy, and i say good bye to the current manager. that was met with a ""i didnt realize it was your last day"" whatever, he was one of the reasons for the place being bad.   
i walk to the parking garage to get my truck and head out and see [this](https://i.imgur.com/vn9thn8.jpg)   
  
i was lucky enough to have only one employee from another part of the hotel to see me uncontrollably crying. ive never had any people at a job do this for me, so it was so unexpected. the coworker who did it had to take time out of being on the floor with a full section and go and plaster my truck. needless to say, i remember this more than i remember to wear green.",TooBreezy,tfys
350,the time i lost my cool and swore at a customer when i was 16,"am i proud of this? ehhh. do i regret it? not really.

i was hosting at a popular bar and grill as my first job in high school. had been there for at least a year i think, and it went great. servers loved me, customers loved me, managers loved me, as i was basically the only host that actually helped the servers out by pre-bussing/bussing, running food, the whole 9

we have bingo every saturday starting at 8. this meant that every saturday, like clock work, the place completely fills up by 6:30. we're on a wait for about an hour when i call out the next customers name. nothing. i call it out again. no response. i try a third time even louder, because i know some customers like to go to the bar while they wait. again, nothing. so i seat the next person on the list. all of a sudden, buddy who didn't hear his name 18 trillion times storms over to tiny little 16 year old me. i don't remember everything perfectly but basically he proceeded to call me a dumb bitch (swear to fucking god) for skipping his name and seating guests who arrived after him. refused to listen to the fact that i called his name repeatedly. about 3 minutes of me trying to figure out what he wanted to do go by, to be seated now, stay at the bar, etc, but he just decides to leave altogether.

welp. alright then.

first time i've ever been yelled at by a customer, and not to mention this was a fucking massive biker dude, so i was relatively shaken up. but honestly, i was more irritated at that point than anything.

and here's when everything just falls downhill.

one table opens up and i bus it off so i can seat the next group. i was basically running across the restaurant at this point because this table was all the way in the back of the restaurant. so i grab the group and seat them. they see another table right next to them leave and ask if they can push it together with theirs for their group of 5. i explain that they can't because that would turn into an 8 top and that's just not necessary right now since we need to seat as many as possible. not my rule. this angers them. 

they then decide they just want to move tables altogether, so once again i have to run across the restaurant bussing off a new table for them. they do this two more times. one of them being a table not even near where we are now. i am not kidding. meanwhile i have bodies piling up at the front that need to be helped.

the last time they ask to move, i completely lose my cool and slam their menus down on the dirty table, and huffed, and i remember this way too fucking vividly, ""you know what? sit here! sit there! sit wherever the fuck you want!!! because i can't fucking deal with this right now!"" 

the best part? i had a second job serving at the diner across the street and the next morning the universe decided to give me a massive fuck you. lo and behold, the same group of 5 strolls in over here for breakfast. i basically sprinted into the back, explained the situation to my coworker who took them for me, and avoided them like the plague.

so yeah, long story short i'm a little impatient (for the record i've been serving for years since and have not lost my cool on anyone else) (yet)",firfkdjfss,tfys
351,i had a really weird day.,"so i'll be honest, this isn't some crazy story with a wild ride and a big climatic ending. just a funny, strange occurrence from today. 

so i'm taking drink orders for a large party. there's a few small children, about 6 adults, and an older woman. i get to the older lady, and i ask what she'd like to drink. she opens her mouth, and all i hear is a high pitched pterodactyl screech. i sort of recoil back and raise my eyebrows at her because it's absolutely the last thing i expected to hear. 

""i- uh, wh-what?""

she just sort of looks at me confused and just says ""hot tea.""

it threw me off so badly that it wasn't until i was on the way back to make drinks that i realized what happened. she opened her mouth to speak at the same exact microsecond that one of the babies at the table started to scream, and it was so loud that it seemed to just be coming from everywhere. i came back with her tea and told her that i was sorry for giving her a weird look, and explained why i looked at her like a crazy old lady that makes bird-of-prey noises at people. the whole table busted out laughing, and she said ""well, i have been known to shriek at people"" to which her son replied ""don't worry man, she's been de-clawed."" they were really nice, and everyone tipped well.

i finished the day after turning tables with a john goodman lookalike, the second table of nuns this weekend, some guy who put mustard on a pancake, a crackhead, and someone who tried to order a rare hamburger steak. (i told him that i'm pretty sure it's illegal for me to serve that)

352,how do you guys deal with customers who just won’t leave?,"i’m on mobile, so don’t crucify me. i work at restaurant that closes at 9, it’s always closed at 9 and everyone knows we close at 9. 

last night, i’m doing my end of the night stuff, have my finger on the power button for the oven and a peach of a customer walks in at 9:20. my front staff try to politely tell her we are closed, to which she shoots back “if you were closed your doors would be locked”. i’m obviously frustrated at this point, i’ve been here since 1 and the night was a disaster and i just want to go home. i cave and offer to make her a pizza, thinking that they’ll be in and out in 30 minutes.

nope, these customers didn’t budge until 11pm. i closed my drawers and they just kept buying beer in cash to get around it. their last round of beers, the woman’s husband tells me he hopes i don’t have a family to go home too, i say i do. he replies that’s too bad, at least you’re getting paid some overtime right? wrong again, i’m salary. 

finally their kid talks some sense into them i’m hoping, saying that we closed two hours prior, they just laugh and say i’ll wait for them, what else would they be doing on a friday night, it’s my job after all.

355,i quit my managing position today and here's why,"so first and foremost i will still be working here as a server.

i have been managing sunday brunches at the restaurant i work at now for over a year. it's been really great experience, but the last two months have been very difficult for me. so i basically on sunday  serve and manage. i can have anywhere up to 7-10 tables at once and on top of that i have to help with bar, other servers, kitchen, tvs, music, etc ( obviously you have to do a lot of shit when managing) it's not easy and the sunday brunch crowd can be very very very needy.

&amp;#x200b;

basically for the past two months when my gm gets in around 4 he immediately seems upset with me. he treats everyone else normally, but with me he's an asshole.  (he chooses people to pick on btw and it's no uncommon) instead of telling me what's wrong with the way i manage he passive aggressively will say things like ""see when i get here, things are done right"" or ""yeah, when i get here the girls get shit done"" or today for example he said ""you work harder at night""

&amp;#x200b;

never once has he told me specifically what i'm doing wrong even when i ask he just stutters and changes the subject. it's always very vague and very  passive aggressive. i can only take so much as a person who is literally only getting paid $2 extra for this shit. i am simply over it. so this afternoon after my shift i txted the owner and told him to remove me from the schedule as a manager. he understood, but still i feel like for someone that does work as hard as i do and really wants whats best for the restaurant its just fucking unfair. i've tried talking to my gm, but it seems to go absolutely nowhere and then just becomes awkward between us. idk what the next step is and frankly i feel really shitty about myself. i mean anyone would if they are being treated like they aren't doing good enough and instead of being told how to improve, it just continues to be passive aggressive. rant over.",panicattackjax,tfys

357,rude customer trying to get free food,"i mainly work in the kitchen, the bar take orders for food (i assist with making the food and i plate up then run the food out) 

we are a member's club (serve very cheap alcohol and therefore we attract strange type of typically older customer who are very stingy and constantly try and get free food.

for example yesterday during a really busy shift i delivered a large order to a table of 6. where one guy had ordered chips (and paid for chips at the bar) but when i gave them to him he claims he ordered cheesy chips (which would have cost him 3.50 not 2.50). 

he proceededs to be rude while the rest of the table looks embarrassed. 

he wanted his whole meal for free. 

i said no obviously and said if he wanted cheesy chips he needs to head back to the bar and pay the 1.50.

the bar staff have worked here for over 15 years mistakes happen but if a customer had ordered cheesy chips they would have charged for that it's very hard to make that mistake. (hand written tickets with the prices and adding up all on the ticket)

364,i cried three times yesterday. twice two days before.,"on mobile so sorry for the wall of text. i'm a server in austin and this past week was sxsw. it was my seventh south by but usually i bartend. this was my first as a server and even though i usually work nights i was scheduled all morning shifts. i'm talking 7am to 5 or 6pm. we served brunch every day because it was easier for the kitchen to switch from brunch to dinner instead of brunch, then lunch, then dinner. plus, our brunch menu has some lunch-type options.
and let me tell you what i learned working ten straight days of brunch service. brunch people suck. they're so fucking needy and they fucking guzzle down their coffee. they act like they're the only people you're taking care of and complain about the smallest thing. i have been balls to the wall busy for hours on end as a bartender during south by and felt great afterwards. i've had people throw their drinks at me, cuss in my face and call me names. i've never batted an eye. i cried three times yesterday. three! not counting the fourth time when i sat down at my favorite bar after my shift and rejoiced that it was all over. it's so obnoxious when a table acts like everything is great and makes you think you did an awesome job then go complain to the manager about your service. or get pissed off because you don't have any drink specials and not tip. or run your ass off for a bunch of europeans for a two dollar tip on a 60 dollar tab. or insult your abilities as a server because they had to wait an extra minute so i could take my 12 top's order. i'm just glad i had an awesome, understanding manager who let me step off the floor for a couple minutes and watch my tables while i was gone. i'm so glad it's over. brunch sucks. people suck. brunch people suck.",unisparkle,tfys

367,when tables are actually nice and tip well,"i know this sub is 99% server horror stories, but i really wanted to share a story about a table that we had at my job this morning. 

for a tiny bit of background, i work in a neighborhood that has a lot of families with small children, and i work at a casual italian restaurant/pizza place that is extremely kid friendly. as a result, i see a lot of messes and spilled drinks and just general bullshit on the daily. 

so this morning we knew we had a group coming in with six kids and six adults. they come in, have balloons and a cake, and immediately i’m just like oh no this is gonna be a bad one.  birthday parties are usually a mix of extreme mess, parents who just let their kids run around, and also the old “take up a ton of space, order two pies, and then leave a $5 tip.”  

as expected, they ordered two pies and just waters to drink.  i’m not predicting anything positive to come out of this table.  but in a wonderful twist, the kids are sitting and behaving, the parents are helping to clean up, and honestly they’re not as annoying as i anticipated.  

they stay about an hour, and then one of the dads lets me know that they’re ready for the check. their bill is only about $48, so at most i’m thinking they’ll tip like $10.  

instead, they tip fifty fucking dollars. on a $48 bill!  and they helped clean up and apologized for the mess (which there literally was none because they helped clean up!). 

genuinely, this was one of the nicest tables i’ve ever seen, and i think we all spend a lot of time dealing with shitty people, and it’s just really really refreshing to have a table that is not only nice but tips beyond well and just doesn’t make you hate your job. so thanks, random family, for reminding me that there are still generous people who understand the shit servers go through and don’t take advantage of us.

368,so over this restaurant,"so i just got out of work after being reamed out by my boss for over an hour.

there were three people along the kitchen's bar who were drinking somewhat heavily. two women, one man. all in their late 40s/early 50s. they were at the restaurant for just under 3 hours. 

in that time, each one of them had:

- two 20 oz. beers
- 5 to 6 cocktails each of which are 2.25 oz. tequila

they started showing signs of getting tipsy (guy needing to stand for a bit but remaining leaning against the bar, one of them stumbling on our stairs to the bathrooms, etc.) 

so instead of outright cutting them off, and ruining their night, i decided to pace them and slow them down a bit. i would still go by and drop off waters for them, the server and i were constantly walking by and would check in with them so it wasn't like they were being outright ignored. 

the owner was not happy. he pulls me into his office at the end of the night yelling at me. saying that it's solely his decision who gets cut off or paced. that i as the one serving him, don't face any repercussions legally any ways (i am in ontario canada, so that's wrong buddy). that i should have come to him (despite the fact he was working on line in the kitchen, which was right in front of the people). 

there was also the fact that we were slammed all night, and understaffed (1 bartender, 1 server, 1 host working). and we do craft cocktails which are a bitch to make.

so i'm on my way home now, wayyyyy later than i should be. oh and i have to open tomorrow morning, and since we are still understaffed i will be alone in the restaurant for the day time while i have a party of 8, 10, 4, and 2 reserved to come in between 1 and 2pm, excluding walk-ins. which... its st patrick's days, we may be a restaurant not a bar, but it's pretty much guaranteed to be at least somewhat busy.

369,homeless man cant read the menu,"sorry for the format, first post and im on mobile. also its the middle of the night and i wanted to write this out because i think its funny.

i work at a place that sells soups, salads, and sandwhiches. its kind of a sit down place but you can order food to go. so just last week i was working a pm shift, and we're about 10 minutes from closing. we arent very busy in the last hour, just a few people here and there but we can still get our preclose stuff done. 

a guy and a girl walk in while im near the register on the line, and i greet them as they come in. they look to be late twenties/ early thirties. judging by the area we're in, the backpacks on their backs, and the fact that they went around the corner to sit down before ordering first, i assume theyre homeless or arent going to get food. this happens sometimes. whatever, as long as they leave by 10:15 it wont be a problem.

the girl is sitting down with their stuff and the dude actually comes up to the line (come from the wrong end near the register, not the front of the line. its not a big deal since no one else is in line so hes not cutting in front). im cleaning the soup station, greet him again and start helping him. heres bits of our conversation.

guy: so what is this place called?

weird question, but he did come in the side of the building where huge sign is not facing.

me: this is [insert name]! we serve soups (gesturing to the soups in front of us) salads and sandwhiches.

guy: oh ive heard of you before. 

i explain that i can help him with any of the soups and he can go to the front of the line where my coworker is if hed like to order a sandwhich or salad. hes only interested in the soups so i offer for him to sample any that he would like.

guy: (pointing at one of the soups) which is this one? can i try it?

hes leaning on the glass to get a good look at the soups, which happens a lot. this way he cant see the names of the soups on the stickers on the glass. there is a menu behind me with pictures of the soups and the names next to them, but they do look a little different than the pictures. i dont want to have to keep answering his ""which is this one"" questions because it can be a bit tedious. so i tell him

m: this is our clam chowder, and heres a sample. all of the soup names are up on that glass in front of you.

and this guy says the last thing im expecting.

g: i cant read

i have no idea if hes joking, but i was shocked because he definitely looks old enough to read. i dont want to make him feel bad for something he cant do so i just go through all the soups and decribe my favorite ones. he asks for another soup sample, and goes with the first one he got. i dont even stop to ask him if hes joking or anything, i just move one and he pays for the soup.

i am just so confused? how could a thirty year old man not know how to read? could it be that he is homeless? could he have missed out on any education as a child?

i think the general public will never cease to surprise me.

had a table where just one person arrived out of two. they sat at that booth for about 30 minutes before the other guest came. i was slightly annoyed to be honest. started serving them and the other lady really liked me. i complemented her and joked around a bit.

once the the entire meal was over. the tab was like 60 bucks. ended up getting like a 40 dollar tip which would have been the best tip all day. the ladies camped there for almost an hour. id check up on them periodically seeing if they want to order any shots or drinks or if i slightly interrupt them so they can leave. near the end they ordered shots which i was happy to rack up a second tab. as i gave them the second check. the lady tipped me a hundred dollars. i was ecstatic. she made a comment how she never felt so well served in a restaurant after paying out and how i was a great server. 

i was honestly just trying to hustle them out of here or get a second tab going never did it cross my mind they liked the fact i kept checking up on them. i wasnt rude or anything i honestly wanted them to leave. but 140 on what was basically just keeping up with two older ladies who didnt want to leave is the best tip i ever received. later on she became a regular of mine. she didnt come often but every time she tipped a solid 30-50% ",mentally-ill-rodent,tfys

378,“slam jam’s gonna need a bigger piece of fish...”,"i worked for a popular local restaurant in the tampa bay area of florida several years ago. i loved serving, and enjoyed the challenge of reading my customer as quickly and as well as possible in order to provide the best service (and thus the greatest tip). some customers like you chatty and involved, others just want their iced tea fresh and full, right?

one afternoon, a popular wrestler from the 90’s walks in with his entourage of 3 people. let’s call him slam jam jinglebows. he’s pretty huge with tattoos of.. let’s call them puppies on his scalp. they proceed to spend $118.00 drinking vodka cranberry, only slam jam eats. he orders a grouper sandwich, a very popular choice in our area. 

the grouper comes out of the kitchen and fills the bun by about 75%. i get that it’s like 2:45 on a tuesday and everyone wants to half ass it but as the server, as the face of the company, you don’t wanna serve that. and certainly not to a professional wrestler who has been drinking, right?

i say to the cook, “mike, is this really what i’m giving him?” mike squares up and says through the window, “if slam jam doesn’t like it, you have him come to me.”

i bring the sandwich out. i set it down alongside another round of drinks. he takes one look at his weak grouper sandwich with the obligatory dash of paparika across the top. looks at me, slowly stands up. i’m 6’3” but he’s 6’4”, 200lbs heavier and the tattoos.

“is this the grouper sandwich you’re serving me?”

“yes sir.”

“is that all of it? is there more coming?”

“that’s all of it.”

“slam jam’s gonna need a bigger piece of fish.”

“i’ll let the cook know.”

i hurry back, shaking off the fact that i just got stared down by the same cold eyes that stared down hulk hogan, big boss man and so many others. i arrive at the window.

“he wants a bigger piece of fish.”

“that’s the serving size.”

“go tell him that.”

“that’s your job.”

“go tell virginia (our owner) that.”

“you’re a pussy.”

“whatever, you go tell him.”

so the cook marches out there like he’s got some super power and shrinks the moment slam jam sees him coming. sh stands up and squares up.

“you’re the one who thought this was a good idea?” asked slam jam, motioning toward the fish.

“i will go make a new sandwich right now with two pieces for you.”

“that’s a good boy,” and he sits down.

slam jam got his fish. the cook got knocked down a peg or 3 in front of the whole staff. i only got an $8 tip though!

 i can tell everyone really likes me because i'm very helpful, friendly, and good at my job. so i was thinking of bringing up to management that i'm making less than minimum wage after tips, basically asking for a raise or possibly telling them that the money isnt worth it &amp; i'm going back to my old job.

on a side note, i really helped out the servers tonight. one server saw how piddly my tips were and said she would tip me out for helping her so much. then she ran out the door (didnt even say bye) and didnt tip me out... pretty annoying. maybe she thought i didnt hear her and she changed her mind, we were talking and she said she was making 20% all night and we work at a high end restaurant plus we sell a lot of wine, so i'm sure shes making between $200-$400 a night considering our sales, maybe more. our average price of a dinner is $25, not to mention the alcohol sales. the checks usually come out to $100-200+ and we have 25 tables which are usually packed on weekend nights like tonight.

i really like the work environment and people i work with but i'm barely making anything for the amount of work that i do. they told me hosts are basically foodrunners and bussers and that i would be making tips so i was expecting at least $10-$20 in tips a night when i started. this money isnt worth it for me tbh. in my last restaurant job i was making $50 cash for 4 hours of work and here my first check was $135 for 16 hours, i could have made $200 cash in my last job!

&amp;#x200b;

i was thinking of bringing up to my manager (who really likes me) that i'm making less than minimum with tips. 

i really feel like i'm being taken advantage of being a nice person but i want to stand up for myself the best way possible because i'm really hurting for money right now...

&amp;#x200b;

what should i do about these two situations? what's the best way to handle the server?

any advice would help me a lot. thanks guys.",need_some_advice25,tfys
383,manager wants me to work after puking all night,"i spent the week (my spring break) out of state visiting my immediate family. i visited mon-fri with my bus leaving friday night at 6pm. i purposely left home with the intentions of working my saturday double (my usual shift bc school). i could’ve stayed longer but did them a favor and told them to schedule me. i threw up before i even got to the station. i was nauseous the whole trip and threw up most of the night when i got back. i was hoping i’d sleep it through but that didn’t happen. i woke up at 7:30am and called the store, my coworker told me my gm was supposed to be in around 10am but usually comes in 15 mins late. alright fine no problem. i posted in our work group chat asking for coverage. no one responds as per usual. 

10:15am rolls around, she’s not there. i called her multiple times and she finally got there at 10:40am late af. i told her i was vomiting and i couldn’t make it in and she goes “why are you calling out two hours before your shift??” i responded “i tried calling you 40 mins ago and you weren’t there....” and she’s like “i’m pissed, you didn’t work all week and now you wanna call out?!?! do you even wanna still work here?!!!” 

ummm what the fuck??? as if i planned on being sick?? i’d still be back home if that was the case!! she basically insinuated that i was faking. i’ve literally served with a sprained ankle in a boot, with the flu - hell i served when my uncle was dying in the hospital! ...not that they cared. anyways, she told me to find coverage and that’s impossible for a saturday so i’m basically no call/no show today. fuck them.

we have 2 pubs. one of which is near the coast about 20 miles away. 

about 6 months ago our original gm decided to move on and quit. the manager of my location is now our gm and 3 of my coworkers became managers, 2 at the coast, 1 at our location.

we also have 3 new staff members at our location who have never done a day. one of which started five days ago. 

we have a bet going on who is gonna cry. 

today our box thing that keeps our beer lines cold broke. the supplier had to drive over 4 hours to get a new one and was working on replacing it until 1am. 

my gm got a call tonight right after we did last call that the other locations main water line burst. i thought he was going to have an aneurysm. he was driving out there as we were closing up. 

i discovered that we are down to about 10 bar towels that are supposed to last through the weekend. 

we are out of containers for all our backups to be made. our gm has to buy them tomorrow so we can finish.

 okay so i'm working lunch and it's pretty slow. i got a couple who were nice enough people, whatever. i take their food order and put it in. a few minutes later they get their food and i go to check to see how everything turned out. 
me- how's everything tasting so far?
customer- those fries are hot! 
so this was her first complaint and honestly i didn't even realize she was complaining! so i just kind of laugh and go ""haha great!"" because fried foods should come out hot. so i walk away and take care of my other tables. then i notice the woman walk to the bar and ask the bartender for advil. the bartender got the manager and the manager informs her we can't hand out medication to people. well she complains saying her tounge and throat are burned because of the french fry and she can't eat any more of her food! so my manager takes care of her meal and tells me to box up her lunch. at this point i didn't even know she was mad. i go over to box up her meal super polite with a big smile on my face and she wouldn't even look at me. i take them their check and the boxed up food. her husband pays and the whole time she's like taking pictures of her mouth and acting like she'll never be able to eat again lol. the husband leaves me a 20% tip still(thank god) but she snatched the check from him to circle my name and write horrible service on it.

“i’m sorry man, i can’t serve you since you’re still underage.”

“no it’s cool, my birthdays __/__/__!”

“i know, and you can come in on that day and i’ll gladly give you all the drinks you want but until that date i can’t give you alcohol.”

“come on i’m almost 21! why wont you serve me!?”

my manager sees this and comes to ask what’s going on and he, drunkenly goes

“i want a drink and she wont serve me!”

and i handed her his i.d. and she looks at it and tells him “because you aren’t of age.”

then he stands up and yells 
“this is fucking bullshit! the last bar served me! fuck this!”

by this time his friends are sinking into their chairs and the whole section turns around to see what’s going on and my manager, pretty over it, threw his card on the table and tells the whole table to leave. as they’re leaving he’s throwing his tantrum and his one friend came back in and gave me a $20 saying “so sorry about that.”

395,the day i tossed an unconscious leprechaun into the trunk of a porsche,"i work at a bar. during our annual st. patrick’s day parade, there was a little person who was dressed up as a leprechaun. he was a friend of the owners and he was very much blacked out and taking shots with people, takings pictures, etc. 

he was getting a tad too rowdy with customers so it was time for him to go. we escorted him out the back door and offered to drive him to another bar since it was snowing (there is a back room he can nap in at this other bar). he started running out the door but failed to see the metal safety posts and knocked himself out cold. the sound of him hitting the pole is still so vivid. 

we pulled him out of the small snow angel he made, carried him to the owners porsche, and placed him in the trunk for the ride down the street (he was covered in snow and liquor and there was no room in the car). in hindsight, if anyone actually saw this, it would have looked really bad lol

400,we got absolutely wrecked tonight,"this is a bit long but there needs to be a long explanation of why we got absolutely wrecked. tldr is we had a major redesign this week and we weren’t ready for the friday night rush and ended up with 50+ 30 minute tickets and our longest ticket was 42 minutes. 

so i work at that wing place and this past week we went through a major redesign. we changed half the menu and got rid of all of our paper wing holders (we call them boats idk what other people would call them) and changed to metal trays. 

the problem is these metal trays take up significantly more space than the paper boats and our window is already pretty small. so now our window feels even smaller and it fills up faster and i run out of room to work with quicker. 

so tonight i was on expo. i expo once or twice a week and serve the other nights. in the past i would pre prep a bunch of veggie boats so that way when it got busy they were already made and i didn’t have to take time away from expoing the food to make veggies. but now that we don’t have the paper boats and the veggies go straight on the wing trays i can’t do that. 

also we would also pre portion 2 oz cups of ranch so i wouldn’t have to waste time making ranch cups too. but as part of this redesign we got metal ramekins (did i spell that right lol) and our manager won’t let us send out plastic 2 oz cups to guests anymore but unfortunately whoever pre portioned the ranch cups today used the plastic ones instead of metal ones so i wasn’t allowed to use them. 

so now i’ve gone from having pre portioned ranch and veggie boats to nothing pre portioned so i was significantly slowed down. i’ll be honest i contributed to half of the shit show because of this. what really slowed me down though is that our veggie containers have to be in a large space cooler to keep them cold (not like a walk in cooler just a large rectangular open topped cooler) and so the veggies are positioned like 3 feet away from the edge of the window so i had to grab veggies with the tongs and carry them 3 feet to the window to put them with the wings. 

the biggest cause of the shit show was the cooks on burgers. as part of the redesign we completely redid our burgers. the meat itself is different and the cook times are different. the construction of the burger is different and on the server side ringing in the burgers are different so the formatting of the burger on the cooks screen is different. so the burgers were wayyyy late. 

overall it was just bad. i wanted to say fuck it and walk out so bad. half the night i had half filled tickets because the wings are easy and the wing guys were slinging them out but the burgers were holding them back. at one point my entire window was literally overflowing with food and i couldn’t sell a single whole ticket. i feel bad cause i feel like me and the kitchen really let the servers down. i definitely made a lot of mistakes (that 42 minute ticket was my fault because i sent a burger to the wrong table) and the cooks weren’t on their a game. 

anyway, rant over. i’m really glad i don’t have to work tomorrow night because i anticipate it’s gonna be the same story. ",flypilot,tfys
401,ice cream is too cold in the centre? would you like that microwaved,"so to start with i should state this is my first time on reddit so i have no idea what i am doing i just made my account to tell this stupid story. also i might add i am not a waitress but work in the kitchens as a dishwasher and dessert prep along with any other side jobs in the kitchen but this story does fit into here well enough so here goes.

&amp;#x200b;

so it was a busy night at the inn i was working at myself and a younger co-worker working furiously to not only do the dishes but also prepare desserts for the customers all by ourselves when an order comes through for a vanilla hot fudge without the sauce (vanilla ice cream with sticky toffee pudding sauce but in this situation just the ice cream) nothing big my co-worker makes it and sends it through glad to not have some ridiculous order and gets back to helping us.

not even a couple minutes later a waitress comes rushing down ice cream dish in hand partially eaten and wheezing with laughter ourselves completely confused as to why she was laughing so much. it was then between giggles she explained that the woman who ordered the ice cream had just complained that the ice cream was too cold in the middle and had it sent back.

now at this we were all laughing at what a stupid complaint it was all of us questioning if she even knew what the dish even was when she ordered it if she complaining about the cold. but once the giggles died down slightly on my side i saw my co-workers eyes glint with determination and a large grin spread across her face. ""i've got this"" she stated before taking the dish with now somewhat melting ice cream and headed back upstairs to the dining area the rest of us wondering just what on earth was going to happen.

it was then not a minute later another waiter comes down laughing alongside my co-worker who was also wheezing a bit  from laughing. it was then my lovely co-worker explained that she had gone up to the woman who had ordered the dessert and with the most serious expression she could muster and a completely flat voice asked ""would you like us to microwave it since it is too cold?"" apparently the woman was gobsmacked at this the waiter who was serving the table next to her at the time hearing this dying on the inside from laughter as the woman stuttered a quick ""no that's stupid why would you do that?"" before having the dish shoved back onto the table a grin on my coworkers face as she said ""then there is no reason to complain then is there?"" and walked off back to the kitchen the waiter quickly finishing up serving and making a quick escape to allow himself to laugh without drawing attention to himself.

from then on whenever we had the same order come through and we were both on together we would begin to giggle and quoting ""would you like that microwaved?""",BladeTheWolfArtist,tfys

404,tipping culture in america,"firstly, i wanna acknowledge that i’m not entirely sure this is the kinda post that belongs here, mostly because it’s not a “tale.” so, sorry in advance if this comes across as gauche—mods, do your worst.

honestly though, whenever i see a discussion of tipping online, it feels to me like servers and bartenders and other professionals who rely on tips for their income are sort of left out of the conversation a lot of the time. it seems as though the conversation is rarely started by anyone who has any actual experience in the industry, is what i’m saying. so i’m curious how y’all feel.

i know the way food service workers in america—and i say “in america” because i’m sure there are plenty of homies here from other parts of the world, i’d love to hear from you too—is kinda fucked up when you think about it. i’ve seen that episode of adam ruins everything. i feel like i’ve got a decent grasp on why it’s looked down upon. many fair points to be heard.

but, l also feel like a lot of people don’t realize how much it actually benefits us. yes, being paid $2.13 an hour by your employer is a joke, but i also recognize that, if things changed and i made an hourly wage, i wouldn’t make nearly the amount of cash that i do. there’s just no way. i’m sure plenty of us have had those nights where we make 40+ bucks per hour and walk away feeling great. no, it’s not consistent, there’s always gonna be those slow nights, those low-tipper nights, those nights where it feels like you’re busting your ass for nothing. it all evens out though, in my experience at least. i can make a sturdy $20 per hour average, entry-level, in any decently-populated part of the country. hell, i’d say i even enjoy the inconsistency. keeps shit interesting.

plus, i feel like the discussion often demonizes the higher-ups of the biz. i know there are plenty of managers who are total dillholes, but i also know that i have a sweet, sweet gig that works for my lifestyle; free meals, flexible schedule, preferable hours, all the time off i want, even health insurance if i want it.

i dunno, man. i’m rambling at this point. most of my coworkers aren’t as pedantic as i am and don’t care to entertain this kinda conversation, so i just figured i’d run it up the flagpole and see who salutes it, maybe gain some new perspective on the matter.

408,sexually harassed by teen boys with their parents,"i used to waitress at a popular restaurant in front of a great wolf lodge. it no longer exists and has been changed into something else. i was 19 at the time but look pretty young.

i went to take the order of a family of 4. mom, dad, two 16 or 17 year old guys. i take the parents order all normal and ask the guys what they would like. one says i would like the juicy vagina wrap. i pause. likely had a confused face and said i'm sorry.... what? they start snickering and say they would like the juicy vagina wrap. emphasis on juicy. i look at their parents, speechless, mouth open. 

mommy dearest just says okay boys that's enough. i finally get their order and go to tell my manager what happened. of course, he does nothing and says to ignore it. whatever. rest of their meal was fine and at the end i went to ask if they needed boxes or wanted dessert. 

the boys asked for the juicy vagina wrap to go. i avoided eye contact and said so nothing i can get you? they kept trying to push it so i said have a nice day. i walked away. to. this. very. day. i wish i had said something but it was my first encounter with sexual harassment at a job. so boys if you're reading this, my 'juicy vagina wrap' is 5 star, not diner quality and you couldn't afford it anyway. go tip your fedora at a different m'lady.

me: hi, how can i help you today? 

c: yes, i would like a burrito grande.

me being confused: sorry ma'am, we don't have any burritoes here. 

c looking perplexed but rolling with it: really? well okay, i guess i'll take a 5-layer burrito then. 

me becoming more confused and wondering why this person thinks i have burritos: sorry, we don't have any burritoes. we have all of these items!

c: are we at taco bell? 

me being very confused but entertained: nope, we're at chicken place.

at this point, she starts laughing and her friend comes over to poke fun at her bad vision. apparently, another person had dropped her off without telling her the name of the restaurant because her friend was already there. c wasn't able to see the menu and signs due to her bad vision and lack of glasses. we all had a good laugh over it, and it's honestly one of my fonder memories from my work. i figured i'd share it here in case others found it entertaining as well. :d",ImNot_SmallMouse,tfys
411,telepathy would make my life so much easier when trying to understand why people be the way they be....,"but then again, maybe not.

hi again! this time it's not so much a rant but it is a short tale from your server about two customers i had the pleasureof interacting with. also on mobile because i can't be bothered to go on my pc lol.

so for the first (in fact both) story, i didn't take their order but i did hear what went down (for both). insert a sultry older couple (70s at least) who pull up to my window.

me (with my best customer service voice/smile): hi! did you guys have the two large dr peppers and something else? (they didn't bother to finish their order after being told we couldn't hear them twice)

lady: we want two of your sugar sticks

i knew what item she meant, but i wasn't sure if she wanted two singular ones, not possible, or two packs. so i tried to clarify that. *big mistake*

me: so you want two orders of six? twelve in total,  correct? 

lady: no, we want *two* or your sugar sticks. (i could see her eyes roll when she angrily put up two fingers towards me)

me: alright, i understand (for real, but not actually, if you know what i mean). you want twelve in total, two orders of six, right? because they only come in orders of six.

lady (even more frustrated): no.....

cue the cycle continuing a couple more times before the guy cuts me off. guy: forget it, we'll just have the drinks.

as part of our policy, i again clarify that they had *just* the two drinks and nothing else. the lady was just glaring but the guy angrily says yes so i finally cash then out and they pull forward again. mind you this was during a rush so a decent sized line was behind them, luckily no one else was mad about the delay.

i then learn when the line stops *again* it's because said couple ordered 12 them at the other window. ugh.

next story is more of a side note, so i'll just post it here.

this time it  was just one guy. after 'telling' us his order, he cuts off my co-worker before she clarifies it, but then backs up, yelling ""what?!"" she didn't know what to say so he just pulls forward and i get to tell him the bad news (makes sense in a moment)

me: hi, you just had the two-

him: one! i just want one muffin.

me: okay, got it, then one muffin will be $1.50

him: they're not a dollar? 

me: no sorry, they haven't been for about a month.

him: why?

me: i don't know, it's not the store's decision.

after grudgingly giving me exact, he says says, clear as day, ""you guys are f-ing (uncensored of course) stupid."" idk what to say and he just moves forward. 

i wonder if this'll become a past time for me, getting sworn at by customers because of things i have no control over.

l : ""excuse me?! hello?! i want lemon with this""

l : ""look what you've done! you've spilled my drink give me a new one for free!""

a : ""no,,, you spilled it yourself,  if you want another one you can buy it""

l was not happy with this and goes up to one of a's coworkers 

""she spilled my drink! i want another one""

413,i once waited tables at a café i didn't even work at,"i went for an interview at a café for a supervisor position. the manager was not there so the server gave me an apron and said i could help out for few minutes to show my skills. cut to him training me on the pos and the two of us waiting all the tables during a busy weekend lunch. i kept trying to ask him where the manager was but it was very busy.

eventually the manager shows up and starts serving as well. i spoke to her a couple of times and she kept asking me to quickly clear one table, take an order, etc. and she would speak to me soon. so i carried on, especially since the other waiter was really panicking at how busy it was.

i couldn't answer simple questions like 'do you serve a salad?' without checking the menu myself, etc., which made me look crazy and useless. i told a few people it was my first day and admitted to another customer i didn't actually work at the café.

when it is a tiny bit quieter, i interrupt the other server and ask for the manager. he says she has left. i explain i have to leave for my actual job. he says they'll be in touch. at this point, i have not had an interview or a chance to ask my many questions about what the job even is.

a week later i get an email offering me a server position. i decline, obviously, and politely explained it was unreasonable to make me work 3 hours unpaid, not interview me, and only offer me a job i didn't apply for. two weeks later, i get an apology from the owner saying the manager has been fired.

415,this is my drink now,"i got sat with a 3 top during the dinner rush tonight. it looked like mom, dad (mid 50s)  and daughter (20s). mom already had a drink from the bar. 

i brought them waters and mom asked me for an extra straw. sure, no problem. i bring the straw back and she put it in her bar drink and set it in the middle of the table for her daughter to share with her. 

i was standing there watching this happen as i took their order and i wondered why the daughter hadn't gotten her own bar drink. so i carded her. 

she immediately looked down sheepishly and said ""i forgot my id.""

so i reached across her and removed the drink from the table and told the mom, ""i'm sorry ma'am, but since i physically saw her drinking this and she doesn't have an id, no one at this table can have any alcoholic beverages. i have to take this.""

mom - but she's 27 years old! 

me - that may be true, but i can't prove that. and the law here states that if i ask for your id and you don't have it, even if you're obviously of age, i can't serve you. 

mom - that's ridiculous. i paid for that drink already. you can't just take it. 

me - yes ma'am, i can. and actually, i have to. if i didn't, i would be breaking the law. 

mom huffed and puffed, but did not blow the house down. i walked away with her full drink and poured it out.

416,"cherish your regulars, people!","this happened a few days ago. 

i work as a bartender in a big corporate restaurant. we are known for our many taps (over 150) and it is common for us to make fun of guests only ordering a bud light or some kind of light lager because of our extensive beer selection. we don’t do it in front of guests and we really are just joking. 

we have those two regulars (d &amp; a) that live close by and have been coming for a very long time to the restaurant. they only drink the house lager, nothing else, which you’d think it’s something we’d joke about but this couple are the nicest, funnest guests we have. they go out with us sometimes, get hammered at the bar and joke with the whole staff. we love them. 

about a month ago we all went out for one of our coworker’s birthday and d &amp; a came out with us. everyone got plastered and i ended up losing my brand new iphone 8. i was super upset cause i had had the screen repaired the week before and i had forgotten to turn back on the ‘find my iphone’ function which apple employees have to turn off before they take any phones in. therefore, i was not going to be able to find it again. 

the next morning i showed up to work and d &amp; a are at the bar drinking tea and diet pepsi (someone’s hungover!). we laugh about the night before; they tell me d lost his coat (turned out an other server took it home lol) and i tell them about my phone. d tells me if i need it he could probably find me a new one as he has a phone he doesn’t use anymore. i thank him but don’t think much of it; he’s probably just being nice. 

next time i see him, he asks me if i found a phone yet and i tell him my mom is sending me her old iphone 5c from across the country. he reiterates his offer and i tell him to give me a number $ and i might buy it from him. 

monday night, he comes in and i see him walking to a table, which he never does (they always sit at the bar). so i follow him around the bar and yell out :

“yo d, what are you doing at a table you traitor!”

he turns around and i notice he is on the phone. he hands me a iphone 7+ box. 

d : “i’m trying to get it unlocked right now”

my mouth hit the floor. he didn’t expect any money from me or anything. i was flabbergasted!

he had no idea but my birthday was the next day !

i ended up paying for his whole bill and instead of making tips that night i owed the bar 8$ but it was so worth it.

419,some guy spread his testicle cooties on the spoons,"so i just came from work tonight. i work at a smoothie bowl place. during a buy hour a guy came in and asked for oatmeal. it was 6:30 pm and we ran out of oatmeal. he got irrationally angry and did the usual ""i'd like to speak with the manager"" thing. he stressed about how he's gonna complain about how ""he drove aaaall this way for some oatmeal"" like dude, the oatmeal costs $7 and its bland. 

he orders a smoothie bowl anyway. while my coworker was making his bowl he was looking at her and asks ""can you add a drop of nutella on it"" coworker says that bowl already comes with nutella. then he says ""can i have no nutella on it then"" coworker says ok and then the guy says ""but can you put a drop of nutella on it"" he ended up with like a teaspoon of nutella on his bowl. 

after he got his bowl sat down and ate it. made a fucking mess while he was at it and didn't clean it up. after he was done he went up to the counter and complained again for another 5 minutes and left. when he was gone, another customer who was sitting near him came up to us and told us what he saw. 

he saw the guy put his hand down his pants and touched all the spoons. we threw all the spoons out and called the manager. manager told us to call the cops. the cops came and we told him the story and gave a description. 

this guy wasn't old too. he was in his 20s. he had bleached blond hair and a mullet. we speculate he was drunk or on some kind of shit. and there was a kid in the store the time he did this shit. and he left the seat up in our bathroom.",uglylightsmanifesto,tfys
420,be nice to your server and you’ll get rewarded.,"so, usually i have a three “strikes you’re out” rule when it comes to dealing with customers! i’ll be nice until you’ve gotten three strikes, from being rude or annoying or whatever. each strike i’ll get a little less nice, and then finally, after the third, i’m done. i probably won’t smile, your drink is the very last to get refilled, and at this point i don’t care about the tip so if i don’t feel like helping, i won’t! 

just like i have a “rule” for mean customers, i have “rewards” for nice customers. 
so i thought i would share a few that might remind you to be a little nicer next time you go to a restaurant:

•ordering off the kids menu, it’s frowned upon by the boss, but if you’re nice, i’ll let it slide.

•switching drinks/extra sauce. at the place i work, we have to charge for everything. if you’ve been a big sweetheart up until you ask, sure! i’ll grab you some more sauce or sure, i’ll get you a different drink. and not charge you. 

•kids playing in the 21+ section. *this doesn’t happen often!* but when it has, were usually not busy, if everything is going well and you make sure the kids behave and we’re not busy, i would rather your children play than make a huge mess at the table. 

•”special orders” - anything that we have to make from scratch again is a pain. but again, be nice, and it’s usually not a problem, sometimes we’re even happy to do it - allowing the chef to show off his skill! 

•lastly, fixing your mistake. this is a very painful one. you order something and it comes out the way you order, but you’re not happy! blaming it on your server is the worst thing to do. i’ve seen people being charged for the “mistake” and the remake all because of how awful they were. a simple, “i’m so sorry, i made a mistake, i meant to order it like this” is a nice way to put me in a better mood, to make sure you get the food you actually want and comp it. 

like seriously, just be nice. we usually agree that policies are stupid and would love to let you have what you want, but if you’re a jerk, then forget it. 
remember: we have control over your food. we may not spit in it, but we can make you wait longer, get it cold, etc. 

edit: i’m surprised, but hate messages have came from this. i just want everyone to know that i’m very secure in my decision to let things slide for outstandingly nice people, and your hate mail or rude messages isn’t going to change that. so let’s not waste our time. 😊",Bubba_lynn,tfys
421,three job codes at once: or how i learned to love my servers and hate my job a little less,"i work in a popular arcade/restaurant as the front associate. i ring up cards, answer calls, and that's about it. today, at my new location i recently transferred to, i had to help out our servers because of our unlimited deal bringing in more business than usual and the fact that there were only 3 servers for the dining room and only one bartender at each bar. if not for the three parties that came in all at once and the fact that people would leave their tables to play games and come back, and maybe if they had the foresight to schedule an actual host or another server, maybe it wouldn't have been a small trash fire. 

i say ""small"" because i helped out. no silverware, so i rolled. no host, so i sat. on top of that, i still had to do my regular front desk duties and call up people one by one to let them know their table was ready because the intercom doesn't work. table chart? ha! i bussed tables myself to seat people, and tried my damndest to find a balance for my overworked servers and impatient guests.

and despite it all, i was thanked profusely by my managers who saw how i stepped up to help when i really didn't have to, and a guest tipped me because he saw me running back and forth trying to help everyone. i kept my cool and stayed positive, which is really growth for me because at my old store, i hated host stand since servers would refuse to take tables or disappear and i'd be left with a long list of angry and hungry guests. these new servers i'm working with worked *with* me to alleviate stress on everyone.

so now it's an hour before close and it has finally slowed down enough for me to type this and drink some water. still hate hosting, but the people i worked with tonight made it bearable.

i should add that there was another bar and self seating in the games, but people with the unlimited deal were literally hogging them for at least 4 hours straight and the bar was crowded. the dining room and dining room bar were the last resorts, and once the big parties all came in basically at once that kind of fucked everyone up.",vixxgod666,tfys

we don't hear anything more from them, until the restaurant starts to clear out and they are the only people in the restaurant. we see the kid jumping up and down on the table screaming before they leave, their area a complete mess.

425,"""door's open"" is an invalid response to ""what would you like to drink?""","on a warm summer day, a four-top of guys came in for an early-ish dinner (around 5:30). it was about 75-80 degrees fahrenheit (bout 25 celsius), and dry instead of the normal humidity where i live, so the air was perfect. we left both of our windows and the door open to allow this fresh air.

i think these guys worked at the microchip manufacturing plant nearby, because they were about 35-45 professionals with clearly plenty of money (nice dress shirts and one dude had a very expensive watch), but very little social skills.

drink order goes as follows: 

""what would you like to drink?"" -- ""iced tea""

""for you?"" -- ""beer on tap""

""and for you?"" -- ""...door's open""

took a moment for me to think of what to say, since it was a complete non-sequitur...and a very obvious thing to point out. 

""yes, that's to let in fresh air since it's gorgeous outside.""

at this point, the guy shakes his head and gives a weird look to somebody else at the table...as if *i'm* the idiot here. then he says,

""at this point, i'm not sure if you're going to be able to take good care of us...we didn't get our table for a little while, then we come into this room with the door completely open, and i'm just not sure we're going to be able to be taken care of""

i respond,

""apologies for the wait since that is beyond the normal wait times, but generally we leave the doors open every day that it's nice outside. we can definitely provide prompt service - if there's anything you need, please let me know. with that said, i can close this door if you'd like.""

luckily, the ""head honcho"" (seemed like their boss) was a bit appalled at this behavior, and said to me ""thanks man, everything is fine. we'll let you know. i'm sure everything will be great"".

everything went fine the rest of the way, and all is well. i told my manager what had happened and he got a huge kick out of it. became an inside joke with my manager and i. when we would pass each other in the middle of service,

426,"it's almost definitely been said before, but i can't stand managers with the backbone of a wet noodle.","the amount of shit some people at my place get away with is crazy. i work behind a bar at a bowling alley, and as its late-night, 18+ after 7pm, and has a few beer pong tables, people get rowdy pretty quick in a busy saturday night.

i'm convinced my (old, as he quit last week) gm lived in a state of perpetual fear, because he caved to everything. everything.

1. we hold lanes for 15 minutes after the booking time. its just a bowling alley, but its in a popular, fancy area of birmingham (somehow this city has fancy places). think marco pierre-white restaurants, £5 pints, that sort of thing. if we didn't have this policy, everything would be fucked. people like to take their time to bowl, and if you show up 45 minutes late to your 5pm booking on a saturday you're literally inconveniencing around 600 other customers later on. naturally, some people don't like this. i've had people say they're gonna jump the counter and smash my head in if i don't let them bowl. what does that get them? a free round of drinks for the inconvenience, and they're put on the next free lane even though we've been fully booked all day and you've just moved everyone an hour later to do that.

2. someone came round the back of the bar and tried to get into our redroom once because he was pissed and following a waitress. a different barman starts to push him back on to the floor and gets smacked in the mouth for it. security jump on the guy and push him out, as well as the guy who got smacked. an hour later i see this same pisshead at my bar. the gm let him back in because ""he said sorry"".

3. this group of four come in and act like cunts. loud, obnoxious, rude at the bar, blaming the £7.38/hour barmaid for the prices of the drinks, that sort of thing. wouldn't stop screaming and swearing, matched by them being ratarsed out of their mind. oh, this is at 3pm on a sunday. they get to bowl and about 3 frames in i notice all four of them chucking a ball down the lane at once. obviously, this will damage the machine, so i turn their game off as the am watches me with no objections. they ask me why, i explain, they carry on bowling down a switched-off lane and even bowl through the legs of a waitress who stood in front of them trying to tell them to fuck off. obviously, this could have broken her legs. they don't ask the am to refund them, they demand by saying their going to bang him out if he doesn't get them their fucking money. remember, they've intentionally tried to cause 5k in damages already. the am rightfully says that isn't his call and he's waiting for the gm to come out, who refunds them all and gives them another game for free.

is it a requirement for managers to be soft as fuck everywhere, or just where i've worked? i work weekends while at university and honestly the idea that i can get punched in the mouth by someone who will get no repercussions isn't worth any tips. ",wqzu,tfys
427,awful mcdonald's story...,"
let me give you some background information. okay. so i'm a 15 year old girl, and i work at mcdonald's. when i first started working there, i was on register most of the time. i was pretty good at using the pos system for lunch, since the lunch menu was easier for me. but i was awful when it came to the breakfast menu, especially because i only used it once for about an hour. 


so, i was on register completely alone! not only that, but there was a breakfast rush, and i was stressed out and honestly terrified. as i was pouring a woman's coffee, an old man, his wife, and grandchildren came up to the register. i gave the one woman her coffee, and went to help the customers. the wife wasn't nice, but wasn't mean either. she ordered food for the two little boys, and for herself. she then turns to her husband and says, ""and honey, what do you want?"" the old man looks pissed for no reason. and mumbles something to me. i couldn't hear him, so i leaned over the counter to hear better. he then proceeded to shout in my ear that he wanted a swiss and mushroom burger. the only problem with that, we don't serve lunch until 11:00 on weekends. so i told him exactly that. and he goes off on me... he started shouting about how i was ""a dumb stupid b*tch. and that they shouldn't have put me on register, since i'm so f*cking dumb"" i stepped back a few paces and he yelled at me for being scared. the restaurant was packed too, and everyone's eyes were on me. i bursted out into tears, because i have never been talked to that way. and no co-worker came to help me. they looked over and didn't do anything. so i had to stand there and take orders while crying.

428,eating/chewing whilst ordering,"i work as a barman and one of the things that really grinds my gears is when someone is eating something or chewing on gum when ordering. i often get customers sat at the bar eating some barsnacks (usually peanuts) that decide to shove a handful in before asking for another drink.

i don't need to point out how gross that is, they're talking directly to my face spitting out tiny bits of half chewed food. the other main gripe i have with it is the noises they make. today i had a lady munching on an apple whilst ordering, she didn't seem to care whatsoever. she was indecisive and took a good 5 minutes for her to order, by which time she was practically all the way through her apple. the smacking of her chops was so load and so gross i wanted to smack the apple out her hands and tell her to just get out. it baffles me how some people just don't seem to notice how gross and rude they're being. definitely the worst kind of customer.",ILikeBritButts,tfys

431,am i a jerk for feeling as it is not my responsibility to pay for vacuums for my workplace??,"tldr; see title

so i work at a franchise restaurant as a server and the environment is very different from anything i’ve ever experienced before. it’s very relaxed and i enjoy most aspects of working there. i am a college student who is away for school during the year and they allow me to pick up shifts and work as i please, it’s fantastic!! today i got a facebook notification that someone posted on our crew page and even though i am not currently working i am nosey and had to know what it said. another co-worker (same position as me, has been there many years but not management) was hounding the rest of the crew to pitch in for vacuums to clean the restaurant. at my restaurant there are tiny hand brooms which they provide but are basically worthless to clean food out of carpet. before i started working there the crew all pitched in to buy a vacuum to clean the restaurant as it drastically made the job easier. every year or so the vacuum breaks from so much daily wear and tear and the crew does the whole thing again. am i a jerk for feeling that i shouldn’t have to pay for equipment for my workplace even though i know it makes my job and my coworkers jobs much easier? also if i don’t pay for said vacuum— no one would feel bothered or even notice that i didn’t chip in because i am not there regularly— should i not be allowed to use it when i am working? when the new vacuums break down 4 months from now and a new pool is going it will be a season that i am regularly working, will it be an asshole move to refuse then?

432,attack by muffin,"this wonderful event happened a couple or months ago and my supervisor still laughs about it. 

another evening, another shift at a local coffeeshop. throughout the shift, a rough looking guy (he looked like he had been sleeping rough for a while) keeps coming in to change money. our manager always stresses that it's ok to change money because we have enough change, etc, so all the staff throughout the shift keep changing his money. at some point, the supervisor starts getting quite annoyed and asks me if i can stop changing his money that ""he had been in that day at least 5 times"" and ""we are not a fucking bank"". he specifically tells me that i should just tell him that the supervisor is too busy and that i cannot open the till. (this is true, only supervisors and managers have the key to the till) 

and yes, the guy comes back in to change money. i tell him that i couldn't change the money for him because my supervisor didn't have time to change it just now and that i have no key to the till. he is very visibly annoyed but leaves it at that. 

little did i know that he didn't really leave our shop but was watching us from the window. so, i am serving customers while this guy storms in yelling that ""i have been lying to him"", and that i ""made him look like an idiot"". i, still serving other, now slightly scared looking, customers, try to tell him that i wasn't lying and my supervisor was busy. he keeps yelling but i try to ignore him and serve the customers that i was attending to. 

i turn around to get something behind me and ""whoosh"" ""bam"" 

the guy had thrown a muffin at my head! luckily, it was a muffin and it flew passed my head, just brushing my hair but still... wtf. i turn around and the guy storms out. my colleague chases him trying to tell him that was unacceptable behaviour but the 'gentleman' had run off.

433,am i losing out or is this a decent pay?,"so i started my first ever serving job at a restaurant last week. i had 0 prior food &amp; beverage experience whatsoever. i signed on for full time but didn't realize that full time in the restaurant world meant long long hours, 5 days a week. 

the restaurant is semi upscale, but there's not a ton of customers, so half the time i'm just standing to the side and waiting on one table at a time. i feel like i'm wasting my time and my legs hurt anyways from having to stand all day. i think it would be better if the restaurant was busy, but then again, i have no experience and maybe busier would be too much for me to handle??

i'm still in my ""training period,"" so not getting full pay yet but incorporating tips, i should be making about $17/hr soon.

is that a lot or little in the restaurant industry? i have nowhere else to compare this job to... but i feel like servers work a lot less hours and make more :/

434,"ultimate revenge: a waitress story {x-post, insert all the disclaimers}","this is probably more of a revenge story, but one that i was somewhat witness to, and just one of the many bizarre experiences i had at work.

one night at work we were getting near closing, so i was busy cleaning my section and doing my side duties. suddenly my manager asked me to stay late and open a tab for a guy at the bar, and serve him for however long as he was going to be there.

naturally, i though this was strange as it was after closing time, and wasn't entirely sure if it was legal (my state has odd drinking laws), but i accepted because i needed the money.

i went to the bar and introduce myself to our mysterious guest of honor and found that he was also accompanied by a police officer, and, while friendly, didn't seem in a good mood- i didn't recognize either of them. i took their order and went about my work as usual.

after delivering some food and a few rounds of drinks i eventually ran out of things to do other than wait for another request, so i sat down, and happened to notice that the guy was sobbing. i asked my manager what exactly what going on.

as it turns out the man was a local small-time drug dealer. a larger rival group of five guys had showed up to his home, presumably to rob and/or harm him in some way. he wasn't home, but his pregnant fiancée, however, was. they gang raped her and stabbed her to death, so when he found out who they were he found all of them and set them on fire- all died.

he was tried and found guilty (i don't think he contested it), but because we live in a small jurisdiction the judge allowed a police officer to escort him to our restaurant to eat and drink whatever he wanted before he had to go to prison. i didn't catch for how long, but we were in a death penalty state, and i imagine there were people in the prison that wanted him dead.

435,thank you for serving us,"this is more of a ‘wholesome serving’ story than anything, as i know most serving stories on here can be rants and such which i totally get. anyways, here goes: so am server at a senior ‘independent’ living home. we also have an alzheimer’s/dementia building (super depressing) and when residents from that building come over to the ‘independent’ building to have lunch or dinner, they have to eat in a separate room cuz sometimes they’ll have outbursts in the regular dining room that’ll ‘upset’ the ‘independent’ residents. believe me, it’s happened before, and the ‘independent’ residents complained. anyways, yesterday i served a resident and her family, a party of 15, from the alzheimer’s/ dementia building in the private room. her family comes every other month, sometimes it’ll only be 10 or 8 but this time it was 15, i’m used to it tho. one lady, she comes every time. she’s a big pain in the ass. that room is kinda connected to the kitchen so if she needs something she’ll just wander into the kitchen and walk up to the cooks if she needs something, she’s even walked onto the line to grab something because the cooks ‘seemed busy at the time so i’ll just grab it’. it really pisses them and the ed chef and sous chef off and they’ve constantly told her to stop. anyway, unfortunately the extra people this time were very rude and picky. of course i smiled through it, let it go one ear and out the other like i usually do. everything came out perfectly, they had nothing to complain about but i knew they wanted to. what makes this wholesome was, the rudest people, 2 older men (it’s usually the old people) pulled out these pictures of older ladies. their late wives. they showed me and started tearing up a bit. they’re recent widowers and this is the first time they’ve been out in 3 months, just to come here and have lunch. the ‘pain in the ass’  lady pulled me aside before they all left and thanked me. she, she said it had been hard on them, they’ve been with those ladies since high school so “high school sweet hearts” and they were the love of their lives. i even teared up. she hugged me and then said i was “the perfect server for this lunch” and “really made it enjoyable, even tho they were picky and rude.”  in the end, they were polite and had smiles on their faces. i don’t like ‘bragging’ but this really made my day, and i don’t have many good days, especially at work so i just thought i’d share.

439,guy with perpetually pregnant wife keeps trying to scam free food,"tldr; basically the title. guy with supposed wife who has been pregnant for nearly a year repeatedly tried to lie for free food, but gets caught in his lie every time


i work at a very small independently owned restaurant. we usually have 3 or 4 foh staff doing serving, seating, togos, phone, etc. so we all interact with almost every customer. we're only open 5 days a week and only for dinner.


onto the scammer. in the past 10 months i've worked at this restaurant we have had an individual call our restaurant with the same story trying to scam around $60 worth of food from us. he always starts with saying he placed a togo order over the phone, came in to pick up the food, and when he got home the food (chicken) was raw, since his wife is x months pregnant they couldn't eat it. an understandable complaint. 


the first time he did this was in person before i started working and my manager was there and took his word for it (it was a legitimate complaint, he was already at the restaurant and she didn't want to cause a scene in front of a bunch of customers) so they remade his order for free and sent him on his way. i believe this is why he feels he can keep calling and we will keep falling for the same scam. i know of at least 4 times he has called us with this same scam.


the first time he called since i started working, my coworker answered the phone, and it was the same story. phone pick up order, raw chicken, pregnant wife. she asked his name and his exact order and looked up his order on the pos and surprisingly, no one had made that exact order with that name that night, or even the night before. we told him this and he got defensive, and we simply said if he had his receipt with his order he could come in and we would fix it for him, knowing full well that maybe 1% of customers take their itemized receipt. he didn't come in that night.


the second time he called was after we had made some changes to the menu and removed a couple sides. he called with the same story and i asked him for his name and order, already knowing where this was going. he tells me his order, with a different name from last time, and included some of the menu items we had removed. he said he picked up the order earlier that night. i told him this was impossible because we haven't had those items on our menu for weeks now so he couldn't have picked up that exact order that night, and he got flustered saying he picked up the order some other night in the past and was just now calling about it. i told him to leave his number and my manager would call him back, and when she tried calling to confirm the situation he had left a fake number.


the third time he called a month or 2 later and another coworker answered the phone. it was the same story except this time his chicken was burnt, like to a crisp. he again said his wife was x months pregnant (still!) and gave a different name. we thought this was extremely unlikely because the kitchen would never send out black, burnt chicken, and when we check togo orders we would never give that food to the customer and would ask the kitchen to remake it. we told him this, as none of us had seen any burnt chicken go out, and once again he got defensive. we told him if he came back with the chicken and his receipt we would remake his order for him. as expected he didn't come in.


fast forward to last week when he called before we opened, while we were all doing opening prep. he calls and tells us the same story of his still pregnant wife and that he picked up his food earlier that day. my coworker repeats this and has him confirm that he indeed picked up the food earlier that day, and then informs him that we weren't even open yet and so it would've been impossible for him to have gotten any food. he doubles down and insists that he in fact was able to order, pay for, and pick up his food hours before we opened. at this point my coworker is pissed off at his shenanigans and tells him that we know he's called multiple times before with the same story, she's spoken to him before when he last had this issue, and that if hes absolutely positive that he picked up his food earlier and that it was raw, to come in with the receipt with the date and time he picked up his food before we opened. needless to say we were waiting to see if he would show his face that night, but he never did.


i really hope we caught him in his lie this time and he gets the hint and stops trying to scam us, or at least thinks of a better lie for some free chicken. like i said our restaurant is small so i don't know if he thinks that he'll get lucky and someone who doesn't know his shenanigans will answer the phone, but we're all onto his bullshit.

441,"i'm sorry for trying to clean up your vomit, obviously, sir","so i just discovered this sub and boy do i got a story for you. it's long, sorry, but there's a lot to tell about this scumbag of a customer.  

bit of background info: i'm a 21f and i work in a local pub. it's not a big establishment, which means i usually work the night shift alone. that means i serve the function as bartender and waitress, as well as being my own manager and ""security"" (basically just checking id's and kicking people out that are too drunk). i'm not the scariest looking or strongest, but i usually manage. 

this absolute hell of a night happened last year on a particularly busy friday. the bar had been full all evening, and being the only one at work i had a lot to look after. 

i had been told that a big pub crawl party was to arrive around 10pm and they'd probably just go for one beer and then move on to the next bar down the street. fine, we have a lot of those parties so no biggie. 

so the party arrives, 24 people, and to this day it's still the biggest party i've ever served. i know it's technically not a lot of people but being the only one in a bar with 50+ people in it already, it was a lot to handle. 

so let's introduce mr a-hole. he is clearly the one ""in charge"" of the pub crawl, and is the one who places their orders. (sidenote, they're all co-workers, age 40-50 and working in a bank)

he is impatient, disrespectful and downright rude as he orders. he expects me to basically whip out 24 different drink orders, shots and beers for everyone within seconds (even though he can literally see what i'm doing over the bar/counter). he's the type of customer who's already huffing and puffing about how much money they're spending and how they should basically get special treatment/free stuff for this. (and for anyone who wonders, their order didn't exceed 300$, which is not alot of money for a group of 24 people). 

anyway, i finish their order and since the bar is already full and there's not really any tables available, they just hang around for a bit. 

not 10 minutes later i can already hear that there's something going on at the back tables of the bar. i hurry down there to see if everything is okay, and surely enough, one of the pubcrawl guests has vomited all over someone elses table. 

usually when people vomit on tables/floors, they leave by themselves, but this dude is so hammered that he's just sitting on a bench. i tell him to get out while i go and get mop and bucket. he agrees and starts to gather his things and i try and escort him to the door to make sure he leaves. 

we don't get more than a few feet away from the table before a-hole steps in front of us, blocking the path. 

a-hole: what do you think you're doing?

me: your buddy barfed, so he's leaving. 

a-hole: uhm, no he isn't.

me: no offense but that's not really your call to make. if you vomit you're out, that's the rules. 

a-hole: you really think you're in charge, huh? he leaves when i say he leaves! now let him go and get back to serving us!

me: look, this isn't debatable. i don't have time for this. please move, your friend needs to get out, i need to clean up his puke and then i'll happily get back to the bar. 

at this, mr a-hole literally gets all up in my face and starts lightly pushing me in the chest as he yells. i'm still holding on to his black-out smashed friend, there's still puke all over the place and people around us are starting to stare. 

a-hole: dont you tell me what to do you bitch, you dont have any idea how much business i'm bringing to this place and i could easily leave and take it all with me. what do you think your boss would think of you then? losing all this business by being rude. 

me: by all means sir, please do leave, and take as many people as you'd like with you. i don't want you here with that attitude and frankly, both you and mr. barf here need to leave this bar immediately. 

a-hole: we leave when i say so, you clean when i say so, and you serve us when i say so you bitch. 

me: it's vomit? i need to clean it now????

a-hole: you do whatever i tell you to

me: sir, i will call the police. you're not welcome in this establishment anymore, and if you're not out of here in 10 seconds, no one from your company is ever welcome here again. 

he then pushes me to the side to get to the vomit-table, and as he looks me straight in the eye, he pours the entire contents of his glass out on top of all the vomit as he yells ""well if you love cleaning so much, clean this up as well you fucking bitch!!!"" 

he then throws his glass so it breaks, and storms out. 

i then escort barf-buddy out (who frankly seemed embarrassed by the whole scene and happy to leave). 

several other customers came and asked me if i was okay, and even though i was a bit shaken up, i wasn't hurt or anything. i then get to cleaning up vomit, beer and broken glass. 

the rest of the night went by peacefully, and all his coworkers were polite (and embarrassed) and quickly finished and moved on to the next bar. 

i never saw mr a-hole again, fortunately.

that was the worst customer i've ever encountered.

445,i used to work at a kosher sushi bar,"i worked at a kosher sushi bar for 2 years starting from 17 and man do i have some weird stories. first off i know what your thinking ""wtf is a kosher sushi bar??"" and i'l answer with ""i know right? my people are so weird sometimes"".

basically it was a place that targeted the rather large portion of religious jews in my city. we served high quality salmon and tuna (both cooked and uncooked) rolls with the usual combination of veggies and we also had a some fake shrimp, fake lobster, and fake crabstick that added to the variety of ingredients while still keeping with the jewish seal of approval. coming from a non-practicing jew and a sushi lover i can tell you the food was amazing. the religious diet was like 75% fish anyways so a kosher sushi bar was honestly a really good call for my city. there were only two other places that served kosher sushi in the city. the first was a semi-club place that catered to a younger crowd, they had a few kosher approved rolls on their menu, and the other was a quick ""grab a combo"" hole in the wall with a questionable ""fresh!"" sign on the front.(this will be relevant later) my place was small but definitely the best quality.

so its lunch time one summer day some several years ago now and i'm bussing tables. lunch rushes weren't crazy like the night shifts but they certainly drew a large number of people in a small amount of time. we had the regular menu but shoved that one in the back in favor of a 6 option combo menu. the menus options were cheaper, varied, and most importantly saved on time, allowing the chefs to keep up with demand while still maintaining the high quality level of food. many of our customers knew this, they don't rush us, they know what their getting is the good stuff and many of them are happy to wait.

&amp;#x200b;

halfway through the rush the hostess goes to the chefs "" whispers an ""i'm sorry"" and flees to the hostess desk.

smack dab in the middle of the rush somebody has ordered 40 rolls off the dinner menu for pickup. this women has ordered some of the most time consuming ones too: the fried ones, the double wrap ones, a few orders of grilled salmon too. (btw we have platters, hostess basically begged her to get one, just to save money, but this women refused.)  we then find out that the customer is ""on a deadline"" and will be there to pickup in 20 minutes. head chef just said ""no were waiting till the end of the rush, deal with it"" the boss is coming in, its a whole thing.

so the whole restaurants scrambling, i'm cleaning tables aggressively to give people the hint that we need them out now. the chefs basically have to do a whole reset for this order, grab some more fresh fish and cook it all.

&amp;#x200b;

so i'm outside taking care of the outdoor seating area, dealing with the lunch rush when the customer walks in. try and picture what a young religious jewish trophy wife would look like. right off the bat she asks me   'jewish trophy wife' = jtw, me = m, boss = b.

jtw: you work here?

m: ye-

jtw : where is my order?

m: please take a seat inside, we haven't fully prepared it yet.

jtw: what?  i said 20 minutes?!!

m: i'm so sorry, but we honestly couldn't complete your order in that time, plus we had quite a few customers.

she was already fuming, i don't remember exactly what she said but she started yelling about how we should be treating her better then everyone else.  (to her credit her order was above 600 dollars. like i said this was some high quality sushi) she was causing a huge commotion and their i was holding a stack of dirty plates getting a face full of anger spit. it wasn't a good time. i tried to calm her down and told her the chefs were close to done (they hadn't started because of the rush) but she demands to see my boss. i run to the back to get him and jtw goes and starts yelling at the hostess.

so i find the boss, hes just pulled in and he goes up and ask whats going on. now my boss was a good dude, a very no nonsense kinda guy ( oh and also very religious. big bushy beard with the hat and twirls)  if you did your job, acted professionally, and met his very realistic requirements he would treat you very well. but if you didn't he would throw you out the door himself. many times i would see him sternly or angrily reminding staff about the importance of being nice and patient with customers. but today he was noticeably different. he had a very ""i don't give a flying shit who i yell at today...but someones getting yelled at"". he walked up to me, the jtw yelling still audible from the kitchen. he calmly asked me what going on and i explained it to him. without another word he left the kitchen and confronted jtw.she was yelling at him, the hostess, and now the head chef had joined in from across the room. all my boss did was try and calm her down at first. (she was a a semi regular, everyone kind of was but every few weeks or so her and her husband would come, i'm sure my boss had said hello once or twice)

i guess one moment he just snapped! next thing i knew my boss is raising his voice

b: you come into my place and disturb my customers!!? you think yelling will get you what you want!?you think you deserve special treatment!? my chefs work hard, my servers work hard i work hard to give you the food you want and this is how you thank me!?

at this point the two are in a yelling match, most of the customers have cleared out. the chefs are almost done her order.

finally they yelling ends their is an eery calm as i hand the women her humongous order of food. once she gets it she turns to my boss now sitting at the hostess desk,

&amp;#x200b;

jtw: you know you have been terribly rude to me, i'm your paying customer how could you treat me this way? this will be the last time i give you my business.

my boss just starts laughing

b: yeah we will see about that!

jtw: excuse me!?

b: i'l see you next time.

as jtw left she was red in the face. like i said before their were only 2 other kosher sushi bars at the city at the time and ours was the best by a long shot! my boss knew he had the closest thing to a monopoly and he was damn smug about it.

sure enough a week goes by and jtw walks in. she sits patiently by the hostess desk as she waits for her (much more reasonable) pickup order deliberately avoiding all eye contact.

*edit: some backstory: this is the newish regional manager for a franchised restaurant which is beginning to expand in the regional area. real piece of work. blazers and blue jeans all day. none of the staff like the guy but the owners do and the managers are indifferent. there were a lot of rumors about him (you know how servers and cooks talk) before he even started, as he was a key part of opening several big restaurants in the downtown area we are located in. he's one of those ""no one talks about what they earn"" (ya know, so we can pay employees based on supply and demand not on merit or years worked, etc). in fact, months ago, this same employee attempted to discuss concerns with him regarding pay roll and wages and he proceeded to throw a quarter at her with a flippant ""there's your wage"" attached to it.",rec1aimingmytime,tfys

449,"after ten years in restaurants i finally received my ""big tip"" from a truly awesome customer","tl;dr: incredibly nice old man gives me over $1200 in mostly silver change over the course of a month because he is just a really generous guy who wanted to share his garage change with his bartender 

so i'm (24f) currently a bartender at this really tiny and old fashioned kinda bar and restaurant in a small town, it's one of only 2 bars in town and it's been there since the 70s. i started out dayshift bartending which is where i got to know all the regulars. retired old men mostly with no shortage of stories or time to dedicate to happy hour. 

one old man, h, is just the sweetest. he's well off financially as a retiree and comes in for a few hours almost any dayshift i'm there to sit with the other regulars and play keno and have some beers. 

when i first started, h commented on how i didn't seem to like change. like coin change, i always tried to minimize how much i had to count back by utilizing spare pennies and such. he made it a little joke and would bring me in handfuls of change at first, gold dollars and things like that. then it escalated to jars of mixed change. $30-$40 at first, then moving over $100. he said he was finally taking the time to clear out all the change that accumulated in his garage workbench and basement over 30 years. 

finally a few weeks ago he gave me a gallon mason jar full of quarters. it was $660. never in my 10 years in restaurants has a customer given me an incredibly memorable tip (lots of very good ones over the years of course tho!) and here it was in a very heavy jar. all in all, the change jars ended up around $1200. and everytime he gave me one he said that i just had to buy him a bud light and a shot of courvoiser and the rest was mine to keep (of course i bought him many more 2 dollar beers than that!)

that day h asked if i wondered why he gave me the change and i said yes absolutely, but i wasn't gonna push it and start questioning his generosity. h then launched into the sweetest little monologue about how he was blessed with two sons who are doing so well in life but he'll ""never know the joy of walking his daughter down the aisle."" he went on to say that if he were to have had a girl he hoped she'd have been a lot like me. h told me he thought i'd put the money to good use on student loans and supporting my new puppy and that's exactly what i've used every cent for. 

h is a rare type of customer and human. he's so generous, not just with his bartenders but with everyone. constantly bringing in treats, buying rounds any chance he can, giving wise and helpful advice in the form of interesting stories. he's a really cool dude and a sharp contrast to his counterpart bar buddy, b, who will bring in overripe store bought tomatoes claiming he grew them in his garden to give to other bar goers and then awkwardly and aggressively hint that they should buy him a drink for his generosity. 

fun aside: when i was bringing home the change my dad asked ""now this guy isn't some sort of creeper, right?"" and i explained no he's not like that. i told h what my dad asked and he was just tickled by the word creeper. sometimes now when he comes to sit at my bar he'll ask ""you got a beer for this old creeper?""

450,getting a good tip because the server didn't want the table,"daria here!

some background: i am a host at a burger restaurant. i do to-go orders. 

so on this particular night we weren't extremely busy, but we weren't slow either. these two women came in and i sat them in one of the server's sections. the server came over to me later stating that she didn't want to table because they were just going to sit there with some wine while waiting for a to-go order. so, she passed the table onto me. 

now, in a previous post i had stated that i am underage in america, and my county only allows people 20 and older to be able to serve alcohol. (i am almost 19 so obviously i can't serve). 

this server got them their drinks and pretty much let me deal with them even though this was taking up a table in her section (not that it mattered because she was cut before their food came up). both of the ladies only got one glass of wine each, and just chatted with each other. a pretty easy going table. 

i handed them their check (about $96), handed them their packed up food, and they left me a $20 tip. now, for a host i typically get $5 or less on to-go orders, so this tip was like a gold mine for me. 

i offered to split the tip with the server because i did take up one of her tables, but she didn't want it. i left home with $50 in my pocket as well as anything i make off of minimum wage. i was a happy camper that night. ",Dogsrule234,tfys
451,so tired of my job,"i work as a busser at an indian restuarant it's my 1st job and i've only been working there a month but i'm already so tired of it last night was wednesday seems like it'll be a slow night right? ha no we got super busy and had a table of 12 come in along with a few tables of 5 we close at 10 i didnt get out of there til 11 and didnt get home til 11:30 thanks to people staying late and then having sidework. 

which is another problem i am so sick of tables staying late well past closing and/or coming in right before we close my boss will of course let them stay then us bussers have to stay too this is a common problem here and happens constantly. we also get big parties constantly the biggest group i had was a party of 18 but we get 14 and 15 tops regularly as well. i hate large parties there is something abt when people get in large groups they lose all sense of common etiquette they just ignore u and there a pain to bus. half the time when i try to pre bus they wont hand me there dishes and i cant get over the table to pick it up myself they won't hand me their glass to refill there water either i've honestly gotten to where i mostly ignore large tables. oh and my favorite part is large tables are the ones most likely to stay late just talking when im ready to go home.

my feet and knees always hurt thanks to this job which i guess would happen inany job but i hate it. the only things good about this job is we do get an employee meal free which a lot of places don't do anymore it's small and my co worker has prior restuarant experience so she can really help me a lot because this job barely trained me and basically stuck me out there. ugh so ready to be done ",fallen-summer,tfys
452,restaurant didn’t wanna pay me for training.,"this happened a few years ago, but it just popped back up in my memories. 

i was working for a local doctor’s office for about a year, then we discovered that the hospital that we were affiliated with was shutting down all outside practices. so we had about a month to find a new job. i heard there was a new fine dining restaurant opening down the street, so i went and applied, got the job the day i interviewed. i had about two weeks left at the doctor’s office so i told them i would like to finish my two weeks at the doctor’s (i was getting paid about $11/hr and needed the money) and they said it was fine to just give them my available hours to train. 

my first day of training, the manager tells me, “so since we’re new, we’re still in the process of getting employee numbers for everyone and getting them clocked in, so everyone has just been keeping their times recorded somewhere.” so i kept track of my times and dates on my phone. my first day went well and i was told they’d see me the next day. i showed up the next day, and they said they had no one to train me and that they didn’t know i was supposed to be there, so they just had me follow a food runner. this kept happening every single time i went in, i told them, “i gave you my availability, and you gave me a schedule. im coming in the days you tell me to come.” 

at this point i’ve been trained like 4-5 times, and it’s mother’s day weekend, they scheduled me to serve cause it was just a buffet and all i had to do was walk my tables to the buffet and serve them (made $600 in one shift!!!) anyways, on mother’s day they actually gave me an employee number and clocked me in, but i didn’t go back there for a while and not gonna lie, my fault cause i forgot about the employee number and still wasn’t clocking in the next few shifts i trained, but i still was keeping track of my in times. the managers called me in to the office and told me not to come back because “they never knew when i was coming and it was inconvenient for them since they never know when i’m showing up.” i was like, “i gave you my availability and those are the days y’all told me to come??” 

so i just told them i wouldn’t be coming back, just to pick up my paycheck for the training. the paycheck came out to $0.00, so i explained to the owners what the managers told me about not clocking in and they said, “it’s hard to believe our managers told you that, i don’t understand why they would tell you that.” and i pulled out my phone and showed them my hours, and they were refusing to pay me for not clocking in, but i told them i did what their managers told me to do! i finally got them to pay me a ~$250.00 check after they talked down on me. 

that place ended up closing down about a year after i left. ngl, they didn’t get much business the days i did train, they had a bar that was open in the back once the restaurant closed so guests could keep drinking if they wanted to stay, they had two giant ballrooms downstairs and a dining area upstairs. it was just too big to be able to keep running.",catsavvyy,tfys

454,touch my chickens and separate my coleslaw please,"  

i'm an aussie girl who lived in the blue mountains most my life. some geography savvy people might know the area for katoomba and the three sisters which were up the road from where i worked. 

i got a job in a chicken shop when i was 14 and kept it until i went to university. being so close to a big tourist destination but also the area being a general sinkhole for depravity and boredom, we would get two types of terrible customers, bad tourists and bad bogans (think aussie rednecks on scooters). 

m = manager

bt = bad tourist

me = me

&amp;#x200b;

**the first story involves the local hooligans coming into our shop.** 

we kept the chickens out the front on the counter in the a warmer with sliding glass doors. a group of young bogans come in, parking their scooters out the front before stalking to the counter to order a small chips. i took the order before turning around and chucking them in the fryer. as my back turned from the suspiciously-happy-about-chips boys, m rounded the corner to see them reaching over the counter to open the glass doors on the warmer and touch the chickens. he was rubbing their cooked skin when m screamed.

*""what the hell are you doing?!""* their response to being caught was laughter and acting like it was a big joke, backing off with hands raised in surrender but giggling among themselves. 

*""keep your hands out of there or you're not getting your food.""*

i turn back to flip the chips when m yells again, they had reached around a second time to touch the chickens. m was a very docile guy but he stormed into the waiting area and kicked them out of the shop without their food. i've got no idea why they found touching our chickens so funny.

&amp;#x200b;

**second story is a bad tourist one.** 

i was working the counter, taking orders when a large indian family came in. the mountains are very pale so it was obvious they were tourists. they took a second looking at the board before bt walked to me. 

me - *""hi what can i get for you?""*

bt - *""do you do grilled fish?""* he asked this while scouring the board as if expecting it to be hidden in some corner written in very small writing. 

*""very sorry we only offer battered fish,""* i responded, my line generic and rehearsed. 

*""okay can we please get 4 grilled fish-""* i cut them off kind of baffled, thinking he hadn't heard me. 

*""sorry, we don't make grilled fish.""*

*""oh,""* he looked down from the board and back to me with a look of annoyance, *""well we'll get four veggie burgers. are those deep fried?""* 

*""yes, they are.""*

*""we want them grilled, and the mayonnaise on the side in a container,""* he said as he looked back at the board. 

*""we can do that but if they are grilled then they will be on the same hotplate the meat is on-*"" cut off.

*""and a large coleslaw, but can you take the mayonnaise out?""* i might've been wide eyed staring at this point. all salads are pre-made, coleslaw especially was purchased pre-made. did they think we were making fresh coleslaw with every order?

*""unfortunately our coleslaw is pre-made so we can't do that.""*

*""oh,""* he stared at me like i was lighting his child on fire, *""we'll have that then.""*

*""pardon, you would like a large coleslaw as is?""*

*""with the mayonnaise on the side,""* another look as though i asked if he was part fish. 

*""we cannot take the mayonnaise out, coleslaw is pre-made.""*

*""you can't make more?""* impatience was seeping into his tone.

*""unfortunately not, would you still like a large coleslaw?""*

*""fine, yes.""*

i took payment and went to the back with my manager to cook, telling him what they asked for. he was baffled but did his best to clean a part of the grill for them to keep the veggie burgers as vegetarian as possible. we served their food, mayonnaise on the side, and left them to eat in the dining room. wonderfully enough, they left lettuce and paper lying everywhere, chairs at whatever angle they stood up from and mayonnaise containers tipped over. 

i was very glad they weren't locals because i never wanted to deal with the glares i got for refusing to separate their mayonnaise from the coleslaw again.",Rogue106,tfys
455,help with an opportunity in fine dining.,"i know this isn't necessarily the place for this but i need some help. hope y'all don't mind. 

i currently work in a mid tier restaurant in a food and wine destination in virginia. it is a great food town and there are great restaurants all over. i usually see 45-65 covers a night at my current restaurant and that allows me to make a pretty good living ( i average about $265 every night.) 

recently, i've been exploring other opportunities and have been offered a position at what i believe to be the best restaurant in town. it's a much higher end, fine dining restaurant. the downside is that in fine dining the cover count is much lower. i have a friend who works at this fine dining restaurant and he tells me servers there make about $220-250 every night. that is a fairly substantial pay decrease for me. 

i really like the idea of working at the best restaurant in town. i think it might provide me more opportunities down the road. particularly i think it might be advantageous if i want to move to a bigger city and work in fine dining. i guess i'm just curious what other people think. do you think it would be worth it to take the pay decrease in order to expand my skillset ? or should i just keep hustling and making as much as i can ? for the record i like my current job. i just don't have many opportunities to grow and expand my skillset.

457,make my server cry then demand i comp your meal? i will loudly and publicly eviscerate you.,"i just found this sub and finally have somewhere to post this story. this took place about six or seven years ago. this is a long one but is also my proudest moment from my four years in the industry.

i started working at a pretty laid back establishment (servers can wear whatever they want) as a waiter when i started college, and was promoted to manager after two years. this particular event took place on a friday night and we were pretty busy.

so this group of guys who appeared to be in their late 50's walked in and were seated after about a 20 minute wait. they were served by one of my favorite waitresses, susan. she was 17, extremely charming, polite, and funny. generally well loved by staff and customers alike. 

she took their drink orders quickly and brought them out quickly as well. after this she came up to me and said the guys seemed kinda skeevy, staring at her chest, touching her arm, making comments on how she was dressed (crop top and shorts, not the most scandalous outfit ever). i asked her if she wanted me to give them to another server, she said no cause she thought they might tip well. against my better instincts i let her keep the table.

after an hour and a half (during which she, unbeknownst to me, politely asked them to keep their hands to themselves multiple times) they flagged her down. i didn't witness what was said but she told me about it afterwards. it went something like this:

susan: is there something i can do for you guys? or would you guys like your bills now?

old fuck: oh no not quite yet we plan on having dessert and some more drinks, we've just been talking and thought you could use some advice. you really should be more flirty with your guests. frankly i found it incredibly rude when you asked us not to touch you, especially in that outfit. it's obvious that you dress like a slut and expect to get big tips based on your looks alone. you're not even that hot, you're pudgy (untrue) and your face is bland and average at best (also untrue). also you shouldn't refer to us so casually, we expect you to call us sir, or gentlemen if you're referring to all of us. if you want to get good tips you're gonna have to work a little harder for it sweetheart. now we'll be here for a bit longer so if you do good from this point forward you can expect to be tipped, understood? we'll flag you down when we're ready to order more.

she was very shaken, and turned to leave after giving a meek ""understood."" before she left one of the other guys poked her side and literally made a pig noise at her. she came over to me with tears in her eyes and relayed everything to me, and started really crying while saying it. i felt this calm, focused rage wash over me. i apologized to her, hugged her, and promised i'd go make a scene for her. she cheered up a bit at that, and stopped crying as hard. i printed out their checks and prepared myself.

now, before going to college and working here i was in the marines, and was a sgt and squad leader. i can adopt a very specific manner of speaking that comes from being in charge of about a dozen junior marines, and dealing with their dumbfuckery. it communicates a feeling of *private _______ i know that you (drunk drove, got a stripper pregnant, lost your nvgs again, asked an lt for her number, took a shit on the floor(!) of cpl klemens room, etc.) and i'm about to tear your fucking head off and shit down your neck.* ( they were excellent marines under fire, but christ were they ever difficult the rest of the time)

me: good evening *gentleman*

old fuck: excuse me *boy* i don't appreciate you interrupting our conversation, now clear these plates and send the girl back here so we can put in some more drink orders.

me: that's not why i'm here *sir*. you see i just had an *interesting* conversation with your waitress, susan. i heard you gave her some advice?

old fuck: yeah? i told her how she could be doing her job better, what about it?

me: well i have a bit of a problem with what you said to her, *sir*. i don't give a fuck what you think she could do differently, what i *do* give a fuck about is you harassing and belittling her, and making her cry. would you please explain why you felt the need to say these things to her?

old fuck: excuse me son but i don't much appreciate your tone or your language. i demand to see your manager so we can have our meals comped due to your behavior.

me: i am the manager, *sir* and i find your behavior unacceptable. first you refuse to stop touching her when she asks politely, then you get indignant about it? she is 17 and you've been sexually harassing her all evening. don't you dare lecture me on my tone. and i don't give a shit about what she's wearing, or what you think you're entitled to, your can't just touch women without their consent. 

this had the desired effect of garnering a lot of attention, and most of our very liberal patrons were staying daggers at them.

me: (slapping their bills onto the table) i'm not gonna comp shit for you creeps, now pay your fucking bills and get out! none of you are welcome back here until you learn to treat women with some goddamn respect! 

they all realized that this very large man screaming in their face meant business, paid their bills and fucking skedaddled. i immediately called the owner and explained the whole thing to him in case they complained, to which he replied ""ok.... i'm glad you stood up for her but next time just kick them out without cursing them out in front of all our guests please."" whoops.",I_AMA_spaz,tfys

ok so i work as a cook at a local bar and grill. it’s a good place and everyone’s somewhat nice the thing is the place is next to a small hotel and this leads to the place getting busy on that day it was extremely busy due to having a birthday party with a shit ton of people. there where four cooks and our boss was helping us if we started falling behind. when the party was over the place was nearly dead with only a couple of people at the bar it was getting close to closing the kitchen so we started to clean up. then we got a call and the ticket came in and everyone’s heart dropped ten 12inch pepperoni pizza’s. it was ten minutes from closing. the place i worked at has four small pizza ovens each could only hold one, but each pizza takes about 15 minutes to make. so i and the other cooks made them as quickly as possible and we had when we were done it was around 27 minutes before closing. then we started to clean up the ovens and the rest then the lady came to pick up the pizzas she got the pizzas and started looked at them and looked at the cashier “where’s the pepperoni!” the cashier didn’t know what she was talking about and came to get us went up to the front while the others continued to clean. i looked at her.
 me“what’s the matter?” she looks at me and opens the box 
lady “where the hell it the pepperoni!!”  to clear things up we put all toppings under the cheese when we make pizzas. 
me”it’s under the cheese?” she looks at the pizza and said to me “well fix it!”me “what?” she rolls her eyes “me me new ones with the pepperoni on top!” me” mam i’m sorry but i’m not sure i can do that we are closed and are cleaning up.” lady “i don’t care make me new ones or i’m not paying!”i already know that she is going to be a problem and get my manager. when she hears what’s happening she walks out and talks to the lady.m” mam like he already told you he can’t  make new pizzas since the kitchen is closed.” the lady scoffs “well i want them half off!”  my manager sighed “ i’m not doing that. the placement of the pepperoni won’t change anything so if you want pizza take the ones we made and pay the full price or leave the pizzas here.” the lady turns red “why the hell do i have to pay for this shit if your retared cooks fuck it up!!!!” my manager looked at the lady and just said “hey out.” lady”no i’m not leaving until i get my pizzas.”  manager “ leave right now before i call the police!” the lady huffs and left without the pizzas my manager and let us take the pizzas home for free.  i have no idea why she made such a big deal about this but i got a free pizza in the end.

most of our customers were fairly nice to me as i still looked very young however we occasionally did get customers who would do anything for a free drink (walking out without paying, putting broken glass in food etc) however this group were the worst i experienced 

my job was just to serve the food and drinks then ask if they wanted sauces etc as we didn’t do table service anyway this group had ordered 4 sunday roasts as well as deserts along with copious amounts of alcohol, so they got a little drunk and when i came to take their desert plates away they told that all their meals were awful and that they should be allowed a full refund 

keep in mind that they had wiped their plates clean on both courses and had racked up a large bill. i was fairly new at the time and just stuttered something about checking with the kitchen and speed walked away.

usually this would be the end of the problem however in this case the group refused to back down and even when we made it clear that we could involve the authorities they still kept insisting on a full refund or ‘at least’ drinks on the house some point they turned on me and started harassing me about some bullshit about not being good, witch at the time really scared me.

464,the story of why i quit my waitress job,"this is quite an old story, it was my first job and i had just finished school. i started a waitressing job at a cafe, the cafe was in the entrance to an animal park but you didn't need to pay entry to access the cafe so people liked to come and eat on the terrace where they could see animals from a distance. it was also a hot spot in summer for tourists and retired people to come eat. everything seemed nice at first. i had an interview and got hired instantly and asked to start the next day, weird. but i came in and the manager seemed cool, taught me how to use the coffee machines etc.

for my first 4 day week i worked the coffee bar, this was fine with me. my manager had started showing signs of being an asshole then; if we ever stood still for more than 2 minutes he would begin yelling at us to restock fridges or clean things and would constantly call me and other teenagers lazy. we had to pay for everything we ate or drank during the day unless it came from home, but other staff didn't. he began picking on me in particular here onwards.

whenever we got a drinks delivery, he would ask me to carry crates downstairs. at the time i weighed only 45kg and was an anorexic teenage girl, who could barely lift a tray of food to tables. i had at least 3 bigger men in their twenties working with me and i was singled out to carry heavy crates. i did so but had to stop on the stairs or secretly ask one of the guys for help; i say secretly because if the manager caught me asking anyone to help me he'd be furious!

i even got sat down by him to have a go at me about my hair and how it was my fault a customer found a hair in their food. (i have red hair and the hair was brown) i explained that i didn't even wait on that table and that it couldn't of been me (theres another girl who waits tables all the time and her hair isn't tied back properly) he would have none of it and wrote me up for being unprofessional when confronted with my mistake and i had to apologise to the customer directly, for someone i didn't even do.

i was also once asked to apologise to an elderly woman who said that my self harm scars offended her. (the uniform did not have a jacket and it was summer)

it was little things like this that happened daily. we would clean everything in prep for closing, be closed and someone would ask for a coffee. 'sorry madam we are closed now' and our manager would demand we make it and clean everything again. making us miss buses etc. we often worked 8-10 at night with only a lunch and no breaks and would be yelled at constantly

i remember my final straw; it was a 10 hour day. i was exhausted as i was the only person waiting tables and the cafe was packed all day. my arms were shaking because i was so tired and was struggling to get food to the tables. at one point i had to stop at another table, drop the food on their table and pick it up again to carry it to the customer (i was going to drop it because i just couldn't hold it anymore). i was due to take my lunch hours ago, and everyone else had gone for lunch; i asked when i would be able to take my lunch. my manager said there was not enough people and other people had worked longer than me and not had lunch yet (a blatant lie). i continue doing what i am doing. i get a second of respite and pour myself a glass of water, my manager sees me do this and immediately demands i bring crates into the bar from the back; i go out to collect the crates. at this point i'm angry. i walk through the kitchen out back and i slip and fall on an unmarked wet hallway floor, my ankle rolls and i cry out in agony as i hit the floor. i get up and stumble outside, furious by my day and my injury i kick a bucket into the wall of the smoking area. at this point my co-worker comes out and gives me a hug to calm me down.

i limp through the rest of service, my manager sees, says nothing. i don't get a lunch this day. my manager takes 2. i ask if i can leave a bit earlier as i am in pain. my manager says i am fine, and no. i eventually finish my day. exhausted and starving; the next day i get my ankle checked out at the doctor because it's purple and swollen. he says i have sprained it badly and advises me to stay off it for close to a week. i take one day off and am scared to call to ask for it. my manager is not happy.

i return the next day wearing white trainers (we are supposed to wear black shoes, i have black vans) because my feet can't fit in my other shoes because they are so swollen. he has a go at me, saying my shoes are not the correct uniform and i am to go home and change my shoes. i explain that my feet are so swollen they will not fit in my other shoes at that he's lucky i am in at all! i leave and catch the bus home. i do not return and ignore phone calls for the following few days until i am eventually fired.

i later found out there was an incident in which a chef burnt herself badly in the catering truck and was not allowed to go to the hospital. she now has nerve damage in her forearm as a result of the untreated burn.

edit: at one point they even started recycling the milk! when you ordered a pot of tea you would get milk on the side, a lot of the time we picked these up from tables and they still had milk in. no biggie. but one day our manager demanded that we pour the left over milk into a jug near the clearing station to be reused! i thought this was absolutely disgusting and would pour the jug away whenever i could. that also got me into a lot of trouble. but i never told the owners about it. i have no idea if they still do this as i’ve never been back there since.

&amp;#x200b;

thats the story of the worst job i have ever had. it resulted in me being anxious and afraid to go into employment and still effects me today. they also didn't pay me for the last 4 days of work i did before i quit. i worked there for just over a month and two weeks. luckily i'm in university now so i don't need to work currently and also got over my anorexia. i am 70kg and hit the gym 5 days a week

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: my manager is a horrible human being that made my life a living hell until a workplace injury made me quit my job with no notice.",Thaurer_,tfys
465,is this normal?,"i just want to preface this with the fact that this is not a typical talesfromyourserver post.

  


recently, i have started to train at a new restaurant opening in our town. i have worked as a server before, but i've never experienced the rules this new place wants to set.

  


the restaurant wants servers to keep $100 in change, so if customers need change we can directly give it to them.

  


the restaurant wants us to do a tip share with dish, hosts, and kitchen based on the total sales we do in a night. for example: if i do $500 in sales and make $10 in tips, i would owe the percentage based on the $500 in sales (not tips).

  


the restaurant wants us to travel 1 hour and 30 mins (one way) to the nearest established restaurant of the same brand. the restaurant then wants us to work a split shift with 3 hours in between shifts. they gave no indication of whether they plan to pay for our gas to travel or the additional 3 hours in between shifts.

  


is this normal? or am i not completely crazy in thinking that this is odd.",smells_like_aliens,tfys
466,did you guys suck when you started out? and how long did it take to get out of that?,"hey guys, so i'm a month into my first serving job at a busy asian restaurant in southern california, and if you haven't guessed already, i feel like i really suck at this. there are excuses i can make, and i think they're valid complaints. the place didn't train me as they said they would. they've changed their schedule over five times in the short time i've been there, often not letting me know, checking my availability, or giving me a heads up 24 hours in advance. they don't have a manager, and instead the managerial duties are split up among a few head servers who are constantly giving contradictory instructions and getting mad when they catch you doing the things you were instructed to do by the others. on top of that, the owner spends all his time screaming at people and makes working there so much more stressful than it needs to be.

but all this is besides the point, because despite it all, i'm tired of jumping from job to job. i'm resigned to the reality that i'll find reason to be unhappy anywhere. and once i'm making full tips, i should be able to make around $800 to $1000 in a 25-30 hour week, which seems pretty good, right?

anyways, back to my main issue... i feel like i really suck at this. my first couple of weeks were rough. i got screamed at almost every shift, getting sent home early a couple times. i messed up a couple orders, made mistakes on the pos, and once, a table even requested that i get another server for them. it's getting a bit better. i know the menu pretty well now. i don't make pos mistakes. i got the hang of organizing my notes so i don't forget to bring things out. and i'm finally able to carry four plates at a time. but i'm still so goddamn slow and am rarely able juggle 6 tables at a time without leaving 1 table frustrated with the wait, often because there's so much other stuff going on at the same time, like other servers asking me to get their drinks, set up their tables, etc.  i'm glad i'm not getting screamed at every shift anymore, but i still feel like the other servers don't think i'm pulling my weight.

467,in one word? flabbergasted,"hi, sorry in advance for the rant but i'm really really struggling today. i have worked at the same place for about two years, full time, and generally liked it and thought i was doing a good job there. my customers like me, i'm a strong server. i stay late when people leave and don't do sidework. anyways i went in tonight only to be told i had been cut from 5 shifts to 2 and to go home. the reason? it seems like i don't want to work because i took 3 days off last month. when i had bronchitis, and a doctor's note and got the shifts covered. i'm beyond devestated right now and scared, i rely on this job to live. all i can think is that it's because i made kind of a big deal when our paychecks were short 2 weeks in january. i can't stop crying, i literally have never had something like this happen in ten years of serving. i have to find a job asap meaning it's probably back to a chain for now. sorry for the rambling rant, i just don't know where else to vent to.

470,15 people when we are full shure no problem,"hello i recently joined redit but have been a fan of the story's for a while and when i saw this page i knew i had to post.

to set the scene i work at applebees as an sa (the person that greats and seats you) and this was right after a high school basketball game during late night so needless to say we where full. so i was doing my job seating people when a group of five come in and that's where the story starts.

me - you all ready know
trish - one of the group
vicky - the poor waitress that had to serve them
kat - sa 2
em - sa 3
(we usually have 3 or 4 sa's on fridays)

me ""how many tonight?"" 
trish ""15 and we would like to sit over there"" (points to the bussyest section)
me and kat look at each other for a second and then proceed 
kat ""that will be a thirty minute wait""
trish ""okay"" the group sits and waits for a couple minutes and more of them come bringing there total to ten people

me and kat plan to put a six top and a four top together and split the rest to a near by both that fits six

kat ""would it be okay if we split up the group?""
trish ""yes it would"" 

the people leave from the tables we are going to put together so we bus, wipe and put them together makeing shure viky knows she is getting a 15 top (she was not happy) we place the menues at the tables and both and seat them. after a while volt comes to take there orders (all apps and mostly water) she finds out it will only be ten now so she brings us all the menues and we re wipe the booth. (fast forward to them paying) they spilt the bill and tip a whole seven dollars and leave (vicky was mad they didn't even tip for every person)

tldr a group comes in say 15 ends up being ten waisting other peoples time who are waiting for something to open up and under tip

471,"man, this lady has tried my patience...","i have served her twice now. the first time she was with two other women and she ordered pesto pasta. her dish comes to the table exactly as she ordered it. she's stops me in the middle of being double-sat to ask me ""where are the whole pine nuts?"" i begin to politely explain that the pine nuts are blended into the sauce when she interrupts me. ""i know how pesto is made, it always has whole pine nuts. there is supposed to be whole pine nuts.""

this is where i messed up. i had to get to my other tables and i didn't have time to go back and forth with her at that moment and honestly she was starting to annoy me. so i said ""well, everybody makes it differently."" i was well meaning when i said it. i take things people say very literally, so i genuinely thought the issue was that this lady wanted to argue the semantics of pesto. so me saying that was basically my agree to disagree. i fully intended to check back with her to see how she liked it once she tried it. 
well. the next time i head over to check on them she starts this speech that went something to the effect of...

""i know for a fact that your pesto has always had whole pine nuts (never has there been whole pine nuts, checked with the chef) because i've been a regular here for years. i am so absolutely disgusted by how you just dismissed me that i can't bring myself to finish my meal *pushes the plate away from her* i own two restaurants myself and you would not last long working for me if you think it is acceptable to treat people this way.""

i was caught off guard by the intense dramatics and i was deeply embarrassed because my whole section is now looking over at the scene. i genuinely start apologizing and trying to explain how i meant no offense to her but she's not hearing it. in fact, me being powerless only emboldened her bitchyness. 
i can't remember all what she said to me, i just remember her ending again with ""i can't even eat this."" again, i take things very literally, so i ask her if she needs a box. she says yes and i grab her one. i send my manager over to her and of course he gives her free stuff, customer is always right blah blah (not his fault, he's a great manager). he wasn't upset with me though, just asks me why i didn't just offer her some pine nuts or something. i'm like, ""cause i didn't know that's what she wanted!"" 

i think what upset me the most is that people like her get away with treating people like this and never learn that they are an asshole. i think at the end of the day she was just embarrassed that she didn't know what pesto was and took it out on me so she wouldn't look stupid in front of her shitty friends. i feel so bad for the servers that work in her restaurants. she must be a nightmare.

the only thing that snapped me out of my funk was this guy i got a to-go order ready for made a point to say he thought ""i was great"" right near her table. 

bonus story:
she came in for lunch yesterday and ordered the mahi mahi special. i almost didn't know it was the same woman because she was on her best behavior (i think she was on a date), but her crazy eyes gave her away. she of course said the fish was too dry and that it was fine (tried the fish she put to the side when i bussed the table and it was cooked to perfection and succulent), but after i insisted that there must be something we can do for her she opted to replace the fish with fried chicken. the chicken was comped but other than that everything was fine. she did stare at me a lot when i was at my other tables tho... my favorite part was that a man sitting at the bar in front of her booth ordered the special as well. when i asked him how it was and he exclaimed loudly ""amazing, cooked to perfection!"" i can't help but think that was a dig at her...

tonight easily should have been the shift from hell. 

6 hours before her shift, my server called in sick. due to abnormal amount of books offs for march break i was already schedules to close kitchen while on duty as a manager. server was also supposed to close serve and help in kitchen (also paid as a manager), despite best efforts  i could not get it covered. i had staff on willing to stay a bit later then shifted but being part timers could not close. no big deal, if i'm here late, it is what it is. 

shift my ass into high gear as tables start pouring in. 2-3 at a time. anywhere from 2-8 people at a time. i explained any issues in wait time due to being short staffed and all my customers were wonderful about it. my staff to there credit did amazing (and plan to use the recognition board later this week to show them appreciation plus i'm thinking tim's /mcdonald's gift cards).

2 hours before closing all my staff have to leave, left me without dishes to do (thank god), and my last tables of the night seeing i was by myself tipped generously. having to week basically three positions (cook/server/manager) should have been way more stressful than it was tonight, and thanks to amazing customers (who i doubt are on reddit but any customer whose seen this, know your patience and generosity is overwhelmingly appreciated) and staff kicking ass, i did not want to rip my hair out and scream. i even managed to get out before midnight :)",DarthRen87,tfys
478,customer is mad about the cranberry muffins having “cherries” in them,"i work at a coffee shop that sells muffins and various pastries as well as coffee drinks. one of our most popular muffins is the cranberry orange. it is just frozen pilsberry batter that we bake every day. it’s orangey batter filled with big, juicy, fresh cranberries. i’ve been selling and eating this exact muffin for almost four years now. 
today a lady comes through the drive thru and ordered only two cranberry orange muffins. after warming them, bagging them, and telling her the price, she says “i came here yesterday, paid for the muffins, and got all the way home before i noticed y’all gave me cherry instead of cranberry!” 
this was an immediate red flag because i know for a fact that we have never had cherry muffins. we have nothing with cherries at all, neither do any of our other locations. there are no cherries in the whole store and no cherry muffins on the list of available products to order wholesale.
i tell her politely “i’m so sorry about that, maybe someone accidentally grabbed blueberry? we don’t actually sell cherry muffins”
she looks me dead in the eye and says “oooh yes you do”
i was confused and started to laugh a bit.  i told her i wasn’t sure what had happened since that’s the only cranberry muffin we’ve ever had. 
she says “ooooh no it’s not” in the same time, like she was catching a child in a lie or something.
so then i said “let me show you these muffins, because i can guarantee these are the same as yesterday and i’m worried this isnt want you want”
i show her he muffin and she says “that’s the cherry one, i do not want cherries, i ordered cranberry orange”
i tell her this is in fact cranberry. she says simply, “no it is not”
i assure her i’ve read the ingredient list and sold/eaten these muffins for years, i promise they are cranberries. i kinda break one of the berries out of the muffin and show her up close. she says “that is not a cranberry, that’s a cherry”
then she goes on to tell me that she i will be calling the owner to let him know that we are false advertising 😂 and that it is wrong to put cranberries on the label if it’s really cherries. 
this goes on for a while and other customers are waiting so i politely ask if she’d like the muffins after all. she scoughs and says “of course not, i do not like cherrries, i’ll go to another location”

she left and i can only imagine her frustration when she gets to another store and finds that all their  cranberries have magically turned to cherries too!

it wasn’t until a few hours later that i realized the problem: she must’ve never seen a fresh cranberry before. dried ones look pretty different (grapes v raisins) so my guess is that this lady was just only familiar with dried cranberries. but what i’ll never understand, is why does she think we would lie about this? what benefit to the business would it be to sneak cherries into peoples muffins and then pretend they were cranberries. why why why?

tldr: customer won’t believe me that the cranberry muffins are not actually cherry muffins because she’s never seen a fresh cranberry before. ",uniqueusernamei,tfys

481,serving 30 tables alone - 1/10 won't recommend,"some backstory and context:

i've worked as a waiter at a pizza chain for about 6-7 years next to college, so i'm an experienced waiter. the restaurant has three floors with 20-30 tables for each floor (the floors vary in size). 

1st floor: restaurant only

2nd floor: restaurant and kitchen (we use lifts to send the food in-between the floors)

3rd floor - restaurant and meeting room

we use walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.

our tasks as waiters includes taking orders, make the drinks, deliver the drinks, deliver the food, clean the tables, do the dishes and make desserts and a few appetizers.

this was the night of a big event, and i work on the 3rd floor.

story:

my boss called me and asked if i could take a reservation of 50, as one of my co-workers had called in sick. i was low on funds, so i thought why not. i was supposed to only serve the reservation and no one else.

the reservation of 50 arrives (all exhausted from walking up the stairs), order their drinks, order their food and have a great time! they eventually finish eating and would like to order more drinks, which is not an issue. as i take their order i notice a family walking in on the 3rd floor and find themselves a seat (it's pretty common to sit down yourself here, since you've already been welcomed by the host on the 1st floor). 

i didn't think much about it and thought ""oh well, the other floors are probably full, i can do a few more tables"". but oh was i wrong.

as i served the reservation their drinks, i noticed another family coming in. i went over to the previous family, took their order and punched it through the system. all of a sudden three families of 8 enter the floor, which means i now serve 82 people alone. i'm starting to get a bit stressed, but i don't worry too much about it as i just give them time to read their menus.

again, all of a sudden there's a line of people waiting to be seated, which added up to 6 new tables. i am now serving 11 tables, which adds up to 100+ people.

i decide to tell the host through the walkie-talkie that i can't take anymore tables at the moment. the message was never received.

fast forward 30 minutes and i was alone serving 30 tables. this adds up to 200-250+ people, with both kids, parents, elderly and young people. tables that takes their time to order and demands that i stand there with them through the whole process, people with complicated orders, and customers complaining about slow service.

i was never able to get down to the 1st floor to tell the host that i could not do anymore tables. somehow i barely managed to serve the entire floor, but i cracked down crying at the end when everybody left because i was exhausted.

i told my boss and we have made sure this will never happen again. 1/10 won't recommend.",glennorini,tfys

484,the hot tempered manager,"a few years ago, i worked at a fast food restaurant that we'll call square burgers. it was then i worked for about two years when a nightmare of a manager was assigned to work there. some shift managers were cool and lost their cool for a moment due to stressful moments. the general manager was the sweetest person you'd ever meet. but, there was one manager from hell that we'll call m. 
m was so hot tempered and immature that he would lose his mind over the smallest things. m was a very angry person. i think his soul was powered by hatred and despair. i normally was the grill operate and it was my responsibility to make sure that food was cooking and that food didn't overcook and burn. when the fries were done cooking, the fry alarm would sound off and if anyone wasn't able to remove them from the fryer, i had to do it. i would basically run the restaurant better than anyone else when it came to cooking. m would flip out if i turned off the alarm even when there wasn't any product in the fryer. he would just let it ring and ring. i worked the register when m didn't feel like it, so he worked on the grill station.
one day i was assigned as the cashier and the cash register bugged out on me at the worst possible time.

me: i need a manager. m, i keep trying to add a four piece nugget to the four dollar meal deal but it keeps removing the meal deal all together and just has the nuggets instead.

m: shut the f**k up! you are so annoying, go to the back! (he said this in front of many customers waiting to place their order. the line was so long it was halfway across the dining room. i went to the back of the kitchen upset. i sat in the break room and started to cry.)

m: where the f**k is he? he's f**king useless! go home g!

me: i have to sign out from my register....

m: gtfo now! i'm tired of seeing your face! 

i then leave the restaurant and threw my hat and name tag on the ground. i walked over to my aunts house sobbing and she was shocked to find out what happened. she then calls my uncle and tells him what happened and he said he'd start a scene (made me chuckle). she then had me call hr and report what happened. hr then took the situation to the district manager who then called me wanting to know what happened. he felt terrible about what happened and wanted to see if m and i could settle out our dispute but i reject his offer. he asked me if i wanted to work there again and i rejected his offer. he said i wasn't fired, but m thinks otherwise. when the next pay period arrives, the general manager was there and gave me my last paycheck, covered in tears. she asked me if i wanted to come back and i kindly rejected her offer. the district  and general manager wanted to hire me back because i was one of the best and helped with good customer service. i didn't want to work with m, the toxic shift manager who didn't get penalized for what he did. i was the only grill operate they had for day shift when a manager wasn't cooking. now instead of flipping out, m could flip burgers to his hearts content.

485,please don't touch your server!,"this has happened way too many times by various customers to count. 

i have been poked, rubbed, grabbed by the arm, grabbed from behind, etc. i don't need my shoulder touched to hear you any better. i don't need any physical contact at all when doing my job! it makes me very uncomfortable. not to mention when i tell a customer to please not touch me they seem to get offended. it isn't a hard concept to understand!

and now that i'm now 27 weeks pregnant and starting to show i have lots of people at work trying all the time to rub my belly without asking. that is not okay.

486,aggressively confronted by substance using kitchen worker but was innocent?,"i work at a family owned restaurant and personally know the owner who i grew up with which makes the job a lot more fun. many of the employees don’t speak fluent english while some speak a little. im a server who often engages in small talk with a hispanic kitchen worker that is very high energy, outgoing, and quite the jokester but is know to abuse some substances such as alcohol and cocaine. he has been scolded by one of the owners for reeking of alcohol which i walked into one day and quickly did my business then left as they continued the conversation. 

recently i was joking around with this co worker and two others that didn’t speak fluent english as they offered to make me food at the end of the night which i happily obliged. my hispanic co worker jokingly offered me a large dish as i was in the kitchen where the other two co workers said “give at close!” where we laughed and i set it next to the food station where my hispanic co workers own to go dish was. not much later i went back into the kitchen for something and was confronted by this co worker demanding to know where his dish went, i thought he was joking and laughed while saying i had no idea, he proceeded to get into my face aggressively and talked some trash saying i took it then tossed my box of food into the trash. still confused i grabbed the dish and handed to one of the other co workers who was asking for it to add some items to it as the hispanic co worker continued to curse at me. 

i went and discussed what had happened to my friend the owner and was shocked when he said “yeah he’s done that before, even to me.” i thought to myself, what the fuck? my friend said that he apparently does it due to his substance abuse which he “guessed,” could be cocaine, alcohol, or meth. i asked why he would keep a guy that would confront the owner of the restaurant in such a manner and he said that he just hadn’t gotten around to hiring a new guy but that he would like to replace him. 

at the end of the night as my hispanic co worker came to get his tip i looked him in the eyes and asked “were you serious?” just to see his reaction, he giggled and said something unintelligible but seemingly non aggressive and i just shrugged then left the conversation abruptly and ignored him the remainder of the shift. 

now i’m wondering what the future of my employment will be like having to deal with such a toxic co worker? he obviously has a substance problem that is known by the owners and i experienced it first hand, the worst part is that he’s done it before and is still working there. he’s either hard to replace or the owners lack the ability to let him go i feel. do i ignore this guy every time i see him? i don’t want to give someone my positive energy who will, at a moments notice, flip on me.

487,tifu with a corporate manager,"on mobile. need to vent. thank you for your tolerance. 

this feels like a cinematic face palm moment. 

walking back to the server station, chef is talking to someone i didn’t bother to look who. 

they are standing arms crossed leaning against the soda station. it’s a small station. 

i grab ice from around them then say, “not the best place to be standing.” dude turns his head to me and it’s the regional manager. poop. 

he throws eye daggers and says, “you could have said something.” to which i bit back my response (“i did.”) and he goes back to talking with the chef and i grab my drinks. nothing else said.

i avoided him the rest of the shift.

defensively i feel i wasn’t wrong, it wasn’t completely rude, and had he been anyone else it would have been a snarky joke. i also know he loves his butt kissed and it was slightly more crass than a simple “excuse me.” defensiveness says “nah, excuse them! they were making a power stance moves and getting in the way of their own business!” 

honestly i wouldn’t have said that if i knew it was him, but would have to anyone else; that sounds morally jaded. but what i did also has me feeling like i challenged a bull. in the end, i had no idea it was him and made an ass of myself. pitiful. 

i’m almost a year into serving. this is the most egg on my face yet. same corporate manager will be there all day tomorrow and so will i. 

should i just succumb and kiss corporate ass or should corporate tools be treated the same as everyone who works under them? 

i’m so dreadfully anxious for my shift tomorrow now! is there a cure to the nerves or situation? until then i feel like it’s a never ending cringe moment. ",uke_yell,tfys
488,this insane guy punched his sandwich,"disclaimer: i'm very aware that it's frustrating when food orders are made wrong but some people are freaking crazy

ok, so i work at a common fast for place, and one day this guy came in, he ordered his food, the normal. now, this guy looked a little rough around the edges, but that's pretty normal for my city. i live in a smaller city where alot of people are honestly kind of sketchy, so this was fairly normal. plus, i don't judge by looks. anyway

so he sits down, and we bring him his food. this is where things go off the rails.

the man opens his sandwich, takes a bite, and finds it has been made wrong. instead of being a normal human and asking to have it remade, the man stands up punches the sandwich. full force.

after this outburst during a busy time of day, the man expects to stay there and still eat.

my boss politely asks him to leave more than once, and the man refuses. my boss calls the police, who force the man to leave and the man is now banned from our restaurant.

489,waited on my rapist and cried for a solid two hours at work,"this happened about a week ago and i still wanna die from fear/embarrassment. i'm on mobile so sorry for strange formating.

i live in a fairly small town (around 700 people) so it wouldn't be ridiculous to guess i've seen almost everyone in town at the restaurant i work at. i started working there when i was 14 and worked as a hostess there for two years and almost a year as a waitress. it's not bad money, were always busy with tourists and regulars, so i'm fairly happy with it.

for a bit of background, i was raped as a seven year old. once i was 14 i tried to speak up about it but i couldn't get anyone to believe me, so no legal action was taken.

it's the middle of lunch rush and we have a small like out the door. five minutes wait time to be seated, a 45 minute wait for food. its smooth sailing for me so far, since i'm pretty used to it at this point, until my rapist (r) walks in. i immediately recognize him, and i'm shaking. trying to calm myself down, i put him down on the waiting list and immediately run to the back.

after a few deep breaths i convince myself i can handle it and go back out to the floor. my manager has already gotten him coffee and he looks ready to order.

me: hello! are you ready to order?

r: yeah, i'll have (breakfast item.) by the way, how old are you kiddo?

me: i'm 16, sir.

r: you have way too sexy of a body to be 16. call me in a couple of years when you're legal.

that already freaked me out, so i try to leave and go put in the order and ask the head waitress (hw) to deliever his food for me. on my way out he smacks my ass, which sent me into tears.

i tell hw that i need to go to the back and to watch my food for me. i bawl my eyes out for five minutes in the bathroom, then start working again teary eyed.

hw handled r for me until he left (no, he didn't tip.) the next hour of the shift was a complete mess. i was mixing up orders, holding tickets, and almost crying the entire time. i'm pretty sure i got some pity tips from customers that saw me cry. i was so upset and distracted that i got sent home early since i was in no condition to be working. i later explained the situation to my boss who, thankfully, understood and forgave me. i'm just hoping that i never have to wait on r ever again.

tl;dr: my childhood rapist made sexual advances on me at work, causing me to bawl my eyes out and mess up a bunch of orders.

490,yelled at by a customer/employee for no apparent reason??,"so i was at work the other day, and i was up front bagging up food (i work at a common fast food place). while i was up there, a coworker took someone's order. she finishes ordering, walks away, and sits down. pretty normal. not 5 minutes later, the woman is standing at the counter looking aggravated and mumbling to herself. my co-worker and i ask what's going on, and with no prior explanation, she says ""omg you guys so f***ing ignorant and stupid. my money is missing.""-she spelled out every syllable like people do when they're angry and think your stupid. i told her(keep in mind, i'm somewhat acquainted with this woman. not very well, but somewhat), that ""treating people like a piece of crap isn't a way to get what you want."" she keeps running her mouth about how her money is gone and someone stole it (it was $5). so when i said ""no one stole your money,"" she started yelling at me, like actually yelling at me in mcdonald's, saying i called her and her daughter a liar and that i have an attitude (to be fair, i had a little bit of an attitude cuz she was treating us like garbage and she knew both of us). when someone heard her yelling, they felt bad and gave her $5 out of their own pocket. 

the kicker?

this woman is an employee
we've worked together multiple times, and she knows all of us, and this still happened. i work with her husband on a regular basis as well, and i'm honestly half expecting to be cussed out by one or both of them cuz she is the type to make crap up. the manager on duty (very reasonably) decided he needed to smoke a cigarette, but it was all over and fine after that. however, i'm not looking forward to working with her again.

492,customer that i helped once wants me on his wedding day.,"4 years ago i worked as a server in a small cafe and there was a customer that always came late with a laptop, played skyrim, fallout new vegas and time to time league of legends. he was about 20 years old, always orders a pot of tea and apple hookah (it was a hookah cafe). he always left the small change (tipping is not a habit in my country.)

our cafe had small rooms on the second floor and time to time our owner would allow people to bring bottles of alcohol which is illegal but he really didn't care that much. we never had more than 1 server at that shop as we weren't serving complex dishes (we only served gözleme, panini, and mantı) so the owner was preparing the dishes. one day in may 2015, around 6 pm, he came with a girl with a bottle of tequila, a lemon, salt and wanted one of these rooms.

the problem is the owner usually lets his friends to these rooms and would not be happy if he sees two drunk teens on the cafe. the cafe was almost empty and he would probably catch the guy so i called my friends to come to the cafe and order hookah and tea all night while working. i also told the guy to call some friends too.

the plan was to keep the cafe full so the owner would be busy and wouldn't catch them. my friends also called their friends and a half an hour later the shop was full, they were safe. they left 3 hours later and he gave me 20, which was more than their receipt and thanked me. 

last month i got a call from that guy, apparently he was marrying the girl he came with. he found the phone of the owner from the new owner (i left the place when it was sold) and called me to their wedding. i wasn't able to attend the wedding but we will meet when i came back to my town one day.",PardonerOfSalem,tfys
493,what should i do about a co-worker who doesn’t like me?,"i’ve been serving at this restaurant for about two months now and i get along with just about everyone there except for this one girl. i haven’t done anything to receive bad treatment from her, but she always ignores me/gives me dagger eyes when i’m on the floor (she’s a bartender so she rarely leaves behind the bar) or i’ll try and make friendly conversation with her and she will give me the most sarcastic replies. for example last week i brought a red bull with me to work, and when i went to drink it she said “ugh i hate red bull.” and so i made a joke about it being monday and that because of that i needed more energy than usual. her reply? “woooow how interesting” in complete monotone, while not making eye contact with me, and then just walking away. the only times that she makes conversation with me is to boast about how much money she made during her shift, without me asking her (i find it unclassy to talk about how much money you make in tips.) 

she’s not like this with everyone, it’s literally only me. she’s friends with the managers (hangs out with them outside of work and all) as well as the other servers and will talk talk talk to them all shift, but will literally ignore me the entire time; when i’ve tried to make conversation with her she’ll say something rude (like the example above) and just ignore me. i’m concerned because the other managers have lately begun talking down to me as well, and the other servers have begun to be a bit distant towards me, and the last few weeks my hours have been significantly cut. i wonder if she’s been spreading rumors about me (i’ve overheard her talk about other people behind their backs so i wouldn’t put it past her.)

494,husband doesn’t let his wife tip me?,"(not sure if this is the right sub, but it involves tipping and the service industry)
so for context, i work as a bartender in a busy pub. in my country, tipping at the bar is really uncommon in most places - but in my city, it’s a thing. it’s normal to get around 20p on a pint, or a pound or two on a round. it’s not a lot of money, but it’s a nice appreciative gesture and helps motivate me to give good service. 

enter our customers: group of about 8, middle aged, faces like slapped arses. i go over and serve them, which is quite a feat in itself as they have no idea what they want, order their drinks one at a time, and don’t respond to any of my small talk. no problem, i’m in a good mood and keep a smile on regardless, suggesting drinks to them and not rushing their order - despite people queuing up behind them. 

when it comes to pay, one of the women in the group takes out the cash and hands it to her husband (i’m assuming) who gives it to me. she then holds out an extra pound coin, which i go to take and am about to thank her when her husband physically pushes her hand away. they then leave. i’m a little miffed about getting a tip offered to me then taken away, but it also made me feel sorry for the woman who clearly wasn’t allowed to do what she wanted with her own money.

495,i want to exchange my cake!,"i'll try to keep this short. my mother owns a cake shop and i'm always helping her when i'm away from university. this time i was a server behind the cake counter.


this lady comes in and says that she won't wait in line because she had already reserved her cake the day before. we tell her that she would need to wait because there were three clients that arrived before her. she was kind of pissed, said out loud:""that's an absurd!"" but we're used to impatient costumers. mind you, she had to wait less than five minutes for service. she provides her name and her phone number so we could give the cake to her, she pays and walks out.


one hour later she arrives, place's half an hour away from closing so not many people inside the shop. she shouts ""i want to exchange my cake!"". i very happily ask her ""is there anything wrong with your cake?"". she says that her friend's son was allergic to peanuts, so she couldn't have that cake.


look, if there's something wrong with a cake e.g. hygienic problems, crumbly batter etc, we apologise and very happily give another cake of choice (any flavour of the shop) to the person. but that wasn't the case. she brought a perfect cake that happened to not be ideal for her situation. she was informed that her cake contained peanuts before buying it. she angrily shouted that we hadn't made it clear. for fuck's sake! the cake's name is ""doce de leite e amendoim"", ""amendoim"" is literally portuguese for ""peanut"".


i reply ""i can't exchange your cake. as soon it leaves the counter, i have no way to control what goes into the cake"". the lady was furious and told us that her husband is an attorney and that she knows the ""law"". i replied that i legally couldn't and that even if i did, i wouldn't and asked her if she would like to buy a cake that's been to somebody else's house. she left with the cake and wrote a very negative review on the shop.

496,well i just got fired,"i had a bad feeling today before work, i knew i should have called in. i’m honesty mortified and want to cry. 

we have a special tonight on burgers, so every table was ordering burgers and we suddenly got busy. there were only 2 servers working so we were freaking out. 

while i was taking care of a table, someone ran my food but ran the wrong food to 3 of my tables. i tried explaining to the bartender and manager, this isn’t the right food, and he got really angry and said it was my fault and that i did something wrong. 

the manger decided to run food that had been to another table to my table himself, they noticed, and when he got back to the back he freaked out, threw a plate at the ground, and fired me. 

it was in front of the entire kitchen so i was mortified. then when i went to check on my tables and apologize, one table didn’t get one plate at all and told me to cancel it, and that they wanted to speak to the manager. 

he ended up voiding two tables food, and i have to pay for all of it. 

one of the tables this happened to pulled me to the side, gave me 20$, hugged me, and told me it’s not my fault. i had to choke away tears at that moment to not cry. i finished closing all my stuff, cleaned what i could, and i’m so defeated. 

it kills me because i know it’s not my fault that the wrong food was ran, but i will take responsibility for the missing meal. in the crazy i didn’t check on my table and i should have. 

afterwords we went over the ticket and nothing i put in the pos was wrong. the wrong food was ran, and some of the wrong burgers were made. what makes me even more angry is my manager was the one who went over my ticket and approved for it to be ran. 

working at this restaurant was awful, i’m glad i don’t have to work there anymore, but i hate that i was fired for something like this. 

i was never late, if i made a mistake i always immediately told a manager and owned up to it, i busted my ass cleaning to show i wanted to be there and took my job seriously, and i never got into arguments with anyone, never back talked, never walked out, and tried really really hard because i want to do a good job. 

the place is super disorganized. they have servers washing dishes, hosting, expoing, and running bar drinks. when we were busy, especially tonight, two servers can’t handle doing all of that on top of taking care of 5 or more tables. 

i’m just so frustrated. i’m thankful for my coworkers who checked on my afterwords because it was awful finishing up my job knowing everyone knew i had just been fired. 

i’m going to go take that 20$ tip, because that’s all i have left after paying for those meals, and buy myself some pity snacks. ",littlemybb,tfys

498,without question the most embarrassing moment of my serving career. let us cry together.,"this is hands down the most mortifying thing that has ever happened to me. this is one of those incidents where you're laying in bed all comfy and suddenly the memory creeps in and you cover your eyes with your hands and whisper ""fuuuuuuuuck why"" because thinking about it *physically hurts*.

several years ago, i used to work as a banquet server at a huge convention center with my best friend. 1/10 would not recommend for a plethora of reasons. one of the only perks was you didn't have to worry about conversing with the customers as you would in your average restaurant, you'd just set down/clear plates and remain ""invisible"" and out of the way. because it was a large convention center and not a banquet hall, we would typically work events for hundreds-thousands of people.

this particular event was a formal women's fashion show with a multiple-course meal during the show. the room was set up with the cat-walk in the middle and the tables clustered around it on both sides, like [this](https://imgur.com/a/bgugral) (ignore my awful mspaint skills). i remember noticing that the table set-up looked really off. they were abnormally close to one another which created way too much empty space in the back/sides of the hall. i figured it was like that for a reason and shrugged it off. myself and the other banquet servers each had our own section of 5-6 tables that we were to serve/tend to throughout the show. we were to bring out salads, clear the plates, main course, clear the plates, and dessert. after the guests had arrived and the fashion show began, we were cued to start serving the salads. with women now sitting in the seats, the already-too-close-together tables became obnoxiously difficult to maneuver around, especially when you're trying to appear poised and out of the way.

despite the stupid table arrangements, the majority of the meal went well. and then it was time for dessert. the dessert for this meal was essentially a strawberry shortcake served in a martini glass (like [this](https://imgur.com/a/rhvcbny)). we would neatly place 6 on a drink tray, hold the tray with our left hand, and use the right hand for placing them in front of customers (fine dining has strict rules for which hands you use for what). i grow slightly flustered because (as i'm sure many of you understand) carrying a drink tray of martini glasses is *the worst*, especially when you have no room to walk.

i walk up between two of my tables with my martini-glass-dessert-tray balancing in my left hand to begin serving my guests. i'm standing in place right behind the woman i am intending to serve as i go to grab one of the desserts when, fucking suddenly, a woman sitting directly behind me goes to stand up, and in the process, launches her fucking chair out into what she believes would be the walk way but is actually the. back. of. my. god. damn. leg, completely propelling my entire body forward. you know what else was shoved forward by the force of this lady blasting off out of her seat? the mother. fucking. tray. of. martini. glass. strawberry. shortcakes. it was like slow motion. there was nothing i could do but helplessly watch as this tray of 6 cakes, individually swimming in a pond of strawberry syrup and whip cream, tumble off my tray, clanking and crashing as they land *perfectly down this woman's back*, almost as if that's where i was aiming. her white. *white*. **white fucking dress**. completely splattered with sticky red strawberry goo syrup all down her back. she gasps and turns towards me to get a good look at the dumb asshole that just showered her in 6 desserts (henlo it me). and like a fucking movie, the entire side of the room turns and gasps like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5eadhcvnju). and then silence. \[i am actually sweating rn fuck\]. you could hear a mouse fart. and in that silence, my adrenaline kicked in. my entire body temperature jumped 15 degrees and i began trembling. for all of you adrenaline junkies, no need to waste money skydiving when you can drop a tray of fucking blood red syrupy desserts down a woman's back as if you're recreating the ending to the stephen king classic, carrie, and get the same adrenaline rush. i make eye contact with the woman, it is clear i am dead inside. i slowly look up and dart my eyes across the room and realize every woman in the vicinity is gawking at me and my stupid failure of a mess. i look back down and in my utter fucking mortification, my *first instinct* was to reach my stupid piece of shit trembling hand down and grab the pound cake that had landed perfectly wedged between her butt cheeks. i grabbed it like ""oh, here ya go heh heh heh looks like you dropped this"" and actually *held it out for her to grab from me bare-handed*. i could not recreate the look this woman gave me in response if i tried. i stuttered out a ""s..s...sorr...sorry"" and placed the obviously rejected pound cake on my tray and i noped the fuck out of that room so hard. as soon as i walked out of those doors, i cried. hoooly shit did i cry.   


my best friend volunteered to take over my section of tables for the rest of the meal (which was essentially over, anyways) and i did not enter that room again until the event was over and the guests had left. according to my manager, who was actually super cool about it, when she gave the woman our business card and explained we'd cover the dry-cleaning bill, the woman was really understanding. unfortunately, that only made me feel slightly less like dying.  


never in my life, before or after this happened, have i felt such a deep, burning embarrassment. it's been years and i can't even write about it without my blood pressure spiking. just. ugh.

so one day, we're working as usual and i happen to look up at some point cause something caught my eye. i don't scare easily and this one kinda made me jump a bit. a snake had made it's way up the plants along the patio and up into the rafters above the tables. the movement i saw was the snake darting to catch a bird. so... during full service with a patio that had roughly 30-40 tables and roughly half of them were full, there was a snake dangling off the rafter while swallowing a bird. 

i told my manager and she honestly thought i was just fucking with her until i showed her. she immediately saw what i was talking about and told the entire staff that if anyone looks up and draws attention to the snake that there will be consequences. she casually went to the tables underneath the snake and offered them free drinks to relocate because we needed to ""clean that section"". so the diners underneath the snake were cleared and business proceeded as usual with her pretending to clean some stuff and keep an eye on the situation. none of the guests ever noticed and the snake disappeared after it ate the bird. enjoy your spring patio dining austin!

this place attracted a lot of older people and middle class families. one night, i was sat with a four or five top family. they seemed very pleasant and i was having a pretty good night, staying on top of everything. i get their drink order out to them and began to take the order. when i finish taking the order, the mom in the group said, ""you seem like a nice girl. my son is single. why don't you give him your number?"" (or something to that effect). now, this son could not have been any older than 16, and i was 20. he was soooooo embarrassed. the poor kid was beet red. i tried to laugh it off and said something about how i wasn't really looking for anything, then put in their order. when i got back to them, the mom pressed further. she said, ""yeah! give him your number. go ahead. or \*insert son's name\*, you give her your number!"" the son was squirming and said, ""mom, no!"" in a small voice. again, i tried to laugh it off and ignore as best as i could. 

now, i may have just been imagining things based on what happened, or it could have been unrelated to me, but i swear she seemed mad the rest of the night. not that she was mean to me in any way, but she was quiet, and didn't seem too friendly afterwards like she was in the beginning, and i wonder if it was because i didn't give her son my number. i gave them excellent service so there should have been no other reason for her to be less friendly with me. i am not sure. i wonder how many times that kid had been embarrassed in that way by his mom. if my mom had ever done anything like that i would have just died.",SnazzyMcJazzy,tfys

i heard at some establishments, even at some corporate ones (you know which ones), you have to agree that sexual harassment is part of the job. they make you sign the paper.

i'm not sure if this is legal or not.

how do some restaursnts get away with what they do? are they not actually classified as restaurants?",dnltpbke,tfys
503,drunk kids,"this happened about 5 years ago when i was a server at a local brewery. 

about 20 kids, 8-10 years old, and about 10 of their parents came in after the kids had a soccer game on a saturday afternoon. it was a busy day and i had about 7 other tables because we were understaffed and breweries with patios get crazy on warm saturdays. 

this group of kids all wanted our homemade root beer, so i suggested to their parents, who were sitting at separate tables from the kids, that they get some pitchers of root beer, since we have it on tap and i didn’t want to spend the next hour refilling a bunch of kids sodas. 

so i pick up 4 pitchers of root beer from the servers station at the bar and drop them off to the kids, along with 20 frosted glasses. all good, they have their appetizers already, so i have about 10 minutes to not worry about this group and focus on my other tables. 

i come back 10 minutes later to check on the kids table and they say the root beer “tastes weird.” i was about to dismiss the complaint but then something occurred to me and my stomach sunk and my eyes went wide as dinner plates. i inspect the pitchers more carefully and turns out... i served a bunch of children 2 pitchers of root beer and 2 pitchers of stout. stout, as in, alcohol that a bunch of children drank. some of their mugs were half empty. fuck me. 

(i told their parents, they thought it was hilarious, no issues with the boss either. just a funny story.) ",overitatoverit,tfys
504,my therapist’s son tried to get his toddler to hit on me,"this is an old story but probably my most memorable from being a waitress. initially when i realised the name on the booking matched my therapists from when i was a teen, i blew it off thinking surely not. until he and his whole family appeared. we both brushed it off, him very professionally and me awkwardly. this was a buffet so there was really little interaction except behind the bar and clearing tables. 

his son, that i had heard many unflattering stories about, walked his toddler by the bar door. i was sipping on water, trying to take a break. he proceeded to instruct his toddler to ask “the pretty girl for her number”. i think he was going for cute, this baby is gonna get the girl crazy. i had to just awkwardly laugh it off as his child kind of, sort of, said it. there were a lot of other things he tried to get her to say that i can’t even remember now.

i’ve been hit on a few times when i worked in hospo, by parents trying to hook their son up, drunk men etc but this was the most unique. a close second would be when someone asked my boyfriend (we worked together) if i was single and he said yes to be funny.",Rule_hyrule,tfys

506,the never-ending birthday party,"i work at a restaurant popular for their pizza and beer. it’s not causal like an applebee’s but it’s not all that high-end either. i’ve been there for about 3 months now. i was hosting and my manager tells me there’s gonna be a party of 10 at 6:30. no problem at all. 

they walk in and i confirm with them if it’s going to be a party of ten and they look confused. the main lady goes “no, it’s actually going to be 20-25. mind you, we already set up so we had to go back and reset up the tables to accommodate. great. 

a few mins later, the rest of the party trickles in. a man stops and goes, “it’s also my birthday and more people were invited so they might come in as well.” and he just walked off before i ask how many. in the course of 45 mins, our back section is full of people. i’m talking maybe 35-40. they moved from where we had them and spread out all along the section, so even if we wanted to sit other people, we couldn’t. 

their children were running around and screaming and crawling on the ground by other guests. the other guests looked so mortified. then came the happy birthday song. here they are, screaming at the top of their lungs, and they sing not one, but 3 different renditions of the birthday song. they they start to blast their own music. the manager never went over there to ask them to keep it down. 

the two servers only got tipped $5 between the two of them. and they got fed up and refused to serve anyone new who walked in. the party suddenly got up and left and it was quiet. i’m assuming they went into the mall area (we’re connected to a mall) . then maybe 30 mins later, they came back in and sat down for 20 more minutes, they they finally left. 

i had a migraine by the end of the night. ",melaninnmagicc,tfys
507,so done with this place. tip pool and a ridiculous tipout.,"so i've been questioning the owner because on top of pooling our tips, we have a 5.5% tipout (on total sales including tax). 

aside from the host on the weekends there is no support staff. there is me (bartender), one to three servers, the kitchen staff (1-4 ppl depending on the day), and a dish person in the back. 

i made $500 last week working 42 hrs over 5 days. i live in a major city, where servers tend to expect close to that over a weekend.

i posted earlier about the day i worked 12hrs and put $500 in the pool and am only going to get $250. i'm still salty.

the owner is super demanding and kind of a tyrant. needless to say, staff turnover has been horrible. as in, in the past 4 months we've cycled through 3 groups of foh staff (we're currently hiring for the 4th time). people aren't going to bust their ass and constantly get shit on for that kind of money. 

the owner is adamant on not changing things.

i've just come to find, that it looks as though he is using a portion of the tipout to pay for staffs' raised wages. 

for example, in a leadership role i make $2.75 over minimum wage. that $2.75 comes from the tipout. and then all the kitchen are higher than minimum wage, so that too comes from the tipout.

i'm so annoyed and done with this place. currently updating my resume.",novacandy,tfys
508,surprisingly awesome sunday from hell.,"i'm a hostess at a tgichilibees. i've served in the past, but i dont take tables here. 

our restaurant has a bar side, a dining side and two ""cafes"" that can accommodate larger parties.

it started out fine, if a little slow. at around 12:30 each server had 3-4 tables. no biggie. the phone rings and i pick up.

it's a guy who wants to make a reservation for 1:30. for 20 people. great, a little annoying, but my managers would never let me turn it down, we weren't too busy, and we have the space.

so i put them down. he calls back 5 minutes later, actually it's 25 people. and a kids baseball team. i'm groaning internally, but i say it's no problem. 

my manager is fine with it, so at 1:05 i start pushing together the tables. at 1:10 8 people show up from the 25 top arrive. 

she assigns one server to the 25 top, and tells the bartender she's now taking tables on the dining side. 

and then... i dunno, it kind of goes to hell. 

as soon as half the baseball party arrives, we immediately get a 8 top, a 7 top, 2 6 tops, a 5 top and multiple 2-3 tops arrive. 

we all start running around like headless chickens. the manager is taking tables, i find out the server not on the big party has both strep and flu at the same time and had been throwing up all morning. 

2:00 pm arrives. the next server arrives. she basically gets triple sat. 

halfway through the 25 top, some of the adults call me over, they need some refills. coke, 3 waters, and a sweet tea. one of the kids hadn't gotten his chocolate milk for 20 minutes, also could they have some more bud lights? 

i'm not able to ring in anything, so i immediately tell the manager, and i get the refills.

10 minutes later they call me over again, more refills.

they get their food. 10 minutes in, they need more refills, also they never got their mayo and honey mustard that they requested when the food came out.

i assure them i would get on it right away. at this point, i'm very surprised. these people are genuinely polite. i've never seen a 25 top so chill. they've thanked me every single time i get them drinks.

i return with the needed items and one of the moms comes over to me. she requests to speak to the manager. they have some complaints. she assures me it's not about me and says i've been doing great. she also promises to tip me.

i get the manager who has also been running drinks, food, and anything else the tables need. she says she'll be right there as she's grabbing 3 smoothies for the table.

at this point, i notice the server who was supposed to have the 25 top has just kind of vanished. i can't find him anywhere.

everyone minus that one server is still running around. it's about 3:30. the table calls me over and requests dessert. i say i'll get it right out, and tell my manager to put it in. 

10 minutes pass by, and no dessert comes out. i ask the table, and they say they're sure it'll be right out, also could they order another app. and another dessert for here, and another to go. my manager comes over and tells them she forgot to put it in, but it'll be right out. i get the kitchen to send them out on the fly 

now, it's time to divide the checks and pay. my manager takes control of this. the mom who asked for the manager earlier hands me tens bucks and said i did a great job. 

it takes about 20 minutes to process all the checks. at 4:15 the night crew shows up. the 25 top is gone.

we clean up. before i leave, my manager hand me a couple dollar bills. she says the party insisted it go to me. 

to my surprise, they left another 25 bucks for me. so i ended up walking away with 35$ dollars from the party.

i also learn that the server who was assigned the 25 top abandoned them halfway through and was fired on the spot.

it was certainly the most hectic sunday i've ever worked, but i'm glad i did.",PutzyPutzPutzzle,tfys

510,scheduling outside availability +bonus dumb coworker story,"in my interview i made it clear (and it was written down at the time) that i am unable to work tuesdays and thursdays. this was said to be fine. upon my actual hiring, i communicated it again in an email and again, fine. the first week scheduling was good, and i was looking at next weeks schedule and it was the same. but for some reason my friday shift got moved to thursday. i went to my manager and he said he didn't know that i couldn't work those days and asked me to find coverage. but, there's only one person who's not working who doesn't also have a conflict on thursday and she won't switch. i'm not coming to work on thursday. do i just part ways with this restaurant? 

&amp;#x200b;

also, funny side story. at my last shift one of my co-workers was visibly intoxicated. i was weeded and went up to the bar when i saw the bartender put my drink for a table down on it. not a second after he put it down, the drunk waitress who was standing by the bar picked it up and drank it! the owner and the manager were both in the restaurant all night and somehow i got cut before this idiot!

512,customer entitlement,"this is a short one but the entitlement of someone people never ceases to amaze. 

i used to work for my husband's grandparents' restaurant a few years ago. although it's been a while, i've always remained on their facebook page as an admin. i wasn't active on it because people who still worked for the restaurant would handle the page day to day but i was still able to read messages the page would receive. the restaurant was very popular but after a death in the family and health issues it was decided that the restaurant should close.

on the last day of operation the restaurant page received a message that said ""i know it's your last day open but i'm overseas right now. would you be able to save me a plate of (order)?""

did they honeslty expect someone to hold onto food for them to pick up after they returned to the country, however long that may be, or cook them a fresh plate out of their personal home kitchen? the restaurant was known for bending over backwards for customers but luckily they were told no and that was that.",PoofMoof1,tfys
513,got sexually harassed for the first time,"i've had customers say uncomfortable things to be before, but this was the first time someone got physical with me. happened last week. i was taking care of this family, a grandfather, a grandmother, and their college age granddaughter. the grandfather ran his fingers along my arm and up and down my back when he spoke to me. i should've said something, but... i have a hard time speaking up when someone is being (ostensibly) friendly, especially in a professional setting. instead, i just stayed out of his reach after that.

i wondered why neither the grandmother or granddaughter said anything. i mean, i didn't say anything, either, but it's different when it's your own family. if my elderly father had ever done anything like that, i definitely would have put a stop to it. of course, i know my dad would've listened to me, and it's not like that for everyone, but... still seemed kind of weird that his wife would just let that slide, when it's insulting to her, too. different generation, maybe, where that kind of thing was acceptable.",newyne,tfys
514,lonely credit cards,"so. i have a problem coworker. everyone i know hates her, and i've only recently started working with her. one thing that she does that really upsets me is she leaves customer credit cards unattended.

to give some background on the restaurant i work at: it's a tiny little ramen shop with 11 tables (6 2-tops, 5 4-tops). we have our pos on a little cabinet structure near the door and the register in the back. now, when i say pos, i just mean a tablet with an app to ring up customers (it just organizes tickets and manages sales because we hand write our kitchen tickets.) it's right next to a 4-top and literally three feet from the door.

that being said, my coworker keeps leaving credit cards unattended. it's really upsetting me, and she's left two on the little stand next to the pos and one in the kitchen food window. all in one week, two incidents happened on the same night. to make it very clear, these cards are being left out in the open, very clearly seen from inside the restaurant and possibly to the outside to.

today, she tried to lie to me about leaving the credit card unattended by the pos until i called her on it. 

i've worked three shifts with her, and i'm already at my wit's end. i'm trying to take care and protect the customers' we serve. i just don't understand how she can be so careless. am i overreacting to this?? i feel justified in correcting her, but i also feel like some people i've talked to about this don't see it as big of a deal as i'm making it. i just don't know what to do about this anymore.",prettypooperino,tfys

517,our system to combat sexual harrassment,"hi there, restaurant owner here. i read about a restaurant somewhere instituting a system to combat sexual harassment a year ago or so. we implemented it, and it works great. we don't tolerate harassment of any kind. if harassment is a problem at your place, think about adding this:

&amp;#x200b;

**the color system**

at any time, a server, host, whomever, can let a manager know that table ""whatever"" is a code ""color"". what does that mean?

**code yellow**

something about this table is off, or you hear a suspect statement- those of us who have been in the industry can usually pinpoint a problem table quickly. a code yellow communicates to the manager to keep a close eye on the table for issues and that potential problems are coming. the server continues serving the table.

**code orange**

the table has crossed the line, and said/done something that constitutes harassment, in any form, without it being severe. the server immediately stops serving the table, and either the manager or another server takes over the table for the remainder.

**code red**

the table is presented the check and asked to leave. that's it, kicked out.

&amp;#x200b;

the great thing about this system is that it allows a server to use their judgement on their interactions with the table. if a server wants to flirt with a customer, they don't have to call out a code yellow or whatever. if the server is uncomfortable, they can. the manager immediately takes the actions listed above when a server calls a code. after the shift, or when the rush dies down, the manager can debrief with the server to find out the details and provide support or coaching as needed and be able to handle any online feedback from the customer.

&amp;#x200b;

the server has all the power, the server knows exactly what the manager will do when each code is called and the server can make judgement calls as they see fit. everyone in the restaurant knows a debriefing will happen to prevent flippant code calls and if a server shows a lack of judgement on when to call a code, they need to be re-trained or released to find a job they can excel in.

&amp;#x200b;

our staff has been very comfortable with it, and it has never been abused. safe, simple, and empowering.

518,people not being mindful of closing time,"so yeah on mobile and about a bottle of wine down at this point, but i’m irritated. 

i work two jobs. about 45-50 hrs a week at my mon-fri job and currently about 5-7 shifts at the restaurant. i’m exhausted. 

today, normally my only day off during the week, i picked up a double at the restaurant. lunch server and dinner carside. so carside was pretty busy and i was bagging the food and killing it. sweating, red faced and killing it. about thirty minutes to close the other carside person finally went home and i got all my closet mg duties done and waited, and waited, then five minutes to close i get a pickup order.  it’s an easy dish so i tell the guy 10 minutes max it’ll be ready. 

so i wait and wait and wait for this turd to show up. he finally does 20 min past close and then tells me has a god damned coupon when i run his food out to him, go back in and hunt down a fucking manager for the discount and this jackass asks me when i go back out what time we close. i tell him we closed 20 minutes ago. his response “oh, so y’all are just starting to close down! “. no you piece of shit, i’ve been waiting for you to show up for 20 minutes so i can go home, wash my got damned laundry, care for my cats and try to get some got damned sleep before i have to get up at mother fucking 5am for my fucking day job. and of course the jackass left not a fucking cent as a tip.

519,the most fake sounding shit that actually happened,"this is going to sound like a screenplay for r/thathappened for servers, but i promise it's true.

&amp;#x200b;

tonight was an easy night (for me). it was a packed house but we are a very casual restaurant and we have systems and failsafes set in place to make things easy. our party room was maxed out. we had a 40, then a 25, then a 30, all within an hour and a half (maybe two hour) stretch. we accommodated them all and they were fine. the servers taking care of them did an amazing job even though occasionally asking for a spork to be stabbed straight through their eye. having our party room maxed out means that my normal section (six four tops) is going to be rearranged so that i can take party  (5 plus) overflow. that goes for every other server on the floor and we live for nights like this.

&amp;#x200b;

so we're all used to having six tables sat with a random number of people and now we're getting a 7-8 top thrown in the mix but we're all really experienced and okay with it especially because getting sat with one 8 top is easier to deal with than two four tops sat at the same time while we're dealing with our other tables. ya'll know.

&amp;#x200b;

so my night is super smooth despite how chaotic it might look from the outside. i've been casually gliding through my tables all night just happy to make money with zero stress. *and then my last table comes in.* it's two older dudes. for context i have a t-shirt on that celebrates our restaurants 60 year anniversary and it's styled so that the 60 is right above my left breast. (and it's super awkward when people read it in front of you and mention it which happened once before this table.)

&amp;#x200b;

i'm heading to the table and they're waving me over. i'm going to condense this interaction to the most important parts as much as i can especially since a lot of it was them talking over each other *and* me.

&amp;#x200b;

hey my name is silly\_hobbit! what can i get you to drink tonight? (normally i would suggestive sell but fuck off because you waved me over and also you're my last table and i'm pretty over it)

&amp;#x200b;

dude 1 (bill murray look-a-like): i'll take a w-w-water. so are you really 60?

&amp;#x200b;

me: yeah!

&amp;#x200b;

dude 2 (wearing a floppy lsu sun cap) : is your sweet tea good?

&amp;#x200b;

me: yeah! it's really sweet!

&amp;#x200b;

sun cap: i asked if it was good.

&amp;#x200b;

bill (not-murray): you're not 60!

&amp;#x200b;

me: yeah! i'm really 60! i'm a woods witch! i'll be right back with your drinks!

&amp;#x200b;

bill (not-murray): we're gonna have three people!

&amp;#x200b;

me: (fucking kill me.)

&amp;#x200b;

so i walk away and make their drinks and by the time i get them to the table the third party has joined. he very obviously looks me up and down (continuously) while i'm putting the drinks down and i ask him if he needs anything to drink (because he already has a beer he grabbed from the bar so i'm just being courteous) and he starts asking me random questions about the menu while peppering in sexual comments about me such as:

&amp;#x200b;

him (maroon shirt): you're cute...(many sexual innuendos)...how's the food here?

&amp;#x200b;

me: i don't know i don't eat it! (lies)

&amp;#x200b;

maroon shirt: oh is that how you keep your figure?

&amp;#x200b;

me: aha! ahahaha!

&amp;#x200b;

i put their order in and while i'm waiting on the food i keep dealing with sexual comments from them. maroon shirt guy keeps saying they tip well and gazes at my breast (and waist for good measure) and asks if i'm actually 60. here we go again. i joke around with them and try to convince them that i'm actually 60 years old. for context i'm 30 but everyone thinks i'm around 22 so i get disrespected a lot (a whole other issue). then floppy sun cap dude sits up and tells me that he can prove to me that i'm not 60 and heres *why:*

&amp;#x200b;

***""because i've never been attracted to a 60 year old woman.""***

&amp;#x200b;

i died. a whole lot. and then i swallowed my pride because i didn't know what to say and i'm broke and i wanted to make the most out of any table i can get, even if that means putting up with some super sexist bullshit occasionally. so i made a joke and walked away and when their food was ready i asked a coworker to take it to them. i went to check on them later and a lot of sexual innuendoes that aren't worth writing out here happened. finally sun cap asked about desert. we sell two desserts. banana pudding is our best. he wanted a lot of cookies in his pudding and wanted me to make that happen. he said he wouldn't ""discontinue my tip"" if there wasn't a lot of cookies but if there were a lot of cookies he would make it worth my while. i go in the kitchen and make his pudding myself, trying to get the most cookies i can. i take it to the table and jokingly (and honestly) tell him that that is the most cookies you could possibly get in a serving of banana pudding. he starts telling me that ""if you're cute your mistakes aren't noticed as much.""

&amp;#x200b;

i laughingly tell him i didn't make any mistakes. (cause i fucking hadn't) and he starts in with this:

&amp;#x200b;

sun cap: if you're ugly though, your mistakes matter a lot more. you gotta be cute. women gotta be cute.

&amp;#x200b;

me: so do men have to be cute too? when they make mistakes?

&amp;#x200b;

sun cap: \*shakes head vigorously\* men are supposed to be financially secure.

&amp;#x200b;

me:

&amp;#x200b;

sun cap: see these cute gay women...i think they can be saved. but the men like that? they should be rounded up and shot.

&amp;#x200b;

me: (not making eye contact) **sir, you can keep your tip.**

&amp;#x200b;

i walked away and asked a male coworker to take them.

&amp;#x200b;

i immediately told my gm. he told me that i should ask our security guard to keep an eye on tables like that in the future so i can have a witness to the customers fuckery. i get where he's coming from but the security guard would never get close enough to a table to hear dialogue like that and even if he did he's an off duty cop who doesn't give a shit and isn't going to do *shit* about a woman that isn't related to him being harassed.

&amp;#x200b;

i still had to clean my section up after that. i stalled for about ten minutes but finally decided that i wasn't going to let them ruin my night so i cleaned up my messy section all around them while they sat there and tried to taunt me over with comments like ""ohhh....don't let our waitress hear you say that.""

&amp;#x200b;

and then

&amp;#x200b;

i was sweeping under a table close to them. sun cap stands up and asks where the bathroom is. i debate not answering but it's not long before i point him up the stairs with a short, ""it's up there.""

&amp;#x200b;

i move on to sweeping under another table, a booth. i'm bending over because i have to to get out all of the trash under the booth seats. i feel a presence behind me and glance back and sun cap is directly behind me, squeezing between me and the table behind me, **uber** silently. when i jerk away he mutters a dismissive ""excuse me."" if the picture wasn't painted clearly enough, my ass was ""in the air"" as they say and i turn around and his crotch is lined up right behind it when he could have taken another route to get to his table. even if he had no other route he should have warned me he was walking up dangerously close to me.

&amp;#x200b;

i just needed to vent. i've been in the industry for 5+ years now and i've dealt with a lot of sexual advances/innuendoes, more than my male coworkers or managers think i have, and have never voiced them on the internet but tonight i just needed to.

&amp;#x200b;

if you made it this far thanks for listening.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: men made sexual advances at me, i kept a professional demeanor even when they told me gays should be rounded up and shot and i responded with telling them they could keep their tip and going for a much needed smoke.

520,"""there's a stone in my bread!""","i was serving at a greek restaurant a few years back, when an older woman called me over to the table. ""excuse me,"" she flagged me down hastily. ""there's a stone in my bread!"" 

we made the bread fresh throughout the day. this was very delicious and fluffy bread that had a great reputation. i was immediately flabbergasted. the customer went from zero to irate in moments. saying things like, ""how could the chef let this happen? this is an outrage! i could have chipped a tooth!"" i had no answers for her. she insisted i go back to the chef and show him the stone to prevent this from happening again. i obliged, of course. she had it wrapped up in a discarded butter foil and handed it to me on a plate. 

i brought it in to show the chef and unwrapped it for the first time. there, in the bright light of the kitchen, was clearly a greasy, buttery, pebble-sized, yellow chunk of this woman's tooth. i hardly said a word about it to the chef, just walked back out and deposited it back on the woman's table. by then she was sitting smugly, waiting for her offering of a comped meal or dessert. 

""i apologize, ma'am, but that's your tooth,"" i said as i pointed to the disdainful butter wrapper on the bread plate. ""do you want to keep it? maybe they can glue it back in?"" she looked at me sheepishly as she felt around her mouth for the missing chunk of tooth. she slid the plate back toward her, took the butter wrapper and deposited it into her purse. she then carried on her meal with no further apology or conversation about the incident. people!",j_capetch,tfys
521,creepy old man orders food 3 times in 30 minutes so he can check me out,"so i work in to-go food. pretty much i run food out to cars and stand by the car while they sign. 

i go out to this man who was over an hour late to pick up. i asked him to sign as i handed his food through the window. he proceeded to very obviously look me up and down, stop at my chest, and say “hmm looks like i’ll be needed some more food from here tonight. when do you work until?” i lied and said i was leaving soon. as i walked back inside i can see him checking out my butt in the reflection of the door.

five minutes later he calls and orders the exact same thing and says “make sure you send out the girl i spoke with before” as soon as he got there, my manger sent out the guy who was on shift to his car and me to the other that had pulled up. i overheard him ask if he could please speak to me instead of my coworker whenever i was done. he then switched from sunglasses to glasses and rolled down his window to watch me while i had the other customer sign, then waved me over all while his eyes were on my chest and ordered the same $10 item for the third time.  again he watched me walk inside. 

at that point i was over it, so i just took the food out and handed it to him without speaking.

522,the true purpose of the gratuity,"i have always felt that grats were less a payment or appreciation for service (as in ""here's a little extra for you"") and more of a way to keep the transaction amicable and to prevent servers from feeling more like servants. or to put it another way, a system to delay feelings of resentment in people who serve people often and repeatedly. 
does anyone else feel this way? what are your thoughts?

523,my creepiest customer,"i used to be a server at an i hop a few years ago when i was a teenager. one day i was working the swing shift when one of the newer co-workers came up to me saying that a customer was annoyed and she didn't know how to handle him. i ended up taking the table instead.  

the table was a man in his 60's visibly pissed. i did my usual greeting, and asked him how he was. he immediately starts off on a rant about a fight with his wife. at this point he is the only customer in the store so i take his order, get his drink, and sit down to let him rant. i talk to customers when business is slow and they want some company, however this was different. 

during our conversation he kept saying things like how he should kill his wife or himself and while we were talking another couple walks in and my co-worker takes the table and they're sitting in pretty close proximity to us. i'm pretty uncomfortable at this point and i was worried that some of the things he was saying would freak out the other customers. by the end of the conversation, i was ready for him to leave so i ended up comping his meal. he asks me to box up whatever is left and then he asks me to put the togo order in his car. i'm nervous but i run outside to the car in front of the store in a handicapped spot and open up the door to the backseat and run back in really fast before the guy is able to leave the table. i tell him where i put his food and he says something to the effect of, ""no i need the food in the front seat. you need to put the food in the front seat.""  

my stomach drops because this guy was kinda freaking me out, but i didn't want to be rude so i turn around and head back to his car. except this time he follows me outside and i look back to the store and through the window i can see the couple, the man on his phone standing up and calling the police. turns out the couple also heard what the guy was saying and were also really uncomfortable. i put the food in the front seat and ran back inside and had a full on panic attack. 

the police show up and talk to me and talk to the man who was just sitting in his car. i had composed myself by then and was trying to brush it off. about thirty minutes after the police left, one of my coworkers came up to me and said the old man was parked out back. sure enough i went to the back of the store where we all took our breaks and he was parked behind the store just sitting there. 

i had another panic attack, because i have bad anxiety and i didn't leave the store until i was for sure he was gone. ",erhowell,tfys

her response was, “well what else was i supposed to do with my gum?!”

525,one of my tables on saturday were angry that they got their table faster than the quoted time.,"first time i've had this one happen. 

i walked up to my eight top that was sat with six people. the people were pretty standard customers for our weekend crowd. the only difference is that these people were literally eating ice cream cones at the table.



me: ""hey folks how are we doing tonight? my name is.. blah..."" 

her: ""not too good, i'm only being honest since you asked."" 

me: ""um, whats the problem ma'am?"" 

her: ""we were quoted an hour and forty five minutes for this table when we put our name in. after twenty minutes they sent us a text.""




after going back and fourth, setting them up with drinks (waters all around of course), they ordered two sandwiches and two kids meals. the mom went on to tell me that she ""lost her appetite"" with the experience and didn't want to order.

this all happened during our dinner rush. this family took up an eight top, ordered $45 worth of food, when our average ppa is around $30. afterwards they asked to split the check and two and tipped me $9.

the managers were dumbfounded and after years of serving this is the first time i have ever experienced a table being angry at getting a table quicker than the time quoted when our average wait for the day was two hours for walk up reservations. through random luck as soon as they added their name to the list, the party ahead of them no-showed and they got bumped up. 

tldr:

- country folk angry that their pre-dinner dessert was interrupting rudely by getting their table faster than the quoted time.

- mom ""loses appetite"" after eating gigantic cone and is angry with the experience.
table orders $45 when a typical eight top sends $300-$500.
- ends up tipping 20% on $45 and surprisingly doesn't ask for the manager.",ServePro,tfys

528,double feature: i got my first complaint to the manager and bad review!,"this is a fun, action-packed one! this happened last night. i'd had a great night. all of my tables had tipped 20-50% ($150 on a $300-- woo!). of course this had to be too good to be true. 

a table of five came in about half an hour before closing while i was doing side work. over the course of the night, i'd forgotten to bring them a couple of items, so they complained to my manager. i'd forgotten a drink because, after ordering it, they'd kept me at their table for 10 minutes saying they were ready to order, but they weren't... instead they asked me a ton of questions that could've been answered by actually reading the menu. then i'd forgotten tabasco sauce because they'd asked for about 6 things when they got their food, including an extra side of fries, which i had to beg the kitchen to give me (completely separate issue). i mean, i definitely shouldn't have forgotten anything and i was annoyed at myself, but it happens, especially at the end of a long night.

i'm friends with my manager, so he pretended to give me a stern talking to, and told me to comp $10 worth of food off their bill. he told my table about the comp and when he walked away, another waitress heard one of the patrons say, ""ugh, but we still have to pay for all of this food!"" we'd suspected they'd only complained to get money taken off, but now we knew!

dropped their $65 check and they complained to my manager again, this time saying the food (which they’d eaten most of) wasn't good, etc. he didn't comp anything else. a few minutes later they left and the bus boy came in saying they'd left only $20. he and the manager ran after them (hopped over a few chairs in the process) and caught up to them a few blocks down trying to run away. 

they made a bunch of excuses and even tried saying they got bad service because they were the only poc table in the restaurant (they were only one of three tables even there). my manager just kept shutting them down, saying they were stealing if they didn't pay for their food and he'd call the police. they didn't even have enough money between the five of them to pay for their already comped check (they had $64)! clearly, they'd never intended on paying for their food. manager told them not to come back.

then, they left a review for the restaurant saying the servers were miserable and the food was bad. and they pointed out that the bartender had skipped a michael jackson song, but didn't skip any songs by white artists. ",eecb23,tfys
529,woman gets nasty when she discovers i'm not telepathic,"today i took a party of 8 at our family table. 3 of them arrived before the others, and i greeted them to see if they wanted drinks while they waited for the others to arrive. at one point the eldest lady at the table said something along the lines of ""we're just country folk"" which wasnt warranted at all, and i dont know why she said it. also, they were not country folk whatsoever. 

anyways this post is about an odd and enraging interaction i had with the eldest lady. (she was probably in her 50s-60s). we will call her ""tea bitch"". 

so when i grabbed the initial drink order, tea bitch had said water, and then her annoying daughter strongly encouraged her to get a blackberry pineapple tea. tea bitch made a comment saying she'll see if she likes it and to bring her a glass. i brought the tea. tea bitch consumed the entire glass of tea in less than five minutes. 

i assumed that means she enjoyed the tea, so i prepared another one and dropped it off to her, a completely innocent and normal procedure for all servers who get refills.  immediately some other girl at the table said in an urgent, snarky tone ""no she wanted to try another flavor"" her tone kind of implying i should have already known that. yet no one once told me to switch the tea flavor and i wouldnt assume she disliked a tea that she literally sucked down in two minutes. 

i laughed cheerfully, trying to keep things light, and said ""oh i'm so sorry, she finished it so i thought she might have liked it!"" and then tea bitch says the bitchiest, most senseless thing i've ever heard come out a guest's mouth. 

""well, you're a waitress, so."" 

.........yes i am a waitress, does that mean i'm supposed to read your fucking mind and know that even though you sucked down your first tea at the speed of light that you actually didnt like it and wanted to switch flavors? what a fucking straight up cunt. 

tea bitch was *extremely* rude and short with me for the rest of service. it's just funny because she's the one who said they're just country folk, i guess that was code for ""we're stupid as hell and assume servers are telepathic"". 

on top of this bullshit interaction, tea bitch's daughter had me bring out 6 xtra ranches, 6 xtra italians, 2 cups of xtra black olives, 2 cups of xtra croutons, and all the guests individually modified their salads so i had to make like 6 different fucking salads. then they needed more dressing after they used the first 12 cups. 

anyways, i wanted revenge on this self proclaimed hillbilly so i made sure to charge her for both teas. too bad someone else paid the whole bill cus i was going to enjoy the fuck out of explaining to that bitch that you don't get two different teas for free just because you 'didnt like' one of the teas that you already drank in entirety. 

people are stupid, bro.

530,a man yells at me for a mistake at our takeaway service,"i’m on mobile, so sorry about the formatting. english also isn’t my first language, so i’m sorry if i make any mistakes. i also hope that this is the right sub.

i work at a chinese restaurant. the restaurant is quite expensive and fancy, but we also have a takeaway service. it is said to be the best chinese restaurant in our city so it often gets very busy.

because it’s a chinese restaurant, we have a lot of chinese employees. they all speak our language pretty well, but of course not perfectly. they mostly work in the restaurant while us non-chinese employees focus on the takeaway. if it gets busy, we usually jump in to help each other if it’s needed.

at the takeaway, customers can order through the phone. we ask for their names and we write them on their receipt, so we can easily see what someone ordered when they come in and say their name. this doesn’t always happen perfectly, because it’s sometimes difficult to hear someones name through the phone, especially if they have an uncommon name. we just write down what we hear and it usually ends up being quite similar. writing uncommon names down is obviously very difficult for the chinese employees, which is why they don’t pick up the phone often.

this evening it was very busy at the takeaway but not busy in the restaurant, so a few of the chinese employees jumped in to help us. this is probably where a mistake happened.

a man placed an order through the phone with a quite uncommon name, so a chinese employee probably didn’t know what to write down. she wrote down what she heard, but for a native speaker of the language what she wrote down wasn’t that similar to the actual name (i heard the name afterwards).

a little boy (about 10 years old) came in to pick up that order, but of course we couldn’t find the receipt with his name on it. we asked him if he knew what the order was so we could find the right one without knowing the name, but he didn’t know anything. the owner of the restaurant knew his parents, so she offered to call them and ask them what the order was. the boy didn’t want that, so we gave him the order with the name that sounded the most similar to his actual name.

of course, it turned out that that was not the right order. a few minutes later a man came in, and we found out we gave his order to the little boy. the man didn’t mind it, so we asked the kitchen to make his order first so he didn’t have to wait a long time, because it was still very busy. this man got his order, but the little boy got the wrong one.

after a while, an employee got a phone call from the boy’s mother. she was mad because we gave them the wrong order, which i can understand. the employee explained politely that it’s difficult to hear someone’s name through the phone and that that’s where a mistake happened. she told her that we’ll make sure they get their right order and that she can come and pick it up right away. she also told her politely that she should tell her son what they had ordered or give him a note or something, or pick it up herself. that way a mistake can be prevented. she wasn’t happy with this, but she said that she’ll come and pick the order up.

we checked the order twice so that they definitely got it right this time. the little boy came in again (his parents still didn’t come) and we gave him his order. we thought that everything was fine now, but sadly enough it wasn’t.

i was taking orders through the phone when i received a phone call from the boy’s dad. i don’t exactly remember our conversation, but this is the closest i remember.

me = me, of course, ac= angry customer

me: good evening, (name of the restaurant)

ac: you gave my son the wrong order and that’s your fault, not his.

he didn’t say hello or anything, he just immediately started screaming at me. because of what he said, i figured he was the dad of the little boy. just so you know, he kept screaming through our entire conversation.

me: oh, are you the father who sent his son to pick up the order?

ac: yes i am, and that would have been fine if you did your work properly.

me: i’m sorry for the mistake, it was indeed our fault that this took place and we apologise for that,

ac: yeah, it was your fault. how dare you even say my son had anything to do with this?

me: he didn’t have anything to do with it. but like my coworker already said, it might be smart to inform him of what you have ordered or to pick it up yourself. this way we can still give you the right order if a mistake happens.

ac: oh, you think that might be smart? i think it might be smart to let someone pick up the phone who properly speaks (our language) instead of some foreigner. this is entirely your fault.

at this point i was getting very frustrated. it was very busy and this man kept screaming louder and louder at me. i remained calm, but that was going to change if he kept screaming at me while i just tried to explain everything.

me: sir, you got your order right? we did everything to make sure you received your order as fast as possible, so i don’t understand why you called us again. we can’t do anything more than this and yelling is not going to help anyone.

after i said this he hung up without saying anything. i still don’t understand why he was so mad: we gave his son the right order the second time and we apologised for our mistake. also, how can you be mad about chinese people working at a chinese restaurant? most of our employees are chinese and they do their job very well, so this is just pure racism.

i do think i handled that phone call pretty well. i’m a shy person so it was very scary to me to have someone yelling at me for a mistake that i didn’t even make.

let’s just hope that those people search for a different takeaway and that we don’t have to deal with them again.

i am a new server, only been here about a month. i was feeling a little overwhelmed because the guy who organized this party is known to be an asshole and he was very demanding. 

i was refilling waters and this guy was like “we were just talking about how you have really nice skin! you are just glowing!” then 2 more of them preceded to compliment my skin.

the only makeup i had on was mascara, my foundation was leftover from the day before. i was so happy! i am 21 and have been struggling with hormonal acne for awhile, and this past year i have found a skin care routine that really has helped. i have always been really insecure about my skin and this really boosted my confidence!

533,please watch and properly take care of your children while dinning out,"i had a table of 7 come in last night during our dinner rush. it was a mom, dad, their 3 babies/toddlers and the two grandparents. 

right away things started out great when the mom, who still looks pretty young asks for a margarita and then gets upset when i ask to id her. “ugh, everyone in this restaurant knows me, i come here all of the time” to which the grandpa adds “c’mon, of course she’s over 21, she has 3 kids” um ok? that still doesn’t mean i don’t need to card her. it’s illegal and i’m not about to get a $1,000 fine. 

anyways, moving on to when they get their food. their 3 little boys are screaming and the infant is crawling all over their table sticking his hands and feet all over the food (it’s gross but whatever). they keep demanding refills of soda for the 4 year old because the two year old keeps “stealing” his soda. overall a nightmare to wait on when you’re super busy with a bunch of other tables.

when they finally leave, this sweet older couple at another table flag me down and say “hi honey, you might want to clean and disenfect all of those salt and pepper shakers at that table because those kids had them in their mouths” 

apparently the grandma saw this happen but was cooing and giggling over it when they were still dining saying how cute her grandboys were. she didn’t think to let anyone know that they had their saliva all over the salt and pepper shakers. please, control your children if you go out to eat with them. please. 

edit: *dining (in title) 

edit 2: i got some people asking about how they tipped. it was funny because my manager told me that she actually had seen them in before and that they own a restaurant themselves in the same city and are super well off so that’s maybe why they seemed a little entitled and rude. so, i was kind of hoping that even though it was an overall nightmare of a table maybe they had some kindness in them to tip me good since they had money and also owned their own restaurant but they ended up using a gift card and then tipping me a little less than 10% (not that bad i guess, but still lol)

534,"""you know there's flour on top of your hat, right?"" ""no?""","hi! this happened to me about 2 and a half years ago when i was working at a pizza place that basically ran like a subway: pick your dough and then go down the line building this personal size pizza. this is pretty long because i have to lay a few things out, also gm: gluten free mom.

we were super accommodating to gf allergies, making sure to change gloves, switch sauce scoops, change cutters, delicious gluten free dough, etc. there was a sign on the menu letting people know that it was possible for cross contamination as we move fast, so not to risk it if it was a severe gf allergy, but we do the best we can. there was one mom and daughter that always came in and ordered a gf pizza and were never super kind, even though we were all smiles every time they were here. 

&amp;#x200b;

side note: we wore visors or hats, but because my head is pretty small i opted for a visor because they were easy to fasten and i could adjust it really quickly if necessary. when i would be making pizzas, it would often start to slide down my forehead and i would just give it a quick push up so that i could see the customer (i'm really short and it was usually done without a second thought). 

&amp;#x200b;

so, one friday night it was extremely busy and i was at the head of the line sheeting dough as fast as possible to keep up. we used the metal machine that flattens dough out for you, and it is covered in flour. after i got enough dough out, i switched to the pizza line because i could crank them out. i help the gluten free family, i know how they like it made- very specific things- and then sent them on their way. 30 minutes go by, the line is still to the door, and i am helping a really nice girl who wants a popular pizza but she wants to change a few things about it. as i am getting towards the last few changes, my coworker calls me over and i can see gm standing there looking pissed. i ask my coworker if everything is okay and he just shrugs and says she kept asking for me. i leave the unfinished pizza because i assume this will be fast, after all, anybody can see the line is still getting longer and nobody has stopped moving for hours. 

i walk over to her and our conversation goes like this:

&amp;#x200b;

me: hi! is everything okay? how was the pizza?

gm: it was fine, i am just needing to talk to you because you made our gluten free pizza.

me: yes! i changed out gloves, made sure it didn't touch anything-

gm: well... i'm not sure if you know this but.. there's flour on top of your visor, and you pushed it up and then continued the pizza..

me: ohmygod im so sorry! i actually can't see the top of my visor (duh)! but i can absolutely go make you a new pizza right now! (clearly trying to get back to the line) 

gm: no no no, she isn't even that bad, but some people could be..

me:  it does say there's a chance of contamination so not to risk it if you are that bad, but  i can go change gloves right now if that will make you feel better? 

gm: ... thats not really what i am looking for..

\*we went back a forth a few times with me offering different things and her saying that wasn't what she was looking for\*

me: um, well i will definitely try to be more aware nex-

gm: yes!! (clapping) that was allll i wanted to hear! you are lucky i am just calling you over to discuss then instead of directly telling your manager about this.

me: well, thank you very much but i really need to get back to the line!!

&amp;#x200b;

of course, the pizza i had been making was put in wrong because i wasn't there to finish it with the changes, so we had to remake that holding up the line even more than she already did to it. i told my manager about it later because i was so flustered.. he cracked up at the thought of her telling on me for something i had no way of knowing (and because i was a great worker), and i never had to make her pizza again whenever she came back. of course gluten allergies are really important to be cautious of, but all she had to do was tell me as i was making her pizza that i had touched flour and i would go change hats/gloves/pizza/everything.

m: oh! it is at [insert address]

c: can you tell me what other places are around you? 

m: we are near [blank] and [blank] (which happens to be a mexican restaurant). 

c: you are a mexican restaurant?

m: no! we are near a mexican restaurant. we are actually a burger joint. 

c: so wait... are you mexican then? 

m:.... um... no ma'am. i am not...

c: so then, what country were you born in? 

m:.... america? 

c: what state? 

m: [lists state name]

c: you know, those immigrants from mexico are okay, but they keep stealing our jobs and that is not okay! they can come to america, but they can't steal our jobs!!! they just need to come here and make a living, but not through our jobs. 

at this point, i am so weird-ed out by the conversation, but if i hung up i would get yelled at by management so i just have to suck it up and deal with it. the lady goes on for another 3 minutes! ranting and raving about immigrants being okay, but they can't have jobs in america because then it would be stealing ours? i don't know to be honest. it seemed very contradictory to me. 

the lady finally says, c: thank you for talking to me, bye! 
and hangs up. i slowly put the phone down and is so confused by what happened. now, the story should end here... but it doesn't. 

i continued going through my shift and am wiping a table off. someone comes in and one of the servers comes over to seat them. 

c: are you the mexican lady i talked to on the phone? 

the server is very confused as we don't have a single mexican lady working for our establishment. she comes over and gets me (as i am the only one who is suppose to answer the phone)

c: you're not the mexican lady... 
she almost said this disappointingly?

i sat them (her husband and her) down, and the entire time they were there she demanded me to do things for her (totally ignoring her server). at one point, i had to tell her to stop coming up to me because it is not my job to serve her (as most of her requests involved alcohol and i am under the age of 20 and a day, which is when you can serve alcohol in restaurants in america). she went ballistic and demanded i be fired for lying and not serving her! my manger calmed her down, and later had to kick her out because she refused to leave until i was fired. the police had to be called and she was banned from stepping foot in the restaurant after resisting police officers from escorting her off the premises. 

to this day, my co-workers joke about ""me being a mexican immigrant"" and ""stealing people's jobs"". 

edit: so, my girlfriend and i looked up the age to serve alcohol in our state and it is 19 to serve, but the county in which she works at is highly restrictive and does not allow anyone under 20 to serve. that is a mistake on our part, but we both aren't 20 so she wouldn't be able to serve alcohol regardless.

me: “yeah there is actually a reason why the door it locked!”
lady: “well that reason doesn’t exist any more”

542,notes on receipt?,"so yesterday my family and i at a restaurant called yard house, i’m unsure if it is national or regional. we enjoy the place, and go fairly often. 

the service is normally very good, but we had a waitress yesterday that went above and beyond. we ordered apps, dinners, and deserts, no alcohol. the main course took a little longer than usual (not the waitress’ fault) to come out, but she kept checking in on us and keeping our drinks refilled and clearing any dishes we had (i’m ocd so i love this, i hate a messy table). i felt this was a lot of individual attention for how busy the place was. 

i’m normally a very generous tipper anywhere i go, unless the service is absolutely terrible. so our bill came to $123.15, and i have this weird mental issue that the total has to equal a round number (ocd again). i wanted this lady to know that we appreciated her hard work, so i tipped $76.85 to make the total $200 even. 

my question is that i also wrote a note on the receipt. to the side of the total lines, i wrote “great job!!”. i’m questioning this decision, and worry that it could have been viewed as patronizing or condescending. of course she did a great job; she is a professional in a nice establishment. she doesn’t need me to pat her head like a toddler. 

so, if someone were to write you such a note, how would you view it? i do not personally know any servers to ask.

lastly, while i am here, how much of that tip does she actually get to keep for herself?

thank you for your time.",brad44090,tfys
543,"not deaf, just rude.","
on mobile yadda yadda.

background: i live in a town with a huge deaf population. we have a deaf school where parents from all over the country send the kids, almost all of our businesses have asl fluent/ deaf workers on staff to accommodate deaf customers. if you saw that starbucks drive thru video where the server used the video ordering screen to sign to a customer in drive thru, that video was taken in the town i am from and is a common thing.

so one day i am working in the back office doing filing work when one of the other servers got a customer who she thought was deaf.
the customer didn't reply when the hostess greeted her, just held up one finger to indicate that she was eating alone. then when the server went to greet her she just waved her off to indicate she wasn't ready. at this point the server didn't know if she was deaf. 

when the customer was ready to order she just menu to order. she pointed to a burger.

server: how would you like that cooked?
customer: *points at menu again""
server:* gestures that she will be right back*

server runs to the back to grab me because she doesn't sign. i walk out to the table and start signing.

me: (signing) hi how are you i'm kgalb, what can i get for you?
customer: *points to menu again
me:(signing) sure! one burger, how would you like that cooked?
customer:* points again

so at this point i write down what i am asking in case she doesn't sign and hand it to her.

customer: (speaking) i just want the fucking burger! how hard is that for you to get?!

edit to add: we explained to her she had to tell us how she wanted it cooked and after going back and forth explaining levels of done-ness she finally  decided and ordered  using her words.

tldr:customer doesn't speak while ordering because she is rude, not deaf.

550,finally a story with a happy ending (for me).,"at least the first in a long time. i'm a cocktail waitress in a casino, and tonight i was on table games. when i came back from my break, i had a new guy in my section drinking budweiser. whenever i first saw him, i could already tell he's had quite a few. but whatever, i avoided him best i could for the most part of the night, spacing him out for 2 beers every hour.

every time he would order from me, he already had a full beer. i guess not realizing. not usually a big deal, when someone has a full beer they can usually have most of it gone by the time you bring it back, depending on how busy you are. 

now in the casinos, at least in my state, you can't have more than two alcoholic drinks at a time. so naturally when i'd bring him one, i would tell him he's got to be done with the other before i can give him a new one. this would lead him to chug his whole beer, and whatnot. it's really usually not a big deal but this guy was already tanked. 

keep in mind, this dude has not tipped me at a l l. he finally gave me maybe $2 for the whole night, perhaps for 10 beers. but that's beside the point. i got fed up with him trying to pull a fast one on me, because it wasn't working. he looked at me, and said, ""can you bring me another budweiser and set it over there?"" and pointed to the end of the table as if to make it look like it's not his. 

i told him, ""no. i'll bring you a new one when that one is empty."" 

he said, ""ma'am, i am losing more money in an hour than you are making all night."" 

then i hit him with, ""well, i won't have *any* money if i don't have a job."" he said, ""but i'll tip you."" (oh gee golly, really?! well i change my mind then)

i immediately phoned my supervisor and told him the situation, and he *actually cut him off and send him to his hotel room* and i'm just honestly amazed because every time i try to tell a supervisor someone needs a cut off, they just tell me to avoid them. but holy fuck, i feel so good because fuck you, budweiser dude. fuck you every much. fuck off and sober up.

551,"if your so works at the restaurant, maybe treat the rest of the staff with decency?","sorry this is long, tldr at the bottom!

last night, friday night, was busy as always. i was having a bit of a rough shift already, as i sliced my finger on a big knife earlier in the night &amp; was continuously getting double/triple sat.

in comes my last table before cuts. just a single woman who had been drinking/eating previously at the bar. i noticed her walking around the restaurant and talking to our hosts/servers and other random guests as i was tending to my other tables. someone then informed me that her wife was a busser at the restaurant and to generally not worry about her, she had her food and drinks already.

i clear off my last tables, and now it's just her. i start on my sidework, and was planning on dropping the check off just to get payment for check out. every time i tried, she wasn't at the table, but was outside smoking a cigarette/talking to random guests. after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, i get permission to go outside and ask her to close out the check.

as politely as i can, i tell her no rush at all, and ask if i can get a card to close it out. long story short, she wasn't happy about that, and went off on me. i apologized and walked back inside as she kept popping off.. just wondering what exactly i said wrong.

after another 10 minutes, she makes her way back in and asks to see her wife. they proceed to shit talk me in spanish and english, and involve tables around them. they notice me watching and the busser walks away, but the wife waves me over. she starts to tell me i am the rudest person she's ever met, she can't believe the audacity of me, etc; (very loudly). other guests start to stare as i'm apologizing profusely to her and reassuring her that i absolutely meant no harm, that i only want to go home. i really didn't mean to rush her, the payment just checks me out of the system.

she threw her credit card on the check and told me not to touch it, because she would pay at the bar.

when she goes to the bar, she tells the bartender that ""the server was so terrible"" and any tip would only go to her, as i ""didn't deserve a cent"". at this point, i don't give a shit, i just need payment to close it off and leave. i already knew she wasn't going to tip me. the second the bartender swiped her card, i closed it out, ran my check out, and went to the office to cash out. i also noticed the busser lingering around the office, and i later found out she was asking everyone what i was saying/gossiping about me around the restaurant. i reported the situation to my gm before leaving the office.

as i was clocking out at the only open terminal, (near the bar), the woman looks at me sideways and says,

""aw.. i thought you needed to go home?""

i'll admit. i stared at her in disbelief. but i was clocked out and had enough.

me: ""why are you acting the way that you are? why do you think this is ok?""

her: ""i just asked a question since you were rushing me before. when are you leaving?""

me: ""have you forgotten your wife works here too? or do you just normally harass workers when you dine out?""

at this point, a manager caught wind of it and walked over to pull me aside. as i was catching her up on everything, the woman started to scream at us.

her: ""hey! hey! whatever you're saying over there about me, say it to my face!! i want to hear what she's saying, come say it to me!!!""

my manager rushed over to her, and i followed. the woman was mocking me and telling the manager how absurd i've been, and i finally just realized how stupid this was...

me: ""unlike your wife, this is not my career. your actions reflect on her. you know what? i'm better than this. have a good night""

and i walked out. i'm off today and go back in sunday, but i haven't heard anything new.. only that it's the gossip of the restaurant for today. yay me!

554,my gm forgets that health code is a thing.,"  

sorry for this long story today. 

so, i work in a movie theater that also provides full restaurant and bar service. as all movie theaters and restaurants do, we have a very strict no outside food/drink policy that we are reminded constantly to enforce. 

today is my lucky day, because, with the new release of captain marvel, we are fully sold out and up to our ears in chaos. in comes a couple with a full three-course meal sourced from a local burger place. now, as most of you know, the reason for the no outside food rule is not only so we can sell our own food, but also because it is a major violation of food safety and health code. additionally, if the couple or anyone around them gets sick, the company can be liable despite outside contaminants. 

i go up to the couple with my best sympathetic face on and give the whole spiel about how i’m so sorry, but i am going to have to confiscate their food and will be able to give it back to them at the end of the movie. the man immediately becomes belligerent and demands a manager. cool, no problem, my managers would surely back me up on such an obvious infraction of our rules. 

nope. my gm, who by all accounts is a nice guy, goes over to the couple with me. mr. man demands to be able to keep his food but promises not to eat it during the movie. cut to me rolling my eyes internally waiting for my manager to tell him, sorry but that just isn’t happening.  much to my surprise and embarrassment, my gm \*agrees\* to this arrangement. 

i. am. livid. i just got thrown under the bus in front a guest and gm walks away like it’s no big deal. after experiencing a moment of pure rage, i literally run after my gm and remind him that this is a major health code violation. worst case scenario, they get food poisoning and blame it on the company and we get screwed. his response, 

“oh, yeah. in that case, i guess i should go take it from them.”

um, what? like, good on you for actually following your own rules, but how do you just forget why our rules exist? also, now we all look like double idiots for changing our minds about an issue. also also, i can no longer trust my managers to enforce the rules that they themselves are telling us to follow.  how is it that a server who gets paid $2 an hour is more mindful of liability risks than the top brass of the store?

background info: i work in a kitchen. i make the food, work the register, serve the customers. we do a lot, but it's simple work and passable money. i also have a lot of health problems. i'm taking seven different prescriptions just to get out of bed every morning. and i just started a new one which makes me zone out a little, makes me severely dehydrated, and makes it unsafe for me to drive (i do anyways #brokegirlproblems).

i did, of course, warn all my coworkers that i started a new med and about all the side effects, and they've all been really supportive, and really pushing for me to get healthier. awesome people. except r. she and i have always gotten along until today, which is probably why it hurt so much. so. there i am, making pretty small mistakes, and every. single. time. r yells at me.

*forgets to throw away a bit of plastic*
r: hey dumb fuck come throw this away
m: sorry r it slipped my mind.
r: you've been working here for too long to fuck up like this, you dumbass.
m: i know -
r: if you know better, then stop fucking up.

that's literally almost a word-for-word recall of what happened today. and that happened dozens of times every hour. nothing i was doing was good enough for her. i started to get annoyed. my ""i know""s got more frustrated. and then she yelled at me for changing my gloves when they got too sweaty because we had a line. and i snapped. i straight up walked out.

i didn't quit. i was at the door when common sense slapped me in the face and i went to the managers' office. i started telling my manager about it and i got so angry i just started bawling. y'all. i was a horrible sobbing mess. i sat on the floor and fetal positioned until i could control my emotions. and my manager just sent me to the breakroom until i could compose myself.

ten minutes later she sent me back because there was a line (even though there's three other workers). now, six hours into my shift, i have made it to my first actual break. i don't know how i'll survive the next three hours.

567,no colored pens update,"so, a while ago i posted about a ‘no colored pens rule’ at my work. if some didn’t see it i’ll make it short and sweet, retelling it now: i work at a senior ‘independent’ living home. by ‘independent’ i mean these people can cook, clean, drink (we have a bar) drive, work out, etc except they’re just old and live in a senior home. this place is extremely a “you get what you pay for” kinda place, rich and sorta snobby old folks. anyways, after eating a meal, they get a little slip to sign and when i served them, i would give them a colored pen. they would always get pretty excited, asking “what color do i get to use today?!?” with a big smile on their face. unfortunately, my old boss came up to me one day and said i could no longer use said colored pens. i asked why. he said that someone ‘complained’. why would someone complain? he replied with “an anonymous person said that colored pens represented the rainbow which also represents lgbtq and they don’t support that. so no more colored pens.” i was completely shocked. it’s been about a year since then and this is my update. the seniors still ask me where my colored pens are. they actually seem disappointed i don’t have them. my co-workers would even steal them cuz they liked using them too, and when they asked why we couldn’t use them anymore, they all were pretty pissed and offended. my whole building, not just the dining room, is only allowed to use black or blue pens.

568,my manager stopped a fight between an entitled asshole and a paying customer.,"i’m a host at a popular sports bar and grill, it was a busy saturday night, and a guy came in and asked for a table for 2. i told him it’s gonna be like a 15-20 minute wait. he didn’t like that, he almost started yelling at me because there were open tables and i wasn’t seating anyone. 

side note to all those who have never hosted before: just because tables are open doesn’t mean you should seat them, especially on a busy night, servers get irritated if they have 3 tables that just got sat in their section, it’s hard to manage. 

anyway, back to the story, this guy finally has had enough of trying to persuade me to let him cut the line and says he’s going to sit at the bar. fine, whatever, the bar is seat yourselves anyway. 

we had two parties of eight in line for tables and we have two large tables that comfortably seat eight. all we were waiting on was for the server to give us the ok to seat that table, as she had just gotten sat. so without my noticing, the entitled asshole sits at the large table. so when the server gives me the ok i start to seat one of the large groups at the big tables, that’s when i see the guy at the table. 

i talk to him and say “sir you said you were going to the bar, if you would like a table you need to wait in line like everyone else.” 

this did not go well with the asshole. he says “man, i only have two people i shouldn’t have to wait in line behind the big groups” 

i calmly said “sir you are taking up a large table, and making everyone else wait longer” 

then, he said “do you know who i am?”

this, rightfully so, infuriated one of the men in the large party, and he starts yelling at the guy “idgaf who you are we have been waiting for half a f****** hour you can wait like everyone else” the server noticed the commotion and ran to fetch our manager. 

now, our manager, he’s six foot four, about 320 pounds, covered head to toe in tattoos and piercings. if you didn’t know him, you’d think he’s the scariest guy you’ve ever seen. 

my manager is practically running into the room, and throws the entitled asshole about 4-5 feet back and yells at both men to stfu. i explained the situation to the manager and he promptly threw out the asshole and apologized to the large group. super satisfying moment. 

tl;dr manager breaks up fight after entitled asshole seats himself

569,the story of the wasted old man,"i apologise in advance if this story doesn't fit here. i'll gladly move it someplace else.

near the end of last summer, i was volunteering at a cultural festival organised by my community. the way it was set up, you had different people and businesses from said community with their own stands where they could greet customers and do whatever it is they wanted. my main jobs were helping out at these stands if necessary, cleaning up any messes, and just doing whatever needed to be done. near the end of the day, i decided to stick around the beer garden, since there was a huge line (my community loves its alcohol) and my fellow volunteers running it were working non-stop.

i need to explain how this beer garden worked. it was a designated area within the park the festival was held in and was blocked off with those short temporary metal security fences. after waiting in line, you would go up to a tented square booth to pay in cash for a ticket of a specific colour, which indicated what drink you wanted (eg.: pink for beer, green for a cocktail, etc.). you would then go to the right side of the booth where the “bar” was, hand over your ticket, and get your drink.

this might baffle you, but i had no experience whatsoever in serving or making drinks. i don’t like beer and am not much of a drinker. therefore, i thought it wise to stick to restocking the coolers and putting away the empty bottles. however, one of the volunteers there, who i guess wanted to go on a break, thought it was as good a time as any to show me the ropes (i swear, his face lit up when i said i had no experience). so after observing him and the other “bartenders”, i started trying to pour and prepare the drinks as best as i could alongside one other volunteer. i thought it was a bad idea, but they were shorthanded and i figured the guy next to me would take over if things weren’t going smoothly.

in comes the old man, who seemed to be normal at first. he wanted a beer, so i opened one and started pouring it into a cup. unfortunately, i hadn’t yet mastered a way to prevent the beer from foaming, and as a result, i was trying to empty it out without it spilling over. eventually, the old man took the bottle from me and did it himself, saying with a slight condescending smile that he’ll be getting all the beer he paid for. fair enough, i wasn’t supposed to be doing this anyway, i made a mistake and promised myself i would do better. one of the volunteers there asked me what had happened, so i told her, and we had a bit of a laugh. as i observed the old man walking away with his drink, i noticed that his walk was a little off, but i got back to work, thinking i’d never see him again.

guess who showed up about an hour later. we were all looking at him as he was trying to buy a ticket with the swiftness of a sloth, looking through all his pockets to find any spare change he could (by that point, it seemed like he had almost run out). the two girls who were working the cash register at that moment hadn’t seen the way he had acted before, so they must have thought he was just a bit slower in movement, and gave him his ticket. as he made his way to the bar, he saw me and immediately went to my co-volunteer for his drink. he then tried to leave, but suddenly swayed and had to hold one of the booth’s support rods to stabilise himself. someone called security, who told this man to sit down. this angered the old man, and i shit you not, he proceeded to grab the security guard like a kangaroo when it’s about to box its opponent. the sg was having none of it and forced him to take a seat a bit further away from our booth. we also gave the old man a water bottle to hopefully help him sober up a little; however, he disappeared some twenty minutes later. the old man became a topic of conversation for us at the booth, and my co-volunteer said that the man had shoved him when he tried helping him (i didn’t see this happen because i was too busy). so by then we all knew not to serve that man anymore, and figured that was that.

except it wasn’t. forty minutes later, the old man showed up yet again, this time absolutely plastered, and was sluggishly making his way towards the cash register. i immediately intervened and told him politely but firmly that we cannot serve him any drinks. his barrel of a brain slowly registered what i said, and he turned to two other girls who were there to ask *them* for his sweet, precious beer. worried that this guy would get aggressive again, i ran to get the manager and told her everything that had happened. she came back with me and told him to leave.

old man (slurring): and who are you?

manager: i am the one in charge of this booth. we kindly ask you to leave, there’s no more beer (this was a lie to hopefully discourage him; by that point it had gotten dark, the park was almost empty and there were no more customers).

the old geezer then had the gall to laughingly ask the two girls if they would give him beer if the manager weren’t there (obviously not). we wanted to get rid of this guy and start cleaning everything up, but we learned that security had left. basically, we were stuck with this drunken old man, we were sure he was alone, we knew he couldn’t be sent on his way, and he still wanted a drink. we tried to get him to sit down, but he kept resisting. he would say things like: “oh, that chair is probably being used by someone else” or “if i sit down, you'll call the police, won't you?”

as we were trying to work the situation out, he teetered away from our booth while holding on to the metal fences, and swayed so far to the right that i can’t believe he didn’t fall and crack his skull. i ran to him to try and help, but he turned to me, all confused.

old man: what are you doing here? (he said this in a tone close to “the hell do you want from me?”)

me: i came to help you because you almost fell.

old man: …who almost fell?

me (in bewilderment): *you* did, sir. how about… how about you go take a seat on the bench over there, okay?

old man: no, i… i want to sit on this chair right here.

he was pointing at thin air. the guy was so drunk, he was apparently seeing chairs.

me: there is no chair here, sir. the closest seat is just over there, alright?

he finally wobbled away, and that’s the last i saw of him.

i sadly do not have the conclusion to this story, because i had to leave shortly after to get home, and it was already around 9 pm by then. i also didn’t get a chance to speak to my fellow volunteers, so i don’t know what happened to the old man. my guess is that the people in charge eventually called the police and he either got taken away for the night or driven home. i have a small theory that he had bought some drinks at the booth before i went to work there, since his walk was unsteady the first time i saw him. anyway, if my community does organise another festival like that this year, we’ll need to find a way to moderate the number of drinks being sold to people to avoid situations like these. i’ll make sure to bring it up if i hear about any plans.

&amp;#x200b;

edit: tl;dr. an old man who had possibly already had drinks before i met him kept coming back to the booth i was helping out at for beer, got aggressive with a security guard and a volunteer, then refused to sit down and stop asking for drinks, almost falling to the ground in the process.",MayYouFindPeace,tfys
570,i love my job. i hate my job.,"some nights i go in and bartend or serve and think ""wow, this is fun. people are great, i'm being social and making money. this job is a win-win!

572,question: did i get audited last night?,"hey folks, not sure if i'm allowed to ask this here but there is a story attached and i'm a little worried. 

story:

last night i was working dinner service and was sat a 4-top. a middle aged couple and their adult kids. everyone orders drinks and i, being in the middle of a friday night rush, neglect to id the two younger two since they both seemed around the 25 mark (but i could have been wrong). 3 of the 4 order mixed drinks while the 4th, the daughter asks if we have ""ice"" (you know the sugary, vodka cooler i mean) which we do. i bring their drinks and all is well until the end of the meal when the dad complains about the daughter's food on her behalf. she'd eaten less than half of it so i discounted half that plate from the bill and everyone left happy. that was my interaction with these folks. they all only ordered one drink each, everyone enjoyed them, or so i thought.

when i got around to clearing their table i found the girl's completely full can of cooler behind our table topper (it was a booth so the can was between the topper and the wall). she had been drinking what i guess was water from the pint glass i'd brought with the cooler. the can itself looked fulll enough where she either had a small sip then set it aside or never drank any of it to begin with.


question:

in my province they are apparently cracking down on venues not properly iding and we were warned that audits would start happening (18yo and younger people sent in to try to buy alcohol). 

so now i'm worried that this was an audit, because the only way you really know is if you fail and they fine you and your workplace. i mean, why else would a younger person order a drink someone else was paying for and not drink it?

anyone have experience with this?",Raddlersnake,tfys
573,weird gut feeling,"disclaimer for any errors.  


so for context, i started my restaurant career in at a korean bbq place where i went up the ranks e.g. trainee, busboy for 1 week mandatory, server, head server, captain (assistant manager) &amp; finally manager. i worked at that kbbq for about 5 years, 2.5 years spent as manager and traveling to manage the other restaurants that the owner had.   


after working there i had my fair share of finding, quitting, finding, etc. at other places. recently a colleague of mine that i trained at said kbbq restaurant recruited me and had my interview with the new owner. i say, new, because he bought 85% of the restaurant from his younger brother.   


so during the interview, the new owner, e, and i discussed that he's hiring me specifically as a manager- cool. i came in regardless only wanting to be a manager. we made a conclusion that i will be making $xxxx/month biweekly working 4 full days weekly (10-12 hour shift).   


now the whole gut feeling comes into play from last night. i was the closer and found it strange that i was put into a section to serve, no biggie. but my colleague was frustrated because we had to serve. us serving means that the other servers loose about 12 tables collectively, since him and i were watching 6 tables whereas everyone else was watching 3 tables. price per head is $25 w/o alcohol orders so a minimum if we were to just say a 2 top comes, they are only able to push $30 per 3 tables of 2's for every rotation. my friend and i were pushing close to $90/hr but we were both in the weeds as we kept getting double sat. 

&amp;#x200b;

the owner wanted to do all the hosting stuff, but not allow me and my colleague to actually manage and do customer/employee support if that makes sense. i also found out that the reason why the owner wants us to serve is because he wants to use our tips to help fund our salaries lol. never worked at a restaurant where they use our tips to help fund our salaries.

just want to know what you guys think of the situation!

574,over 500 dollar tip,"due to being anonymous i am not going to reveal their actual last name, but there was a family that would come in every sunday at the restaurant i’d work at. this family was extremely wealthy and every server knew it. it got to the point to where every time they would come in, the servers would put all of our waitresses names in a cup and draw who got their table. normally they would tip around 85 dollars for a buffet which is just an insane tip. 


so when the hen family came in that sunday. one of the waitresses drew from the cup and it ended up being my turn to wait on the table. to make things uncomplicated, at the table there were four people, the mom, dad, their daughter and then the daughters husband. now the daughter had the best style. every time they would come in, she was always dressed in the cutest outfits that i’m sure i could only dream of owning. so as i was seating them, i turned to the daughter and said something like “i just want to say that every time you come in, you dress so cute. i love your sense of style”. when i complimented her she just blushed and was like oh thank you, no ones ever told me that before. it genuinely made her day and i was happy that it had. 


so meanwhile i ended up going to check on my other tables and the daughters father went up to me and said “i hope you know that compliment meant the world to my daughter and i’ve never seen someone make her that happy” and he then proceeds to hand me 100 dollars... i was so shocked so i was like are you sure? but he wouldn’t let me not accept it so i took the money and kept working. i assumed he just handed my tip to me early but boy was i wrong. 


once they finished their meal, i had left them the check to which they had to go up to the waitress box to pay with either card or cash. when the dad went up to the box, he then left another tip which was 400 dollars. i didnt find out about it till the waitress that cashed him out had went up to me and showed me how much he had left. even when i went back to the table to clear it, i saw that the daughter had left 40 dollars as a tip for me. it’s safe to say that all of the other waitresses were pissed because of how much he left me. 


they would keep asking me how did you get them to tip you that much. which i would just reply by saying that i gave his daughter a compliment and was genuine. after this day, the family never really came back in but when they did they never tipped as much as they used too. it’s crazy how much you can affect one persons day by giving them a compliment :)",reddituser10134,tfys
575,got tipped $30 on a $600 check.,"just got home. served a large group of men from england. everything went fine for the most part. most of them tipped ~10% or less. several of them tipped nothing. 

i know some people are opposed to tipping, and if you are please don't come to a full service restaurant. tips are paying your server for their service. if you don't believe in paying for service, don't get serviced. 

of course there's the ""people don't tip in europe"" argument. we're not in europe. if i was in england, i would be expected to act in accordance to english social norms. i don't understand people from any country who think is is fine to visit another country and act however.

579,the sermon of the janet,"this is genuinely one of the weirdest experiences that i have ever had as a waitress, and i've been doing this for a while. i never thought that something like this would happen to me (and i've dealt with threats, catcalls, and the like), but it's definitely something that i will never forget. 
 
anyway, this episode will definitely be titled: the sermon of the janet-as named by janet herself. 

for some background information, i work in a relatively small trucker style diner that's pretty family friendly. i was working the night shift (5-10, which is when we close) with two other closers c and m, our manager d, and one of our new hires s. about ten minutes to close, all of us are trying to finish up our other tables who were eating when in waltzes janet. she sits down and immediately begins talking to c, who came over to get her drink order. c takes her drink order while janet talks her ear off, beginning with the day she was born to her move to new hampshire, which was taking place that day. c takes her food order. c leaves. janet keeps going. 

that wasn't the only disturbance janet caused that night.  janet also: 

-disturbed every other table by going up to talk to them. (most of the other customers just stared at us, concerned). 
-went up to the aa regulars and begin to tell them stories about when she used to be a part of this specific aa group when she was still active and that she knew many of the people at the table. the aa table tried to humor her, but most of them would tell m later that they had never met her before nor ever seen her at one of the meetings. 

-began talking to s about how she saw him last year when she came to our restaurant. some issues with that: 1) s had only started a week ago 2) s was not originally from the area and had moved recently from very far away. 3) we had never, ever seen this lady at our restaurant before in our lives. 
c brings out janet's food. s and i, snickering over the ridiculousness of the lady, went into the back to let janet eat her food in relative peace. 

now, at this moment, i don't know what happened, but i would like to think that it was some sort of epiphany. while s and i were in the back, getting supplies to continue to close up the restaurant, m begins to tell us a story about how she bounced back from a hard time. m continues to go on, stating that she believes that god reveals himself in mysterious ways (for those who are non-religious, suspend your disbelief for a moment) and that in her case, a ragged man came to her in the laundromat to tell him about how even after he lost his two kids in a car accident, and he was living paycheck to  paycheck to take care of his disabled wife, he realized that there were never any bad days, but only bad moments. m then ended by stating that this woman, while acting crazy, might be here to impart some wisdom or some other fortune upon us. 

s and i exchange glances, roll our eyes, and went back out to the dining room, where we see c talking to janet. next thing we know, janet is beginning her sermon, telling us how she was born and raised in philadelphia, only to become addicted and homeless by her 18th birthday. she was saved from her addiction only by the work of father vince, a priest who would often come into the slums of camden and philadelphia to help get drug addicts off the streets and into rehabilitation. she had nothing, and through the intervention of the aa group she joined (the same one that meets in the restaurant), she was able to buy a house, which she recently sold. she survived drug addiction, poverty, and an abusive relationship and now she is selling her house and moving to new hampshire, which is what she always wanted to do. she seemed incredibly happy, even going as far as tipping everyone who was working in the restaurant at the moment 10 dollars. as my manager began to make the final call for the cash register, she laughed and said that my manager shouldn't interrupt the sermon she was giving us, and aptly described it as the sermon of the janet.

581,scam artists allowed to take over dining room.,"on mobile. 

so last night i got to work and someone was talking about these folks who were hosting something and were going to have people showing up and different times during the night. so after doing some digging and asking around come to find out it was a group of folks trying to sell time shares. they just came into the restaurant asked for several tables for the entire night and had all these elderly people coming in for a free meal and a time share spiel. 

y’all it was disgusting and sad to watch, this rag tag group of very unprofessional looking jerks inviting these very elderly folks to try to scam them and our managers allowed them to do it. i am so disappointed in my managers at the moment.  at one point the main scam artist tried to approach a random table not there for the setup, she even brought her huge old ass printer she had all set up on a table like it was her office.

582,guy demands a manager bc i won’t accept his hole-punched id,"on mobile sorry if formatting is off! 

i work at a wine bar at a theme park in socal where we’re pretty strict about ids, and this happened yesterday to me. 

it was super busy (my line was out the queue and going into our patio area) and we’re really short staffed so at this point i was the only one serving with one bar back. guy comes up and orders two beers. i ask for his id and he hands me his driver’s license that has a hole-punch in it. for those that don’t know, hole-punch = invalid id. i ask him if he has another form of identification because i cannot accept his hole-punched id. he pulls out his temporary dmv paper and tells me that he’s waiting for his new id to arrive in the mail. 

guy will be g and i’ll be me.

me: i’m so sorry but unfortunately our alcohol policy prohibits us from accepting temporary dmv papers for alcohol purchases. 

g: are you kidding me? it’s just a hole-punch and clearly states my age, why can’t you take it????

me: the hole-punch makes it invalid and we can only accept valid forms of id for alcohol. 

g: but i’m 28 years old!! it says so right here!! 

me: i know sir, but it’s not a valid id. 

g: this is ridiculous i want to talk to a manager right now

so my bar back goes to get a manager. 

i asked the guy to move to the side so i could continuing serving other guests that were waiting in line but nope he just stays right in front of my register while my line is getting out of control. i think screw this guy and move my fund to an empty register at the other end of the bar so i can continue serving guests. the guy gives me a look and i just ignore him. 

my manager finally comes out and tell the guy the exact same thing i told him. i can hear him arguing with her “this is ridiculous! i’m 28 years old!” “tell me where it says i can’t buy alcohol with this!!” this goes on for another minute and finally the guy just angrily stomps off. 

moral of the story, carry proper valid id when wanting to buy alcohol! 

edit: i didn’t realize it was different in other states but if california a temporary id is only valid for driving it says so right at the bottom of the paper. ",Justatrowaway5446,tfys
583,we are ready...to waste your time.,"a short one, need to get it out of my chest. 

i work at a coffee shop. this group arrives at 6pm, i hand the menus and they say they are gonna wait for someone to arrive. 7:15 rolls and the person  hasn't arrived yet, they get tired of waiting so they call me to order. when i arrive to the table and ask for their order you know what they do? they grab the menus for the first time and proceed to take 10 minutes(with me in front of them) to sort what they want. 

why are some customers like this? they can be taking their sweet time to do nothing, but as soon as they feel the urge to order they have to do it now and cannot wait.

i come back and they took all the papers. left me nothing. it's extremely infuriating to know that my table couldn't even afford the tab itself let alone tip. 

most people who don't want to wrack a high tab don't order drinks, which they did. they also go two items instead of just sharing something which is usually what people do when they're cheap. and they both had left overs so they could have done it. just dumb dummies...

i used to work at this cafe and after i left i still kept in touch with people there. one of my friends recently resigned from the cafe. she had intended to leave early march, but they asked her to stay another week because of a lack of staff, and she agreed. 

a week later, the manager calls her and asks her to come in for a day because they're short-staffed. she agrees cus she's chill. we talked about this and i was strongly against her working for an extra day. 

she's ok with it because it's no big deal and she's not particularly busy too. myself, i've got somewhat of a grudge against the cafe because they used to take us employees for granted and imo this just highlights that more. so i was a bit pissed they were doing it again.

586,to latte or not too latte,"this happened a few years ago now when i was working as a barista at a café/restaurant

an elderly lady come up to the counter and ordered a ""cappuccino with no chocolate on the top"". it was a slow day so i took the time to explain to the new waitress waiting to deliver the coffee how this order is basically a latte because, unless you order from a high class professional barista, you'll be getting roughly the same amount of coffee, milk, and froth in both a latte and capp (about a 1/3 each), but a capp has chocolate and a more domed top. 

the waitress took the coffee to the lady and explained what i just told her. this woman was having none of it. according to her, i am completely wrong. she can't stand the taste of lattes as they ""blend the milk and coffee the wrong way"". she took a sip and was convinced it was a latte, so she asked for me to make another one. so i did. exactly the same as i did before. and she drank the whole thing and loved it.

588,the crying man - the story that developed as i typed it,"this literally just happened. i work in a food truck with family and today had been a rather okay day. closing in less than an hour as it had been rather quiet. manning the window like i usually do as i wait for customers, suddenly hearing a car that is parked in front of us reeving its tires. just having his foot on the pedal while, his car was in parked and his tires screeched on the pavement. i thought it was bizarre but, just went back to looking at my phone, thinking nothing much of it. 

the tire screeching stops after a good minute and the door opens, looking up, i see a man exit the car before he walks towards our food truck. well, walk is being generous as the man stumbles his way to our truck, almost tripping twice. we have had customers who have had a bit to drink or having just smoked some weed so it was nothing new but, the man stopped at our table and just started crying. he was leaning on the table outside and sobbing uncontrollably. stumbling forward towards the order window before just crying right there on his knees.

i had never seen this before so i have no fucking clue what to do, immediately getting the attention of my mother/boss and brother as they hadn't even noticed the man and i don't know how to handle this. explaining to them that some random, possibly drunk, guy is having an episode and crying in front of the window. they try to get the guys attention and talk to him, find out what is going on with my mom offering him a taco or something with him asking for a burrito. still crying as he can barely get a sentence in before calming down slowly, the guy just sobbing as the only coherent thing he says is ""his family"" and ""oh my god"". my mom giving the guy the burrito as she just wanted him to leave, worried he might harm himself or us. the guy in his state decided to rip the necklace off his neck before giving it to us as payment. 

a group of men came to order as they discussed between themselves but, this guy just suddenly became irate and started yelling at the men. at first, the men think this guy's is joking around, having a bit to drink but, is just trying to funny. that changes when he begins telling my brother to hand him the gun before suddenly attempting to hit one of the men and pushing another as they decide to quickly leave, with two other people who were walking over to order leaving as well. the man stays behind as he just yells obscenities after obscenities at the customers he had just driven away who are now long gone. how he is a goddamn american citizen. fuck your mother this. fuck you. fuck yourself. anything with fuck, this guy probably said twice.

an ambulance and firetruck arrive, someone probably having called earlier due to this man's car reeving with a paramedic talking to the man. they leave rather quickly though as the man seemingly went into the store. that is when i begin to type out this story for reddit. telling my friends over telegram about this strange man. we thought it might be the end of it.

as i typed the story, i heard my brother say that the police showed up. looking up, i saw a cop car park behind the man who was now back in his car. the officer getting out of his cruiser to speak with the man, the moment the officer gets to the car door, the man just books it. smashing the pedal as he just bailed the parking lot, scaring as all as we thought he would drive straight into our truck since he was parked in front of us. the officer yelling at him to stop before running back to his cruiser, beginning to chase this man as he drove away.

a few minutes pass as we just talk about what happen and look at the necklace this man just left us, who swore it was it pure gold and valuable. my mom deciding to get into her car to quickly see what is happening as the blue lights are still visible down the street, coming back to us as she said how the police had the man cornered with their guns drawn due to him refusing to exit his car. 

after talking with an employee of the gas station who came out as a police cruiser entering the parking lot before turning on their siren immediately got their attention. my mom was just scared by this man, deciding to say fuck it and leave early. staying behind a bit as some customers came to order, making up for the group this man scared away before we officially left. driving away from our spot, we could see now a cruiser was still with the man's car as a tow truck began to take it away. now, we're just driving to leave the truck before heading home. this day just ending with a fucking bang.

i'm sorry if this story sounds i rushed or sloppy, the adrenaline from a bizarre and nerve-wracking event is still in me as i typed this out.

tl;dr - possibly drunk guy comes crying to us. scares away customers during his state. police arrive and he bails.

edit - made some changes and added some details that i forgot or didn't know about such as meaning food truck not an actual truck, the reason the gas station employee came, and what happened between the group he scared away. ",Littleboypurple,tfys

590,teenie bopper busboys,"i want to rant for a moment and i'm wondering if other people have it similarly. 
last night we had a fairly normal thursday dinner shift, not too crazy. our italian themed restaurant has 4 big dining rooms and a bar, i was in the party room last night and i was getting parties of 6 to 10 people.
the bus boys at our place are unfortunately known for being lazy af. 
they don't want to do their jobs! and argue with people when asked to do something that is already their job!!! i had a full blown argument with one dude weeks ago cause i asked him to get some cups after grabbing two from dish while i was running to get drinks for one table and greet another, this teenager berated me for not grabbing the cups myself while i was back there. 
oh and we are forced to tip them out at the end of the night. 
so last night a (different) busser started breaking down the back servers station a few minutes before 8:30. we close at 10. 
i am still expected to give great service, now fighting for things in the front side station with the rest of the servers. 
i asked this little twerp to stop, i was plenty cordial at first, and he looks at me and says he has somewhere to be and ""things don't always go the way we want to"" with that squinty fake smug smile. 
so i go to the manager and calmly ask her to speak with the bus boy. she does and i go take care of my tables, but! i come back to the side station and he's still pouring things out and chucking shit away even as i grab for it. 
so i go to my manager again, i'm getting frustrated, it shows. she goes again to talk to him.
i'm also dealing with a difficult table and this is all so ridiculous, why is other staff making a night that would be easily handled into a mess?
i walk back and again he is still breaking shit down!!! what! 
he tries to talk to me but i full on ignore him and give up the issue, guess i'm just shit out of luck.
later, oh about 20 to 30 mns, we have another party of 15 sat, me and the server i split it with. but guess what folks? they got so much shit comped from their bill! cause everything took so long, cause even though it was 9 fuckin oclock, we had nothing in our side station. 

tldr; a brat of a fuckin busser left me and others high and dry by cleaning our side station an hour and a half before we close, despite the manager twice telling him to stop. 

what i don't get! is how the fuck does this kid have a job? i was under the impression that directly ignoring two orders would get your ass fired. 

are other people's managers so spineless? anyone else's bus boys be more useful as a door stop?

tonight we had a party of 7 that came at 8:45 and every worker knew what was going to happen and appeared frustrated. being the new guy i was asked to take the table which i'm not too accustomed to doing since i often don't take large parties. wow, this party was difficult, one lady asked about msg in the food, i checked with the other workers who were huddled in a group nearby probably talking nicely about this party and asked them if the items the customer inquired to had msg, they said they didn't. i went back informed the customer but was rebutted with ""well the last time i was here this item did have msg."" i felt like responding ""is this a test?"" if you already knew then why would you ask about it? i said i'd double check to make sure and a guy said ""triple check,"" what a bad ass. my co workers then informed me only one option didn't have msg which was infuriating since that person could have been allergic and i looked like an idiot giving the customer wrong information. many of their party members made ridiculous requests and returned some items that ""tasted bad."" that had to be the most despised party the place had ever seen in my time there.

i had a 4 top sit at lunch one day and i do my usual “can i start y’all off with something to drink?” and one lady says “can we see a bottle list? sorry, bottles list. we’re gonna be having several bottles.” in my head i’m like “okay it’s noon on a wednesday but whatever, who am i to judge.”

so i bring the bottle list and they order two bottles of sparkling rosé. good start, whatever, it’s probably a birthday or something. they order their food and seem to be enjoying everything. towards the end of the meal i come up and everyone is crying. i always get awkward when customers are crying but they decided to open up to me. the oldest lady at the table points to a bracelet she’s wearing and told me to read it out loud. i look and it says “fuck cancer”. i kind of laughed because it’s in my nature not to say the word fuck at a table. she says “really, read it out loud for me.”

i end up saying it and she tells me to read it again, louder. so i do. at this point she tells me that she’s with her lunch group and they’re here for a celebration of her life. they had all done lunch together once a month for a few years and they knew this was likely their last. i tell chef and he sends out desserts on desserts on desserts. one of the guests follows me on instagram later that day and i see that she hashtagged her pictures from the day #thanks(my name here). i found out a couple months later that she did in fact pass away a few weeks after i served them.

because the restaurant is located in a small-ish town, there'd usually only be one hostess and one server on for lunch shifts, and sometimes when we'd get a lunch rush i'd help with getting drink orders and running food out and such. 

&amp;#x200b;

i went to this one table where a mother and father were sat with their two children, a boy and a girl - the girl was still a baby and the boy was probably 4 or 5 at most. it was a day or two before halloween so as i was making lighthearted conversation with the parents, i decided to ask the little boy if he was excited for halloween and candy.

&amp;#x200b;

instantly the mother and father drop their smiles and look at me very seriously. the mom starts shaking her head going, ""oh, no, no..."" already a little weird reaction, but the kicker was when this kid looks me dead in the eyes and goes, ""we don't do halloween. halloween is for heathens who don't believe in jesus."" the father nods approvingly and tells him, ""good job,"" or something, and i just scurry off to get them their drinks.

i apologize for the lengthy rant. it’s just things like this really eat at me. i’m certainly not a sexist and i hate unwarranted and false assumptions on my character. and because i’m at work there’s not much i can really do aside from say “i don’t have a problem with women.” some people really suck.

598,"‘now, would anyone like more drinks or any parmesan chee..... oh god!’","i was a waiter in a family orientated high end forest based holiday park (in the uk) working in a chain italian restaurant.
i really enjoyed the job most of the time and did exceedingly well with tips and guest mentions.
one day we had a family of 5 in my section on a 6 seater long table.
mum, dad and 3 kids. all very friendly and polite, one of those tables where you know nothing can go wrong.
everyone is happy and in high spirits (were on holiday!) except for the daughter at the end of the table. 
she looks sad, pale and is very quiet.
we do the drinks order and go straight to mains.
everything comes out in a timely fashion, it’s all looking good!
i can carry somewhere between 3-6 plates at once depending on whats ordered, and could manage four of the five dishes at once. 
the food hits the table except for the sad daughters, everyone has what they expected and are waiting for me to return with the last dish before they begin.
moments later i’m back with her pasta, i place it in-front of her and assess the amount of liquid left in each persons glass.

‘now, would anyone like more drinks or any parmesan chee.....’

then it happened. 
poor pale daughter must have had a whiff of her dinner and it turned her stomach. 
she threw up everywhere! all over her food and the table, with it splashing over the rest of the family and possibly there dinner.
there was a brief pause for a second while everyone processed what just happened.

‘would you like me to remove the food?’

the father nodded and i picked all the plates back up (could do them all at once now they could be stacked on top of each other) and headed to the back of house where the plates are scraped and prepared for the dish washer.

the manager had seen me walk past him minutes ago with plates full of food and then minutes later with the same plates going back.
he looked concerned and tried to stop me but i told him i’d explain shortly and ploughed on.
i dumped each meal in the bin with the vomit covered one last so it was visible to the manager  (they didn’t trust the staff) and rushed back to the table to clean up all the sick that was there.
daughter and mother were missing, in the bathroom cleaning her up i believe, and as i wiped down the table and disinfected everything the father apologised and said she wasn’t feeling well but they didn’t expect her to do that!
i told him not to worry, these things happen.

table was clear and clean and mother and daughter returned.
i came back and asked what we were going to do now. 
clearly no one was in the mood for eating after seeing the daughter projectile vom so they decided to call it a day and take her back to the villa and eat there. 
the father stated he was happy to pay for the meals.

i told him i’d see what i could do.

went back to the manager, who was obviously concerned and explain about the poor girl getting sick on her meal.
his first thoughts were ‘did everything have to be binned?!’ 
yes boss. it was all contaminated.
would they pay for there meals?
doubtful boss, they didn’t even get to try them.

he sent me back to try and get them to pay full price for the whole meal.
i didn’t wanna do that, we have a daily amount of wastage purely for incidents like this and it was no ones fault really.
i went back to the table and explained to them that i thought they should pay for the drinks only seeing as no food was consumed.
the father reiterated his ability to pay and i assured him i could convince the manager otherwise. 

went back to the boss man;
‘there not happy boss. not sure we should charge em for what they didn’t eat.’
he huffed and puffed but eventually removed all 5 meals from the bill. 

i gave them the bill which was around £20 for the drinks and they left as happy as could be under the circumstances and left a nice little tip for me too.

606,you ever see a drunk old person? they are scary,"so some background.  i work at a restaurant that also doubled as a bar. the bar was about half of the restaurant but you could also order alcohol in the actual restaurant part of the place. it's also worth noting that it is up to the discretion of the **waiter** to cut someone off from alcohol, not the bartender, since the bartenders couldn't really see outside of the bar to the customers tables. they could, however, see how much alcohol a table has ordered. 

**this is important**

one night a lovely old couple walks into the restaurant and asks for a table for two. both customers look, more or less, around 75 years old, a man and a woman. these two sit down, order some small order of appetizers, and a lot of drinks. the word ""egregious"" does not come close to describe the amount of booze they order. these two proceed to drink like it was the end of the world. they weren't drinking light stuff either. they drunk all the strong stuff. wine? yup. whiskey? you bet. tequila? sure. vodka? absolutely. they were going shot for shot with each other. 

note: i, and the rest of the staff, were told this by the waiter, who was observing them do this. the reason this mad man continued serving them alcohol has yet to be determined (considering this happened 5+ years ago, we may never know). but eventually the waiter cut them off.

but it was too late.

they were gone. it was a miracle that these two didn't fall over on the spot. the husband of this dynamic duo decides to make a quick stop at the nearest restroom. he's in there for no longer than 2 minutes. they eventually leave, literally almost carrying each other. they told the hostess that they ordered a taxi and that there was no reason to worry about them driving home. so they left in their taxi (which we made sure they got in). not even a minute after they left we found out about two things. 

1) when that man went to the bathroom, he vomited everywhere. floor, walls, f\*\*king ceiling, everywhere but the toilet. you know that scene from daddy day care? where the kid shits in the bathroom? it's like that.

2) as the two of them left, the lady left us a little present on the floor. a dude came up to the hostess and said, ""uh, are dogs allowed in here?"" they were, but no one had a dog with them at the moment. even so, not many people bring dogs to the restaurant since it was an indoor place and no one wanted their dog shitting on the floor.

long story short, this drunk old lady straight up shit on the floor. a fully formed human turd. on the floor of a restaurant. it sounds like a scene from a dumb and dumber movie. but in real life. 

needless to say most of the customers left after they found out (it was a fairly small place so we couldn't really hide it). some poor bus boy had to clean up the vomit and poop off the floor. i tipped him extra that day. ",Randomly2,tfys

608,the church group,"i work at a small middle eastern themed restaurant and i typically close the restaurant quite frequently.

the day i dread closing the most (along with my managers) is wednesday.

why wednesday?

well on wednesdays the restaurant is accustomed to serving a group of individuals we call the church group. and boy are they a pain in my gaping asshole.

on wednesdays the restaurant closes at 10, and we can typically expect the church group to walk in around anywhere from 9:00 - 9:50. usually closer to the 9:30/9:45 mark. they stumble in with a group ranging from 4 people to 8 with 3 very regular people. the most consistent of which is the church pastor.

as soon as they come in one of the individuals grabs a cookie from our desert display and proceeds to eat it without telling me that they grabbed a cookie. i’m used to this behavior and i’ve learned to just accept it. the next annoying thing they do is they sit down and all order coffee or tea. you might be thinking that it’s super simple to make, and not all that labor inducing to drink very common beverages.

but they drink a pot. each.

so not only am i constantly refilling these peoples beverages, they are consistently highly demanding and in need of something at all times. 

one person whom i shall call bernie is an avid racist commonly using racial slurs and is usually the loudest talker in the group.

bernie is an ass and a half. he orders an extremely custom order that is not at all acceptable for a typical customer, but my managers allow it to maintain their business. a lot of times bernie orders a pizza and asks me to make sure that the pizza is burned. if i give bernie the pizza and it is not black, he refuses to accept it and asks for another. this usually causes an argument with the line cook and myself as throwing the pizza in the toaster a bunch sometimes and usually results in a fire. but bernie does not eat his pizza if it is not charred to a crisp.

bernie also likes to order soup. if you can already guess, he is not okay with our normal soup. i have microwaved this mans soup for 5 mins in a microwave at a time, and every time i bring his soup to him he refuses to eat it bc it is too cold. i have to wear oven mitts to get this damn soup out of the microwave. 

trust me, the soup is hot.

now you may be thinking i’m being nit-picky and just complaining about somewhat minor annoyances in the service industry.

these fucks consistently stay past close and will not leave unless i coherce my manager to ask them to leave.

when all is sorted out the pastor pays for everyones meal and they say their goodbyes and what not. 

i am only then allowed to begin closing the restaurant and i typically leave an hour later than if it had not been a wednesday. 

whatever i just fucking hate those people.

tl;dr: church group comes in every wednesday at close, is consistently difficult, and i hate them.

edit: punc and typo

edit 2: they’re here!!!

edit 3: people are asking a lot if they tip, they do

the pastor pays for everyones meals, and is a decent tipper, usually anywhere from 15% to 20%, with his thick ass metal credit card

610,should i quit?,"hi tfys!


long time reader, first time poster. tl;dr at the bottom. 


i've been working my first serving job (so forgive me if i'm totally off base here) for the past year and everything was great until about 2 months ago. it's a small, fairly busy restaurant own by an older couple, and since its small we just have a 3 servers, but no bussers or hostesses, and we all tend to help each other out with tables. because of this we have a tip pool that includes all the servers and is based off hours worked that day. 


one of our waiters who has been there for a while and is a family friend if the owners recently and transitioned to a more supervisor/office role where they also spend time making the menus, updating the website, and ordering/organizing inventory but also still help out with serving when they are scheduled. however in the past few months this coworker has been spending most of their time in the office and less than a quarter of their shift on the floor serving. the problem is that they are still included in the tip pool for that entire day. so basically if they were scheduled for a 6 hour shift but they spent 4 hours in the office they still got their full 6 hours worth of tips. some days they work spend their entire shift in the office. 


this frustrated my other coworker and i because we had to pick up the slack from not have three people on the floor and then still had to split tips evenly. last week we suggested to our owners that if the actual serving hours were not going to be equal be probably should not keep splitting tips evenly anymore. they immediately got very angry and defensive about us wanting to change how the tip pool worked. they said that our coworker was till doing his work as a server and his work in the office helped us servers do our jobs so they should still get tips for that. we ended the conversation with a tentative plan on how we can split tips more fairly.


however, when i worked last weekend the restaurant owners were very obviously still angry with my co worker and i and were acting very cold and snapping at us for very minor things. i tried to initiate the conversation again because their obvious anger was making me uncomfortable and affecting my work with the customers. they pulled me aside at one point and yelled at me over somethings very minor (i.e. i didn't bus my table fast enough or a table was waiting too long for a drink refill) which really upset me. they ended up apologizing later that day and said that they had handled this situation poorly. they want to have a meeting with everyone so sort this out and come up with a fair solution to the tip distribution. i thought we were moving past this because i really really liked this job. however, they just cut my hours for next week by half with no explanation and they want to schedule the meeting for next month. they also cut my coworkers hours so we are basically working opposite schedules. so obviously, they are still mad. 


the thing is that i am already leaving this job in 2 months, which they know, because i am moving. i was hoping that this was going to be a simple conversation that would both benefit me and whoever they hired after me but it has devolved into a very uncomfortable work environment and passive aggressiveness from my bosses. at this point i'm ready to quit right now  with how they are acting and treating my coworker and me. i'm just not sure what else to do



tl;dr: my bosses at the small restaurant i work at became angry when i pointed out that our tip pooling system was not fair and are now angry with me, acting passive aggressively, and cutting my hours. should i quit?

611,tifu by sharing my dark sense of humor with a table,"i was waiting on a group of ten elderly people today, regulars where i work. a few of them were having birthdays, and i noticed the humorous birthday cards their friends had given them. i decided to tell how my dad had loved stuff like that, and his favorite was one he'd sent to his brother: it featured an old photo of a taciturn family, one of whom was holding a vase. the outside of the card said something like, ""guess which of these people is the oldest?"" and the inside said, ""the one in the urn."" afterward (actually, about halfway through the story; don't know why it didn't occur to me to stop and say, ""sorry, this might not be appropriate,"" like i usually would), i started to worry, because not everyone appreciates that kind of dark humor.

612,"""my dead mother always sat back here""","i work at a 24 hour diner in a sketchy town. 

when i say sketchy, i mean sketchy! this place is filled with homeless drug addicts. 80% of the homeless folks we get are addicted to something and use our restrooms to shoot up, smoke, snort, etc whatever drug of choice they have. 

it's so bad we have cops driving around our place every few hours and dropping in from time to time for coffee just to make sure we're pinkie keen. 

well it's almost 4am, i've been dead for hours. i'm cleaning tables when this homeless couple come in, they want to sit at the booth next to the restroom. 

we hardly ever let homeless folks sit there because it's super easy for them to go in and out of the restrooms and hard for us to watch them since it's in a blind spot when we're on the floor. 

i, of course, tell them 
""sorry, that table is reserved. but i have many other places i can sit you,"" 
lady: ""it's fine! you know,"" cue the fake sadness ""that was my dead mother's favorite table,"" 

uh okay? thats the most bizzare thing i've ever heard anyone tell me to get a specific table but okay. 

i sit them down at this table and try to watch them, they order no food only water. the lady gets up and goes into the restroom and /props the door opened/! do you really think you're that smart? 

i waited about five minutes, had my female cheif go in and sure enough! she was smoking crack in the bathroom. she ran back to her table and tried to tell me it was someone else and not her? 

no one else is even in the restaurant aside from myself and a small group of students studying. 

i tell her and her boyfriend they need to leave, i'm not dealing with them. they call me a few choice names and leave. thankfully without much fight.

614,quit my first serving job.,"for the weirdest reason. usually in restaurants they have a space for servers to idle. at least, somewhere in the back, right? i don’t know a lot about fengshui or anything, but this restaurant was put together so horribly.

the bar was basically our idle area, where we also do most of our side work, also where customers can see us just hanging out, because we had a whole section right behind us. 

the owner didn’t want to put money down on a sealant for the concrete floor, so the grease from the food would soak in to the floor and get sticky. the chairs were squeaky and uncomfortable, and falling apart. this is a new restaurant! 

if the place was put together nicer, i definitely would have stayed. though the area/bar where we could have our ‘idle’ time was so narrow and open. obviously some customers could look at us and deem us lazy, or goofing around.

am i correct about servers usually having a space for drinks/snacks/breaks? i’m a comfort freak and i tried my hardest to stay but the set-up is horrid. ",BURRoak77,tfys
615,regular thinks they're above the rules,"i'm a waiter for a corporate chain.  we serve an all you can eat menu on some days. regardless if someone has been here before, we are supposed to tell them the all you can eat rules.  it's a little silly, but the corporation holds us liable if there is any mistake on the rules and we didn't remind the customers.  

usually i say, ""as you probably already know, you have x amount of time and must finish everything or you may be charged for remaining food from the a la carte price"".

this one customers who has been here multiple times (and is bad at following the rules, although that's irrelevant) interrupted me from saying the rules and said, i already know the rules.  i continued telling her, ""sadly i'm required to just run through them"", she interrupted me again, saying she has been here before but more forceful and unsympathetic. i calmly but pointedly say ""i'm sorry but it's my job, i have to tell you the rules"".  if she asked me why i would have said because the corporation would hold me liable in the case of any mixup on what you think the rules are, of which yes, i think it is stupid i have to make sure you know the rules, but she didn't cause she didn't care about the reason just getting her way.  i have to deal with customers wanting a table five literal minutes before the bar and kitchen close and i have to seat them because of corporate mandate.  fine but that means i'm going to hold the corporate rule that lets me cover my ass in case you're dumb and i will tell you the all you can eat rules

she speaks in spanish to the host asking for another waiter.  i go to the hostess, and i have never talked of such to another worker about a customer but tell the hostess to give that cunt to another server.  it is logged in the computer system to never give her to me which is good for both of us",Draw-on-the-walls,tfys
616,i would be fired within a week!,"so little disclaimer, i'm not a server; i am a manager in hospitality, so while i *kinda* understand what servers go through, hospitality and serving are two totally different animals. i could *never--*and have never--worked as a server, because of one thing: i'm an asshole. sure, it can make me a good manager when i stick to the rules and don't mind saying ""no"", but  that's the exact opposite of a ""good server"".

&amp;#x200b;

so, my husband and i go every week or so to our ""local neighborhood bar &amp; grill"" for our date night, because we both work late, they're open until 1:00 am on weekends, and they've got a good margarita. we almost always have the same server, who is super sweet and remembers our orders. she is honestly a big part of the reason we picked up this weekly habit. anyway, while chatting with her last week, she asked us if we'd be paying by card, and we said yes, which makes her super happy because that means we'll use those cool little tabletop terminals where we do the transaction ourselves. i know she likes us to do this because i always leave a good review for her. however, up until this point i thought she liked having us as customers because we always tip around 20-30% and were just generally easy-going and calm compared to the usual late night crowd. she explained to us this week, however, that if her employee review score drops too low, she'll lose her hours.

&amp;#x200b;

i am honestly so shocked by this. i could never imagine having to worry about my hours based nearly entirely on what my guests think of me; i'd be fired in a week! it just sounds so archaic to base an employee's worth on what the slightly drunk people think after their meal. 

&amp;#x200b;

they wanted to grab some chocolates, no problem. i grabbed them a 6 piece box and filled them with the bon bons they picked out and rang them up. they were pleasant (aside from snapping at me like a dog) up til this point.
i told them the total and as i handed the husband his card, the wife looks at me and says, “we actually work very hard so we get to have a treat today rather than stare at a screen.” all while smiling at me in a very dolores umbridge way. 

i grimaced and was just going to let it slide, but then she adds, “i’m sure working somewhere like this you can’t relate.”

this happened a few years ago and i still think it's hilarious. i was working as a hostess in the phoenix, az area at an italian food chain that gives you all the soup, salad, and breadsticks you could want. we were also known for wine. 

it was probably a friday or a saturday evening, so we were pretty busy. a woman walks in, alone. she is probably in her mid 40's. she comes to the hostess stand and gives me her name and says she reserved a table for 4 earlier in the day. i find her reservation and tell her we have her table ready. at this point, she places a cloth, reusable grocery bag on the table and i'll never forget what she said next. 

woman: ""i need you guys to do something for me please."" she pulls out a bottle of wine. ""i'm here with my mother and she always, always orders wine when we come here. she is not suppose to drink with the medication she is on, but she doesn't listen to what anyone tells her and she ends up way too drunk and hurting herself. can you tell the server to please give her this wine when she orders? it's non-alcoholic. she always gets 2 nine oz glasses of wine. also, this is for our server."" she hands me a 20. 

this was super bizarre but i asked my manager and he said it was ok. i told the lady we would be happy to accommodate her. she ran back out to the car to get the rest of her party. 

i had to go explain to the server what the woman had told me and she was perplexed. as soon as i handed her the twenty though, she shrugged and said it wouldn't be a problem. 

so, as i'm back at the hostess stand, in walks the woman, a man i'm assuming is her husband, and her mother and her father. her mother looks 85+ and she is using a walker to get around. i show them to their table and the server takes their order. sure enough, the mother orders two nine oz glasses of wine throughout the night and drinks all of it. 

when they leave, the woman runs back in alone and grabs the bottle and the bag from me, thanking us. i do not know if they charged her for the wine, i'm assuming not. but also i don't know what would have happened if the mother had seen the bill and realized her wine wasn't on there. they also tipped the waitress on the meal. all in all, they were very pleasant people, the mother just had a drinking problem 😂

throughout their meal i notice the mother and daughter are having a pretty serious discussion about something. i kind of stay away as i don’t want to eavesdrop or seem rude. i go to their table to box up their leftovers and give them the check and the daughter is sobbing and arguing with the mom. i quickly pick up the food and go to box it up. the entire time the dad is making strange comments to me about his daughter. (things like “kids huh, i don’t know how to handle having girls”) i’m a young woman myself probably only a few years older than this girl, so i think he thought i could shed light on her behavior or something. i didn’t want to get involved, so i would just awkwardly smile and nod lol. 

finally i bring them their check and the daughter asks me, in between sobs, to make her food a separate check. i nod and head back to my computer to change it. the dad walks up and hands me cash to cover the whole bill. he then proceeds to tell me about their personal family issues and how their daughter will regret not listening to them. he asks me to tell her that. he asks a random stranger serving them food to tell his daughter that she’ll regret not listening to whatever her parents say. i politely told him no, and went to inform my manager of the situation. the daughter ends up storming out crying, and the mom loudly calls her a bitch as she’s running out the door.

now a reminder, during that time he had no other tables so was only making $7.50 (wage for 2 hours) and whatever tip he got. so after the 2 hours the table racks up $700, he happily brings them the check. they pay and leave. he goes back to find they left him nothing. nada. $0.

now before people start defending them saying that usually parties over 8 people have an automatic gratuity added, unfortunately our restaurant's policy doesn't allow that. luckily we have a cool owner and he took 20% out of the check and gave it to the guy. but he could've been screwed pretty hard if he was at a different, less pleasant restaurant.",silverhammer96,tfys

we worked at a moderately upscale restaurant, at this time we had a new manager who was godawful and never protected staff from abusive guests. our gm quit &amp; we hadnt been sent a new one yet.

anyway this party of bro's comes in and starts drinking at the bar, after several rounds they move to a table. its later in the evening and the bar tender who originally served them has closed their tab and gone home so server &amp; i dont know how much they've had to drink. (i was working and witnessed some of this)


 they begin to get louder and more inappropriate as time goes on. manager wont let server cut them off or transfer them to a male server. the guys are now making sexual advances and remarks at their server. one of them asks if shes got any kids then says ""i've got about 80 million of them for you right here!"" as he gestures to his crotch with both hands. when she brings him his next beer he fist bumps her breast. one of the guys asks for a cucumber slice with his drink then proceeds to ask of she can ""take a whole one.""

they continue making lewd remarks and asking her gross personal questions like what she likes and if shes ever tried toys. she totally ignores these questions and goes to our boss to beg boss to do something but boss denies her plea &amp; tells her to just deal with it. eventually the nasty jerks left. 


 this kind of thing never happens there, it was so shocking. once gm arrived that manager didn't last long, she was so far in the wrong shes lucky coworker didnt report her to hr.",OneRunTwo,tfys
626,(mostly) illegal money,"back again with tales of my workplace, the small family-owned turk. today i'm tackling the topic of money, because oh boy. some of this is just plain illegal, and some of it is just rude marketing and trying to get people to cough up unecessarily.

first off let's discuss my pay, something i still have to come back for on friday because they sure as hell won't give it without asking. little note ahead, i was hired without contract so i have no officially discussed standards to hold them by other than national jurisdiction. my hourly pay-rate? about 2 euros under the minimumwage for horeca-workers my age. but then again sometimes they just make up numbers. they also promised me a raise somewhere some time ago, but honestly it's too much mental gymnastics with these people to go after that.

about 2/3rd of my pay is writen down legally, with a little notice of payment. the other, underpaid, 1/3rd is given to me in hand, usually during work hours. they said this would happen every 1st of the next month, but so far this has only happened twice, and the ""in-hand"" part of my cash hasn't even been given for this month. so usually i can expect this in the second week, messing up my bills that are scheduled for the first week. always late with the same excuse: ""the notary doesn't know how the system works, he's figuring things out."" i have worked there for 5 months now. if he still doesn't know how the same system works, maybe hire a new one. 

now onto the customers, who have an even shorter end of the stick than i do, since i can at least eat whatever i want free of charge at any time. their food isn't anything special or top-notch, and most of it is pretty shitty in comparison to other turks. yet somehow it is still one of the most expensive places i have seen. a simple plate of fries costs nearly triple the amount the same fries would cost at any given snackbar. as i've said in my first post about them, they also try to overprice toppings and extra's for no damn reason other than ripping customers off. i am a person with morals and ripping people off so blatantly is definitely against them.

one of the worst moral days to work is pizza/pasta day, which is my day each week. on this day all the pizza's are the same amount, except the few the are already under the set price. what they don't tell you though, is that you still pay extra for every single topping. why is this insane? well, there's a €11 pizza with shoarma on it, but also a lot of extra's. on pizza day this costs the same as a pizza with just salami and cheese on it. if the customer tells me, they want a basic pizza, but with that meat on it, the cost for the extra meat topping tops the set price, and they'll use the more expensive price, so the customer won't profit of pizza day at all, unless i find a way to write the order that it's the shoarmapizza, without literally anything else. and i'm not a fast person. to think of that order and go against the order i'm hearing is not my first course of action, although i do do it sometimes. so they'll use any excuse to cheat on their own rule unless i tell them not to. 

another extra cost never specified? we sell little saucecups that can be ordered alongside most meals for free. however this doesn't count for pizza's, but that isn't specified. so sometimes customers come in, paying euros more than they expect because they didn't factor in all those little innocent-seeming saucecups. 

just another example of how insanely expensive this place is for the shitty quality it offers: just this tuesday i saw the commercial dönerstore, with a giant ad for an entire meal (bread&amp;döner&amp;greens, with a drink and fries) for about €6.95. i have tried them, they're pretty good. where i work, the döner, salad and fries together are €11,- without any sign of a drink.

627,the deli meat saga,"so i'm not sure if this belongs here but i'm not sure of what other sub it would fit in so i'm posting it here, since i do technically serve food. this may not be the most interesting story you've ever heard but god damn is it infuriating and i have to vent about it.

so i work at a bingo hall in ontario, canada. i mainly work in the canteen area. we mostly sell snacks, but we also have soup and we make various sandwiches for the refrigerator. this is where my story begins. 

let me go back and mention that i was trained by a very strict woman who i will refer to as cl (canteen lady). cl has been working there for over 20 years and does everything in a very specific way and doesn't have a ton of patience. she would often talk to me as if i was a stupid child when i made even the smallest mistake. i brushed this off thinking that she was just passionate about her job. 

so i begin working shifts alone and everything seems to go fine, despite a few passive aggressive notes left by cl on my days off. one day i go to make the deli sandwiches for the refrigerator and i notice something troubling. all the meat in the fridge is expired by over a month. i bring this to the attention of my manager who basically just shrugs, because no one really pays attention to the canteen besides cl. a few days later i got a hold of the head manager (she isn't in everyday as we have another location she deals with) and asked her the procedure. she says the expiration date is fine because we freeze it when we get it, but afterits thawed it needs to be thrown out after 3 days. the deli meat that was currently in the fridge was there for at least two weeks, so i tossed it. as per the advice i was given, i opened a new package and labeled it ""throw out by (this date)"" which was 3 days later.

i come in for my shift today and look in the fridge. lo and behold, it's the same deli meat. but my labels were gone. i brought this up to the manager and she explained this was cl's doing. she has apparently done things like this before. i also come to learn that she literally will not listen to any manager and will continue to sell expired product until she deems it's past due despite the procedures. and on top of that, she opened a new package and didn't label when she did it. as i said, i work at a bingo hall. the majority of customers are elderly people. i am not willing risk someone's health and safety over her pettiness. so i threw out all the open meat and left her a note in return. i wonder what she's gonna say when she gets in tomorrow.",cassifrazz,tfys

629,"whats the point of ordering ""everything on the side????""","i've been in the industry for about 6 years now and there's always one phrase that irks me to no end: ""i want everything on the side."" 

what is the point of doing this? it just creates more work for the food prep, more work for the cashier's because there's no ""everything on side button,"" and more work for the expeditor because the amount of packaging it requires. this is an actual, genuine question that i have not been able to figure out. 

i've only been able to come up with 2 possible answers:

1. common stupidity/entitlement issues
2. they hate us

i'm going with 1, but hopefully you guys here can help me understand the process behind ordering that way.

edit: thank you everybody for answering! i absolutely love all the insight here! it honestly makes this task soooo much more tolerable now! i wish i would have asked earlier.

if you still have something to add, by all means go for it! i love to learn, so the more the merrier!

630,"i am a malaysian prince, will you marry me?"," sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this!

so for a summer in-between college semesters i worked at a sport's bar in a casino. my uniform was a super tight shirt and skirt, as well as being required to wear a full face of makeup. i was the hostess and it was a busy friday night. this guy comes up to me and immediately starts hitting on me.

i nicely ask him to move off to the side so i can seat other customers who are waiting. i figure that he'll get the picture if i just kinda go about my business. of course, i was wrong. when i return to the hostess stand, he's still there. and his compliments just keep getting weirder. for example, he told me my hair smelled nice and that i'm so ""nice and young"".

at this point, i nicely ask him to either let me seat him or leave. he ignores me and asks if i'm married, to which i say no. then he casually mentions that he's a malaysian prince and i since i'm not already married, i should go to malaysia with him and be his princess.

now the servers start to notice that this dude is still talking to me and they get my supervisor. my supervisor is a huge man, and he asks the guy to leave or security will be called. the guy walks off, but was still hanging around the general area in the casino, so i had to spend the rest of my shift in the kitchen.",BrokenIntoxication,tfys

633,the woes of working in the deep south ft. demon lady,"let me say first that this is my first post here. i've been working at a place with a gemstone and a day of the week in the name for around 10 months or so, and in that time, i've learned to deeply hate the south. here are a few of my favorite stories.

old people: old people are the worst. i feel like i work in a retirement home. they don't tip, they complain about where i seat them. (i'm a host.) and they also complain when i ask them to not touch me. (southern culture, ladies and gentlemen. the older generation loves to be grabby.) not to mention, the men are extremely creepy, asking me to go home with them. have another regular who would hit and make sexual propositions a server who is only 20. luckily, she knocked him down a peg. 

(dude had the gall to wave 30 dollars he tipped to one of our older waitresses in her face, saying this is what she missed out on. i wanted to smack him. he learned pretty quickly that i wasn't someone to talk too, as i don't take kindly to misogynistic and patronizing ""compliments."")

kids: kids in my resturaunt are fucking awful. kids in general are awful at resturaunts, but these one in specific are the worst. most of the time parents let a phone entertain the kids, and they throw shit everywhere, shred the crayons, and make disgusting messes that i alone have to clean up.

now, on to some more house oriented stuff. being corporate, we have to bend over backwards to accomodate people. since our staff can't be fucking trash. (another southern woe, no one here has any work ethic at all.) this isn't always a problem. however, there are times when it makes me furious. 

enter demon lady and pervert son. demon lady is about 4'10"", with a crop of mousy grey hair that looks like it hasn't seen a brush in a decade. son is obviously slow, and loves to stare at the waitresses breasts as he talks. for some, this isn't an issue, but it is for me. i don't like it, it creeps me out, and as such i didn't really like helping this table. the son asks me about something on the menu. our menu is gigantic and it changes every fucking month or so it seems, so i don't memorize every item. he asks about something that isn't wildly popular, and i tell him i don't really know and that their server could do better. he begins to patronize me, telling me it must be so hard to learn such a big menu. i grunt and walk away. mother makes a comment as i leave that the ""item was on there last time she came."" bitch, you fuckers constantly ask if we have biscuits when we haven't had biscuits for three years!

later, they apparently had a bad time. demon lady gets right in my face, like five inches form my face and asks when the general manager will be in next. i reply i don't know, and to protect his privacy, i don't want to ask. she screams ""you don't know shit do you?"" and storms out. the rest i hear from the cook. one of our cooks was running out to give money to his roommate, and says ""excuse me."" to demon lady and her son as they were in the foyer. she calls back later, saying that the cook pushed her son to the ground maliciously and laughed. cameras proved otherwise. apparently when the cook told them to have a great day, she screamed at him ""you can fuck off.""

our gm scolded me for not accommodating her and that he now had tons of paper work to do. i was speechless. they gave this horrible woman who screams at staff a free meal, and her son who attempted to grope our more busty server. this is probably the worst thing i remember. as i tend to be rather blunt when dealing with customers, i get a lot of nasty stares and people do complain about me, but i do my job well and i'm very kind when people ask me things. just don't be creepy or treat my servers like trash and you'll get great treatment.

i have more stories, but this is getting long, so i'll post them later. (also, to those that live in the south: the area i live is a hotbed for tourism. a lot of the people i see are snowbirds, tourists, or retirees. this mixing pot creates a disgusting slew of behavior.)",Azurehue22,tfys
634,"just some crystal on the floor, nbd","this was a few years ago, i worked at a family friendly chain in a nice area. it was early evening, so a bunch of servers were on but no one was particularly busy so there was about 5 of us waiting at the service well chatting/waiting for drinks.

some angry guy came us to saying he just found a “fucking bag of crystal” over by one of the tables in the bar and held it out. it was definitely meth. and like, a lot of meth. i have no idea how much in terms of grams or ounces but it was like one of those bags buttons come in (not a tiny drug baggie) completely filled to the top with crystal meth.

i started to grab it, planning to go to a manager but i panicked. what if the manager saw me clutching a big bag of meth before i could explain ??? or a customer saw???  (i’m paranoid idk) 

the one guy server that was there grabbed the bag, put it in the trash and immediately took the trash out.

found out later that night when we told the manager what happened that we were supposed to turn it in and file a police report, but the meth was gone, no one had to do paperwork, and we didn’t notice anyone coming back to look for it. tbh the guy who turned it in had tweaker vibes himself but maybe he was just angry there was meth in on the floor of our restaurant...

638,i don't get paid to beg.,"just happened but last night, we had a dinner where the organizer pre-bought 5 bottles of wine for each table. after this if they want anymore, they will have to buy their own. well table 7 didn't like this and called for the manager. i'm not a manager but i'm experienced enough to deal with most complaints or crap. the conversation went something like this:  
me: ""hello sir, i'm mrmusclepants one of the supervisors here today. i understand you've got an issue.  
guest 1: ""yes, we'd like more wine.""  
me: ""i'm sorry sir, each table has an allocation of half a bottle per person (normal) and you've just up what you're entitled to.""  
g1: ""well that won't do. you've brought us all the way out here \[i hadn't\] and won't give us more wine. i could have just stayed at home. why can't i have another bottle?""  
me: ""i'm happy to bring you more wine sir but you will have to pay for it.""  
g1: ""i'm not going to pay for it.""  
\[there now follows a pause where we just stare into each other's eyes waiting for someone to break.\]  
me: ""then i can't help you sir."" \[and i walk off.\]  


then 10 minutes later on the same table.  
guest 2: ""excuse me dear, we appear to have run out of wine but other tables have plenty left. would you be so kind to ask them to share it with us?""  


now at work i get paid to do a lot of things. bend over backwards for vips, run around like a maniac, take grief from upset guests and once, dress in costume and stand there looking pretty. but i don't get paid to beg, certainly not if you're going to try and twist the reason why i should beg to be our fault.

639,please don’t grab me,"so i’ve been working in this lovely restaurant for about 10 months now. the way it works is you order up front at the cash registers, they give you your drinks, you find a table, a server comes and serves you. right? okay.

some background about me: i’m small. the -you can barely see me over the computer monitor register- kind of small. i’ve always had a quiet voice and terrible anxiety. throughout my time here i have definitely learned to burst out of that shell and now stand tall (figuratively of course) and proud at work. but seeing as this was my second week of working and my first week being off training, i was still a little freaked out and shy to the customers. 

one day i come in for my morning shift and my general manager lets me know that we have a limited supply of to-go cup lids and that we are not allowed to give to-go cups to anyone who doesn’t have a to-go order, and if any customer argues, just tell them it’s managers orders. simple, right? wrong. 

i clock in and get to work. i’ve taken a few orders so far when a tall man and his wife walk in. now, this man looked scary. your standard beefy older man who had this deadly stare that could melt your soul. i hadn’t even served him yet and i was already intimidated. it comes time for him to order and i ask the couple 
“is this for here or to-go?” 
and they reply that they’re eating here. yay. that means i get to serve him. 
when he orders his drink, he asks for a to-go cup. i let him know that, per manager’s orders, i can’t give him a to-go cup seeing as our supply for lids was down. 
he grumbled but didn’t say anything else about it. after they paid, i went to get their drinks. 

now, my register was right next to the machine. all i had to do was reach down for the cups, and take one step over and fill them up. 

upon seeing me grab the normal cups, the man once again asks for a to-go cup. and i once again tell him that i can’t give him one. i then begin to shovel ice into the cup. 

before i can do anything else, 
he reaches over the counter and grabs my arm that’s holding the cup. 
i completely froze. he then pulls my arm away from the machine and stares me in the eyes and asks me 

“i’ll be taking it to-go later on after i finish my meal, right? so that means that i need. a. to-go. cup” and just smiles at me. (he still hasn’t let go of my arm and is still leaning over the counter, so he’s basically in my face) 

i just say in a shaky voice “yes sir.” and promptly grab a to-go cup and pour the ice into it and get his drink and his wife’s, who’s just standing there looking at this whole thing without thinking twice to stop him. 

after they left the counter, i told my coworker that i needed her to take that table and i’d take another one of hers. and then i told my manager what happened and had to sit in the back office eating crackers and drinking water while trying not to have a full blown panic attack from the incident. 

is that it? no. 

later on, i’ve calmed down and i’m out on the floor serving another couple their food. as i walk away and head towards another one of my tables to see if they needed anything, a hand reaches out and grabs my arm. 

it’s the same guy. 

i freeze in my place and turn to look at him and ask if he needs something. he then says the following: 

“i’m sorry for my behavior earlier. i shouldn’t have grabbed your arm for that long.” 

he grabbed my arm to get my attention and held onto it tightly just to tell me that he was sorry for grabbing my arm.

needless to say, i had that panic attack. ",crisisinahallway,tfys
640,"""you were very nice, thank you! but your manager is a sack of shit""","my last table of the night. 4 top. just got cut ten minutes afterwards. it's been a cocktail long shift, a good 10 hours straight at that point. still not feeling very well from the food posioning i had yesterday. just wanted to go home and rest. 

this table was the last i ever wanted to have to deal with. they were younger, probably late teens since they didn't order alcohol and awkwardly laughed at every stupid shit. like me asking how things are going, no one says anything, and me not in the mood i just think ""ok"" and walk away and they'd laugh. also the type where they'd ask for a sauce, then i ask if anyone else needs some, no response, walk all the fucking way across and back the restaurant then one goes, oh actually i need ranch! etc. 

anyways. the main guy ordered a large 16"" specialty vegan pizza, and everything else for the table, apps etc. half way through their pizza, main guy waves me down and says, ""actually they (the other 3) don't like the pizza because of the vegan chz, i like it, but is it okay if we replace it with something else?""

i look at their plates. our large pies are 8 slices so half of that is obviously 4 and there's 4 of them. each plate had nothing but barely any crust lefy. now i'm annoyed. they don't like it because of the vegan cheese but they ate it still? like i understand a bite or two, if you don't like it, say it right away. cuz people use this tactic to fill their stomachs with free shit. 

so i know what they're trying to pull here. so i tell my manager the story. he asks how much they ate, half, no if they want a different pizza they're still gonna pay for the one they have. 

so i tell them, ""unfortunately we still need to charge for the initial pizza, but i can gladly bring you a box, since you're the only one who said liked the pizza and can take it home with you for leftovers! still want the 2nd pizza?"" i'm saying this to the main guy. ""yeah that's fine.""

welp they all ended eating the entire first pizza as i brought them the 2nd one they wanted which is our most expensive one, not vegan. one eats half ofa slice, main guys ask for a box, and the bill. 

with their many apps, sodas and both charged pizzas, tab was $70. 

on top of the slip, ""you were very nice, thank you! but your manager is a sack of shit.""

so anyway, one night i was working my section on the rooftop and this elderly couple had just been seated. the man gave me a really pained expression and tried to half croak, half gasp a question about the menu to me, which took me two more goes (and a lot of pointing and gesturing) to understand. i looked to the wife for  help but she was hand signing everything to her husband so i realised i wasn't getting much help there.

now it turns out not only were both of them practically mute (the bloke having had a large portion of his vocal cords removed a few weeks earlier), but to compound that, both of them could barely hear either :(. i ended up leaving one of my notepads with a pen at their table and if an issue arose with their order, i'd write down the situation and questions before going to the table. we ended up having a pretty good conversation across the night all through passing notes to each other :). they were easily one of the sweetest pair of customers i've ever had, even wrote a note to my boss praising my service which was just incredible.

but by far the loveliest part of the whole interaction was when i said goodbye at the end of their dinner; the husband stood up, shook my hand, took a deep breath and with obvious pain on his face, croaked the word ""thankyou"", and my heart just about melted.

646,"yes, bottled water costs extra.","the number of times i have had to explain this to tables amazes me.  part of our steps of service is offering tap or bottled water.  90% of the time people take tap.  most of the time when people order bottled, they are aware that it isn't free.  if it was free why wouldn't everyone just order bottled water?  two separate tables today said they would like bottled.  the first table i was about to pour it for them when one of them asked if it costs extra.  i told them yes, and they immediately wanted to switch to tap.  not a big deal since i hadn't poured it.  the other table had two bottles of water and when they got the bill, they were upset because they didn't know that it wasn't free.  i just feel like it's common knowledge, but maybe i just know this because i work in restaurants?  does anyone else come across this issue?  it honestly blows my mind.",Dyliful,tfys
647,too disgusting for words,"so, back at it again with my job. i was planning to make a post about my awful coworkers, but after yesterday i just had to make a post about this. 

small recap for those that haven't seen my previous post, i work in a small family-owned turkish restaurant/take-out/delivery in a small town, as one of the only 2 waitresses. 

except for serving tables and finishing my orders, my job also involves a good bit of cleaning (luckily no dishes or i would've quit ages ago, people are pigs). yesterday (tuesday) i was restocking the saucebottles for restaurant guests, and as i opened one, i noticed the entire bottle was filled with mold. the tip, the cap, the inside, the whole lot was green. i showed it to my boss (because i always notify them first about these things so they can't blame me later on) and he said ""just wash the old sauce out with water and it should be fine"". a bottle. filled. with mold. and i should *just wash it with water*. am i glad i don't eat that sauce ever, but i geniunely retch thinking of customers who do.

in my 5 months of working here though, this isn't the first moldy experience i had that was completely disregarded. let me just start by saying, i wasn't aware i had something to clean other than tables and saucebottles until 2 months in. aka i had worked 2 months and not done any of the required cleaning on the nights i worked alone (which was every night i worked) because they forgot to tell me. 

now this was my second time working on a thursday, about 3 months in. thursday is the small freezer at the pizza station. for those unfamiliar, most turks here also serve italian dishes, including pizza, for reasons i'll never understand and never care enough to ask. 

so i prepare to wash the freezer, which takes a while since it has to be at a time no pizzas are getting ordered. when i open the door the first thing that just perplexes me is the stench. this freezer holds all of the non-standard toppings, aka everything you wouldn't find on a standard ham/salami pizza. so there's different kinds of cheese in there, different greens, fish-items. so the stench isn't unusual, but i didn't expect it to be that bad. as i remove the food items to clean the freezer, the stench just gets worse though. after removing the drawers of the freezer, leaving it completely empty, i finally understand why. the freezer is covered. fully, covered. in mold. a white and green blanket over the entire thing. and most of the topping containers are fully uncovered, so the mold could literally be in any of them! i tried cleaning the whole thing thoroughly, but it was pretty clear some of the mold had been there for so long, it wouldn't come off with a simple clean. 

in the mean time there was already a pizza order again, so i quickly put everything back and stepped away, promising myself never to order another pizza here and to not look into that ever. could i have done a more thorough job at cleaning that disgusting mess? definitely. should i have reported it? probably. but i really don't get paid enough to care. all i know now is that i warn literally everyone i know to not order a pizza with any toppings other than ham, cheese, salami, onion or paprika. 

later on today, or tomorrow i'll elaborate more on the ""pay"" part, because it's a hell to work there, and to have to co-operate with just blatantly robbing people of their money

edit: something i forgot to add, their personal hygene. it's.... awful. there's no handsoap except in the customer's toilet. they work with near raw meat and fresh greens, and there's no soap. there's a lack of any proper cleaning material.

something that nearly had me throw up in my first week there was the fact that they left their beards uncovered. i found small black hairs in my food in my first week. i'm always alert for it now, but it's repulsive. there's no protective measure for hair other than ""females have to tie their hair""",Catorsomethingiguess,tfys
648,just in time!,"when you close in 5 minutes and a customer rushes in asking if you’re closed so you tell them you close in 5 minutes and they exclaim “oh, just in time!” and proceed to make themselves comfortable. my favorite kind of customer. ",moodle_noodle,tfys
649,managers managers managers. why is it always the managers?,"i love where i work. it's a locally owned restuarant where you see the owner frequently and everyone is like family, even the wanting the throttle them sometimes part of the family. 



i'm an expo/foh, and i absolutely love it, except for the problems of a manager that have been developing. 



let's call this manager n. when n joined our team she was actually transferred from our sister company. she was optimistic, hands on, and extremely helpful. everyone brightened up when she would walk in the doors because we knew the shift was about to run smoothly. n made sure food was run, she'd help knock down the line at the registers, and she'd buss tables like no one else. i made sure to talk well about her directly to the owner whenever possible because she wants to be promoted to gm at a new second location opening up this year! 



she does barely anything now. she no longer runs food. she will stare right at the plates falling out of the window and walk right past, while blatantly ignoring me begging for help. she will also refuse to run it and push the food into literally anyone else's hands. she has yelled at me alone three times for small things. 



for example, a guest sent back a cheese dip asking for more. the customer ordered the largest size so i was confused by what she meant by more. n steps in with the food runner and i to tell me just to remake it. my gm would have my butt if i threw away so much cheese dip without good reason, so when i told n i wanted to know exactly what the guest meant first, she started yelling at me. i asked why on earth she was yelling and she claimed she wasnt. my gm (who was standing directly behind her) told n she was, and then n threw down what she was holding, yelled ""whatever"" and walked away. when my gm spoke to the guest, the guest wanted the cheese dip to be hotter. we just heated it up.  when she later talked to me she apologized for ""seeming to be yelling"" and told me that i should just do what she says without argument in the future. i didnt argue with her and accepted her ""apology"". this is not the first ""apology"" i've gotten from her but they're all the same. 



n also yells at other staff. when i took a few days vacation, she took over the expo. she yells at the line cooks, yells at the food runners, and cant figure out how to organize the tickets. she gets incredibly stressed quickly over small problems, and she does not watch the times causing ticket times to go up to 20 minutes or more (all tickets should take 10 max). one of my other managers had a leg injury recently and asked if n would mind if she could expo so she wouldn't have to walk much on her injured leg. n refused and told her to run food anyways. n also pushed people off the expo when i'm not there. she also pushes cashiers off the registers during rushes to get tips (she is not salaried so she can keep them). when i came back all the staff was relieved she was off the expo. one of the line cooks told me i wasnt allowed to take another weekday off again (only half joking) because of how awful n had been.



also due to the fact n wants to be a gm at the new location she constantly uptalks herself to the owner. any time she speaks to him and if there is any success in the restaurant, n tries to somehow interject herself into it somehow to seem like she was part of it, even if she's not. our other managers will uptalk all the employees, usually only crediting themselves if relevant. n only focuses on herself. it's almost sickening to hear. 



she also freaks often on an autistic guy we have hired. now, d is annoying as all hell and he has said some mean things, he is horribly annoying, and he can throw some tantrums, but the way n treats him makes me sad. she constantly tells him to shut up, that she ""doesnt want to deal with his crap"" (real quote from yesterday) and she told me outright that she was disgusted and repulsed by him. 



not to say she doesn't do some good work. she does still buss tables, talk to customers, help on the line, and take care of to-go orders, but she gets so stressed out now, yells at people often, and is always so unhappy. a lot of my co-workers are disappointed and unhappy with her. several people have said she is too comfortable now. it stresses me out and i get agitated around her because n is always agitated. 




there are a lot more examples to give. i've been trying my absolute best to deal with it, ignore it, and let it roll off my back, but it is getting extremely hard to work with her due to her negativity and the yelling. i try to hard to stay upbeat but this is killing me. i dont want to complain to my gm, even in a nice way because i've had to complain before and i've only just come back to the company a month ago. 



how to i deal with this? should i talk to n about it? should i talk to my gm and try and get him to help? am i overreacting and i just need to suck it up? i'm not looking to get her fired or in trouble, i just want her to be what she was when she first joined.",balimango7722,tfys
650,question: why do people hate the hostess?,"i just got back into working hostessing at this fancy italian restaurant (my husband is also a server there but gets no special treatment). i am new, this place is all paper and pencil, and has a bunch of stuff, but it pays fantastic and i’m getting better every day. anyway, i have a set of rules to follow, and i listen to the managers (duh), and the servers berate me for “f-ing up all the time” and being awful at my job. i literally was told that nobody likes me (to the point of tears.) luckily, one of the good servers noticed me trying my best not to cry and told the owners who are dealing with it and let me leave. is this normal? if you have a problem i will do my best to fix it, but she overlooked everything i did, when i have a question i asked the manager etc. she said i did nothing wrong. i haven’t ever worked as a single hostess before and i didn’t know some servers just hate us so much. i try my best and i don’t understand. it was embarrassing and hard tonight and just, i know it’s easier than serving, but keep in mind being the host is hard too. *cheers to being home* ",LizzieCLems,tfys

652,no i won’t go home with you..,"today i worked the morning/lunch shift which usually isn’t very busy on tuesdays.. but today it was. it wasn’t hectic or anything and most of my tables were amazing and clean... 
then one table walked in and they gave me a weird vibe. one of them wouldn’t stop staring at me with a creepy smile on his face.. and at first i was like, maybe he’s just trying to be friendly and that’s just how he looks, ya know? 
but then when i go over and ask if they need anything, he starts doing everything possible to get me to stay and talk to them, like asking things that have nothing to do with the restaurant and trying to make jokes, usually it’s fine and i can laugh along but i swear i still just had a weird vibe.. so i decide that i was just going to check on them less often, keep my eyes on them from afar because i didn’t want to interact with this guy anymore..
eventually they get their check and pay and then they sit there for awhile so i asked one last time if they need anything ( like i always do) and the guy looks at me in the eyes and says, “yeah, you. i’d love to take you home.” um excuse me, what? “i do have a wife at home but i’m sure she’d love to share, let me take you home.” 
at this point i’m visually uncomfortable and i kinda panic since i’m not sure what to say and i stumbled over my words and thank goodness the two other guys at the table are also visibly uncomfortable and they were like oh my god ignore him.. 

idk, it just bothered me. it was one of those times where i thought, do all servers need to wear a sign that reads “i give you attention and am nice to you because it is my job”?",Bubba_lynn,tfys
653,racist assholes are never happy,"so i'm not actually a server, but a host. but either way, last night we had a couple come in who i think are worthy of having their story shared.

yesterday was monday, so when i came in to work i thought it would be slow like normal, but it was actually surprisingly busy, and we were down a couple servers because they'd called off. we ended up on a half hour wait for a while and somewhere in the middle of that this couple comes in and when they're put on the wait they request one of our large 6 person booths which annoys me because we had parties of 6 and 7 that we could put there but no, these two people need that booth.

one of my coworkers tells me that she's seen them before and actually got into an argument with them because she hadn't wanted to waste such a large table on two people so now she was just going to put them there. whatever. so the time comes to seat them and we get them into the booth they want (i think they actually specifically requested this table, we have 3 large booths all right next to each other but i think they requested the one in the middle, which they got).

so we put them at the table, they sit down, and as soon as the server comes to the table they want to move. (what??) they say the table wiggles and they don't like it. the manager comes over and moves them to a regular sized booth somewhere else, but they don't like that because it's in a corner. so he moves them into a different room to yet another booth which they finally agree to sit in. the best part? it's still in a corner!

anyway they're finally sitting and the new server comes over to greet them. (this girl is asian, it's important, i promise). i was telling her how picky these people have been so far and when she saw them she tells me that she's served them before and it was horrible. complaining about everything just to get a free meal, etc. another server tells us that he's also served them before but had no problems and they even tipped him well. it was a little strange but whatever.

a few minutes go by and these people don't seem to be happy. their server takes their order. or rather, tries to take their order. the woman wants salmon or something but we have two kinds and she doesn't seem to want to tell the server which one she wants. she also won't tell her what kind of soup she wants. when the server tries to get her to say which salmon she wants the woman actually starts yelling at her saying ""i pointed to it, you're not even trying to get this right you're a terrible server"" and other things like that. the server apologizes and then walks away. i had been near the area when this happened so i followed her up to the front to ask what happened.

the manager also comes up and she explains what happened to him and he heads over to the table to try to smooth things out, and the woman actually yells at the manager too! the sever said she no longer wanted to serve them if they're going to yell at her (obviously she only told the manager, not that table) so the manager finds another server to take it, and it's actually the guy from earlier who said he had fine experiences with them.

after he becomes their new server, everything changed. i saw him walking away from their table multiple times smiling and laughing with them. after i saw this i realized that these people are fucking racist in the worst way i've actually seen in my life (i'm white so i mean i don't really experience it much so maybe other people have experienced something worse).

but these people were willing to yell at a young woman and the manager of the restaurant until they got a white server. it was very uncomfortable and nearly ruined the girl's night, and i have never hated a stranger more.",QueenMolly5,tfys
654,well she didn't say i couldn't..,"okay so, last night i was coming to the end of a very slow and boring double. i serve alone all day on mondays, and it's off season here so this is the usual for right now. well, i finally got a pop of about 4 tables. not much, but i'll take it. get all the people sat, and gave them their drinks. the first table that had came in asked for a liquor menu. i informed him that our menu is a tad out dated and i could list the beers and wine for him and if hed like to he could walk to the guest side of the bar and look at the liquor. he seemed happy enough. i told him i'd return to get there bar order momentarily. i had to go get orders from my other 3 tables. all the sudden my sushi chef is behind my bar asking that man if he could help him. this man walked behind my bar and was grabbing my liqour and wine bottles to see what we had. i told the guest i was with to excuse me and i'd return in a second. the man told my sushi chef i told him he could go back there. i responded with no sir, i told you that you could look from the other side. his exact response was "" well she didnt say i couldnt come back here, so i dont understand the problem."" i didnt say he couldnt go back there, hes correct. but i also did not say he could. and that shit should go without being said in the first place. it's fucking implied, dude!

655,the worst sunday (aka getting screwed by tip pool and tip out).,"i had my ass kicked this past sunday, and am still salty about it. it's a smaller place that doesn't do brunch (we don't have any hot beverages or a brunch/lunch menu) so sundays are typically quiet. 

i worked 12 hours, ended up earning $500 in tips. but due to our high tip out and it being tip pool, i am only getting $250 of that. 

there were only three staff in the entire restaurant for the day: me for foh, one kitchen guy, and one dish guy. i did 57 covers alone from 1230 to 345pm. evening staff didn't come in until 430/530. 

we were then short staffed for the evening so i stayed and helped the two evening staff. ended up taking the second floor on my own. the restaurant filled up for a few hours again. 

according to my fit bit i did 22,000 steps and 53 flights of stairs. fml. 

$250 is good, i'm not complaining about that. but after busting my ass for 12 hours non-stop, no support staff, and walking out with half of what i earned is a slap to the face.

656,someone almost choked to death on their birthday,"i work at a chain steakhouse and people love coming out to eat a nice steak for their birthday. we are right next to an outlets right off of i-95 and next to an airport... we stay pretty busy. so last friday night its 6:30 and we have been slammed since 4. we are an an hour+ wait. still things are going pretty smoothly and everyone is having a good time. then i hear one of our female servers who is normally very calm and collected just losing her shit on the other side of the restaurant asking for help, she can't breath! 

the tables and booths in that area are all just frozen in fear watching this poor lady choke to death. our bartender practically leaps over the bar and pushes people out of the way to go try and heimlich the choking patron. bartender is giving it everything shes got but its just not working and now the whole restaurant has come to a complete stop watching this. of course people have their phones out recording this too... like wtf.

so bartender is not having any success and this poor lady's family is just watching in agony and then the choking lady just goes 100% limp, dead weight in bartenders arms. i've never actually seen someone lose consciousness like that before that's when shit got real. bartender lowers her to the ground and starts screaming for someone to dial 911 and yelling out for any doctors. 

a male who i later leaned was a marine and a female nurse rush over and check for breathing and a pulse and immediately start to administer cpr. this is also the first time i have ever seen anyone do cpr in real life. the nurse is working on her like crazy yelling at the patron to stay with her, all while violently pressing on and off of her chest while now dinner service has just completely stopped. the choking patrons server is crying, random strangers are crying, parents are trying to get their young children to look away and keep the distracted, and its fucking *silent* all you can hear is the sound of cpr being performed, and the song ""die a happy man"" by thomas rhett playing over the sound system.

one of our managers had tried to get runners to deliver food, but who the fuck wants to eat while there is someone dying 10 feet away from them? watching one try to drop off dinner plates to a family that is watching in dismay was so cringey. 

so now the fire truck pulls in and these guys come running in and immediately tack over cpr from the nurse and marine. they are informed that there was something lodged in her throat and start speaking jargon on the radio. i would say the time elapsed from her starting to choke has now been 5-6 minutes and shes been having cpr done on her for 2-3. the ambulance shows up, they get her on a back board and then on a gurney and rush her out of there all while still performing chest compressions and her two crying family members rushing behind them. its been at least another whole minute. 

now nobody knows what to do... everyone is sure we just witnessed someone die... the restaurant is in dissaray from all the tables that had been moved to allow access for the emt's, and there's now a whole cycles worth of tickets that are ready to be ran to people that don't want to eat anymore. 

so of course i didn't see anything that happened after they wheeled her out on the stretcher but this is just what i heard. once they got her into the ambulance, they stayed right there in the parking lot and tried to use suction to remove the lodged piece of food. that did not work, and they say that if you can't get it with the suction that heimlich wouldn't have worked anyways. so they used a ridiculously long pair of forceps to reach down her throat and grab it and got it out of her. they continued cpr and got her to breath again but she had very weak vitals so they rushed her to the closes hospital. the family called around 9 pm and said that she was still recovering and wasn't out of the woods yet but all the signs were positive. i also didn't know until their server told me later that it was her freaking birthday! the two guests she was with had already asked for the birthday sundae and song at the end of the meal for her. 

when my gm went out to the ambulance to get a status update and found out they got her breathing again she came running back in and just screamed shes alive! the whole place erupted with cheering and clapping, complete 180 in emotions from a second ago. the dinner service for the rest of the night was terrible, everyone was off there game and the kitchen crashed hard and never recovered we had 40 minute ticket times and all running side work was neglected. obviously the guests who had been in the restaurant during what had happened were understanding but once they all cycled out and the new guests who were not present started their meals it was rough. and i just wanted to scream at them that their fucking ranch cup doesn't matter and one day were all going to die and none of this is important but instead had to put on my best server face and apologize for the plate not coming out with ranch. i have never seen my gm comp so much food before. literally every single complaint at the end of the night instead of trying to fix it was just an automatic comp, like she didn't even feel like bothering with it.

some takeaways: 1. i need to learn the heimlich and how to give cpr. i'm going to be dad soon so i want to learn infant cpr as well. 2. chew your food. 3. perspective... all of my problems seemed really small after witnessing that, right now i am just glad to be alive and have someone that loves me. 

tldr: women chokes on her birthday dinner and goes completely under. cpr is performed untill emt's show up and save her life in the ambulance in the parking lot. dinner service is ruined but who the fuck cares, i'm just happy to be alive",north_by_southeast,tfys

659,why is this a common theme with me,"do any of you remember that story i put up about having a little boy grab my chest? yeah, this stuff keeps happening to me apparently.

if you haven't read that story, here's a little background: i'm short with a big chest. it stinks, but it's what i got. our tables in my resteraunt are a little lower, especially the booths, so everyone's eye level is right where the goods are. it can make for some good tips with tables full of men, but is generally not my favorite thing.

so, it's the end of the night and i'm on my last table. they haven't paid, and have been just sitting for over 30 minutes, food all boxed up. slowly, the two gentlemen are sipping on their second bottle of wine, their girlfriends having a separate conversation.

i go over, having finished all my silverware and sidework, with some refill pitchers, hoping to give them some hints.

one guy, who definitely had more of the wine than the other gives me a slightly creepy look. he'll be known as ""dg,"" his girlfriend ""dgl"" and the other man and woman as ""og"" and ""ogl"" respectively.

dg: ""hey... i've got a question for you..."" his girl, at this point, is obviously pinching his arm very hard.

me: ""sure, what can i do for you?""

dg: ""do you know what motorboating is?"" 

i've never expected to hear the word ""motorboating"" from a guest at a more upscale italian resteraunt, so i'm pretty sure i had a brain seizure.

me: "".... uhm, yes?"" 

dgl has her head down on the table at this point, with og kicking his friend and ogl having her hands over her mouth. 

dg: ""have you ever been motorboated before?""

i'm ashamed to admit it, but i didn't have a good comeback. i was in enough shock to warrant sending me to a hospital, most likely. 

me: ""as a grown adult, uh, yeh? i guess?"" 

he looks satisfied, the women both want to crawl under the table and die, and his friend is horrified. i want to pass out from my response alone, honestly.

i leave, tell the manager so he knows i'm not going back there, and they stay for a whole nother hour, trapping me there as well since they haven't even paid. 

who has the guts to say that to their server (and i can pass for a 16 year old!!) and then stay at the resteraunt for an hour??

661,puked on the table and left in secret,"i have many tales to tell from working at restaurants since the age of 15, but this one is by far the most memorable. i worked night-shifts (6 pm to midnight) twice a week at a traditionally austrian restaurant. we'd often have business men from a big international company nearby come for business dinners, and sometimes they brought chinese people with them because the company had a branch there as well. 

it's about half an hour before we close, and it's only me, my co-worker, and approximately fifteen businessmen left, two of them austrian and the rest chinese. the austrians had been very keen on getting the chinese guys drunk, ordering an insane amount of beer and schnaps, but they were all fun and not a hard group to deal with, and since they were in a secluded area we didn't have to check up on them often. 

anyway, they ordered one last round of beer and paid immediately after when one of the chinese guys already fell asleep at the table, the other's being completely drunk as well. we brought them their beer, let one of the austrian guys (remarkably sober at that point) pay the bill and then left them to their own devices. approx 5 minutes later they suddenly all got up and left in quite a hurry, no one really looking at us as they left. we found that behaviour odd because they were so nice throughout the night, but whatever.

my colleague says she'll go clean their table and enters the next room, and next thing i know i just hear her screaming in disgust. turns out one of the chinese guys threw up all over the table. it was quite... catastrophic. and none of them had the decency to tell us about it. i'd understand if you'd come to me, say sorry this happened, and that's it. but they thought they could just sneak out without a word.

bad luck for them, they had made a reservation so we had their phone number and my boss knew one of the austrian business man's bosses and told him what happened, so he got a scolding and wasn't welcome to the restaurant anymore. 

out of every damn thing i've witnessed in my waitress career, this still leaves me completely baffled. ",alonelymushroom,tfys
662,“a restaurant that cares”,"     i’ve been considering something that happened recently and wanted your guys’ opinion. just to preface, i work in a newer restaurant/bar that was born from an old house. this with the buzz of a new place and good food makes us pretty hectic some nights.  unfortunately, this also means minimal space and craziness. 


    i walked in on friday night for my shift to 20 and 15-top (we have party rooms for groups 8 and above) , numerous 4,5-tops, and the expected walk-ins for a weekend shift. in the middle of prepping for this shitstorm we had someone call around 4:15. i’ll transcribe that conversation. 

phone: we’re calling to make a reservation for 12 people in twenty minutes. 

me: unfortunately, we have two large parties at this time and are booked up. you’re welcome to come in at a later time and try for a table, but we can’t make any guarantees. 

phone: well we called ahead of time so we’re going to come in. we’ll be there in twenty

me: sir, i wish i could seat you now but we just can’t. i’ll call you back directly in around two hours to let you know if we have a spot. 

phone: whatever (hangs up)

  despite the abrupt phone call we called them back after all the servers busting our asses to buss and reset the party room. i called back and they picked up 

me: hello! this is _____. we’re calling to let you know we had an opening and can guarantee you a table for your whole party. when can you make it in? 

phone: actually we made plans at a different restaurant. 

me: okay!  have a good night and tha-

phone: yes, they seem to actually care about their customers and make reservations to those who are willing to spend their money. we don’t plan on coming in anytime soon.

663,lady demanded to make a reservation when she didn’t even know when she wanted to make it,"this was an actual phone call i had today:

bitch: “hi i was just wondering, if i came in during lunch time, can i order off of the dinner menu?”

me: “unfortunately ma’am, we only serve dinner after 4.”

b: “are you sure?”

me: “yes.”

b: “yeah, i don’t think so. check with ur manager.”

me: *checks with manager even though i know the answer because i’ve been working here since day one*

me: “yes ma’am i can confirm we do not serve dinner during lunchtime.” 

bitch: “ugh whatever: can i make a reservation for dinner then?”

me: “sure. for how many guests?”

b: “12”

me: “what day?”

b: “uhhhh idk.”

*silence*

me: “sometime this week?”

b: “uhhh idk it’s up in the air rn.”

*more silence*

me: “unfortunately ma’am i can’t make a reservation unless i know when you want it”

b: “ok i understand but make one anyways”

me:...

me: “i’m unable to do that”

b: “ok umm...do you have happy hour on your patio?”

me: “unfortunately no. only at the bar and high tops.”

b: “but we want happy hour outside.”

me: “we don’t do that unfortunately”

b: “lemme speak to the manager.”

*manager comes and tells her the same exact thing i did*

b: “uhh ok. we’ll eat inside then. can you go ahead and make the reservation?”

me: “sure. what day?”

664,my wife’s tip,"my wife and i work at a small family owned casual restaurant that is very popular locally. sundays we do an insane amount of business. 

last night an older woman came in alone and seemed like something was bothering her. it was close to the end of the night and business had slacked off so my wife decided this would be the last table she picked up. she sat down with the woman and asked if everything was okay. 

the woman broke down in tears telling her that her husband had been beating her for 40 years. said she had tried to leave him many times but never could get away. said that she finally managed to save enough for a cheap used car and he took it and totaled it almost immediately.  all kinds of horrible abuse and very personal stuff. 

my wife did the best she could with encouraging words and they hugged and cried. she gave her cheesecake on the house.   (we are famous for the owners homemade cheesecake. people come from all over just for it.) 
not a lot but she did what she could. 

my wife signs the bill “hope” (they have to sign the bottom of the ticket to ensure credit card tips go to the right person) and the woman says that it must be a sign from god to not give up hope. they hug again and she leaves. 

there was a napkin with the tip and [this](https://i.imgur.com/gwshlw5.jpg) is the note she left on it. my wife came into the kitchen line to show me.

665,getting a tip from a cougar,"so when i was 20 i started working at a chain steakhouse. in my last week of training i wasn’t taking tables, but i was helping with expo and helping servers who are in the weeds. so this one day one of the servers is deep in the weeds and two women in their mid to late 50’s sit down at one of her tables. so i go out and bring them bread and take their drink order. nothing fancy, just doing the regular niceties.

later i’m at expo and end up delivering food to the same table. i give them the “can i get you anything else? enjoy your food.” so i go to boh and a few minutes later the server comes and asks what i said to them because they told her i was cute and wanted to know if i was straight and single. thought it was funny so i go to bring them some a1 sauce and say to them “hello ladies, unfortunately i do not date customers but if you come back ask for silverhammer96 and i’d be happy to show you a good time here.”

didn’t think too much of it, went back to work. after they left turns out they tipped the server really well and specifically left $15 for me.",silverhammer96,tfys

667,that's not how any of this works,"more of a general rant than a specific story. 

at least once a week i will have someone order two things at once when i'm taking entree orders, and the conversation usually goes like this. 

customer: i'll have the guacamole and the crab cakes. 

me: sure! would you like the guac first or both together as your meal? 

c: oh, whichever

m: well... i can do whatever you want

c: it doesn't matter

m: it's really just up to you... 

c: you can put it all in together and just bring the guac out when it's ready 

m: it would all come out at once then

c: (annoyed) okay then you can bring it first

m: okay

i literally can't just go grab whatever i want from the kitchen. that's not how expo works. just tell me what you want.

668,people will complain about anything,"so i got called into the office for a “talk” with one of my managers tonight.  apparently last night a woman was so displeased with my lack of personality that she felt compelled to email my restaurant directly to complain about me. i got to read a copy of this lovely email. this woman said i was “really insincere” and had the personality of a “wet blanket” and said i seemed better suited for a diner than a hip restaurant.  she also didn’t forget to mention that she too is a server.  bitch, please. i don’t believe that for a second. no server is going to take extra time out of their day to throw another server under the bus just because they were too boring.  i’m pretty sure we are all aware that it’s literally impossible to please everyone and some days we are more animated than other days. the thing that pisses me off the most is that i know that i gave them good service. i was welcoming, polite and professional yet somehow i wasn’t charming or silly enough for them to *truly* enjoy their perfectly cooked mahi mahi.  fucking ridiculous. 

it doesn’t matter how much positive feedback i’ve gotten, my restaurant takes customer complaints so seriously that i was reprimanded and written up.  i feel like i’ll be walking on eggshells now... so help me if i so much as glance at a customer in the completely wrong manner.  

as a side note, i once read a review complaining about a server being “saccharine sweet”.  at what ratio do we need to mix together the sassy and sweet so as not to alarm the general public and to avoid being tattled on?

669,"happy 91st birthday, let me guess how many you have left.","this happened yesterday and i'm still cringing at myself so i thought i would share.  i work at a somewhat classy steak and seafood restaurant, upper-class casual.  my shifts usually go pretty well despite the fact that i am your friendly socially awkward server.  i have pretty severe social anxiety, i'm not good at small talk, at all.   i don't really enjoy chatting with my tables or most of my coworkers.  my brain and my mouth just shut down the channels.  i sometimes stutter or trip over my words, or the right thing to say just disappears.  the coherent casual conversations that i can have in my head never, ever, materialize into successful conversations with others.  i'm not stupid or unorganized, i just have a hard time making connections with people.  want to know about the drinks and specials or the ingredients in the sauces or the preparation, no problem!  want to share your life with me and expect me to reciprocate, don't be surprised if i just stare at you and possibly cock my head like an intrigued dog because you just jammed my gears with your blathering.  

so yesterday a three top comes in about an hour before close, a very old couple and their 30's something grandson, super friendly, a pleasure to serve.  the woman is sharp despite appearing to be very old.  i learn that they are celebrating her birthday.  cool.  her 91st birthday.  awesome, what a feat.  i do my thing, drinks out, orders in, food out, birthday dessert.  

as they are getting up to leave the woman comes over to me as i'm sweeping up the rest of the restaurant.  she said something to the effect of ""thank you for your wonderful service, you are so helpful, kind and charismatic.""  she caught me off guard a bit, i mean, i get a lot of compliments because let's be honest, it's typically a pretty easy job if you can rub a few brain cells together, but she just seemed so sincere i felt like hugging her and i'm not a hugger of strangers.  

wow, i was just moved by a few kind words from a stranger.  let me take that nice warm feeling and just obliterate it.  

so i say ""thank you so much!  that's so nice of you to say, and happy birthday!""

""i plan to have more"" says she.

""yea!?"" i reply, start cringing...  ""one more?...  (oh god, what did i just say, say something else...)  two more?...  (oh jesus fuck what is wrong with you, say something better than that)  three more?..."" 

at this point i think i probably started sweating and laughing awkwardly.  she looked at me with a bit of a sideways glance, as if totally reevaluating her initial impression and we made a few more moments of small talk about staying active, ice dancing, horses and her rapidly encroaching mortality before they left.  ugh.  why brain.  just why.

670,"i don’t know what i want, can you help me with the menu (no tip) “thanks!”","i work at a very very fancy south indian restaurant.   and ngl, i’ve gotten used to being stiffed by deeply traditional indian families.   $4 tip on a $296 3-top?    yeah.  that’s regular.    

but, also, cultures are different.     it’s complicated.  

our indian customers help prove to our white customers just how legit a place we are, and our white customers make us the big checks and the tip money.    messed up, but true.     we need a delicate balance of both.   

but this time it wasn’t.   100% white table.   4-top with two babies around age 3 (we auto-grat at 5, but we can’t count kids in high chairs).    one aged maybe 14 months and the other maybe 40 months    

not just white, but rich white.    rich california tech white.    i’ll get to that.  

they start their night basically saying “mea culpa, we can’t understand your menu.    could you spend a while talking about these foods?”   

and i’m happy to do this.   and i get some little crackers for the babies.    and i work around their allergies (2 vegans, 1 gluten free, 1 “no nightshades” and the rest split 50/50 on “please spicy” and “please no spicy”)

argh!!!!!!    

ok.  i’m a pro.   i can make this work.   i talk them through family style dining.     i talk them through wine pairings and crush it.    all four of the the different wines i bring are received wildly well.  and they were very different, a french chard, a cab franc, a sangiovese, and a cali chard.      all four of them ordered a second or third of my recommendation.  

of course this takes *a lot of time*.      four individual wine conversations takes a while.   double checking ingredient lists with the kitchen takes time.     and also, basically, they let me plan their meal for them because they knew nothing about our specific regional type of food.   perfect!   a chance for me to shine.  i can crush this.    

and i crushed it.  i ordered exactly the right amount of food for them.      and i coursed it perfectly even though our kitchen was busy with a private dining event upstairs.   

i rolled out two-plus hours of food about 5-min at a time, with a perfect balance and rotation of “who can eat what” and also making sure the little kids got frequent exciting new nibbles.  

as a table, they ate almost every bite of every dish, but also had just a tiny bit of room for a small dessert i recc’ed.     which they also loved.   i think i did three plate changes, plus a fourth for dessert.     so that’s a 5-course meal effectively.    

i received multiple “thank you, this was the most incredible meal” compliments.    even the little kids liked me because i played peekaboo with them at the table using my sever tray and that was a big hit.    it was hard not to steal one of those kids, he was just so precocious.   super polite.    he told me he wanted to open the wine, and with his dad’s permission i loosened it and then let him pull the final cork off.    i gave the littlest one a popped champagne cork later to chew (with his mom’s permission).  he chewed it all night like he was in heaven.      

basically best server ever.   

literally no problems.     &gt;$500 bill.  2 hour+ dinner.    tons of work, but well worth it.   

comes time to split, and the four adults split the bill 4-ways.   ok.  fine.    even split.   all four of the credit cards are those heavy fucking credit card that just scream “i have disposable income”.    one of them was literally a “restaurants and travel” platinum points card.   

these are not people who need to pinch any pennies.  

i pick up the checks later though with great interest.    on one of them the guy wrote out on the bill, in little letters, “as i understand it, you don’t tip in india.  but still, here’s $5 just for you.” and he wrote in $5 on his like $135 tab.   

the other three gave me zero dollars.     pure stiff.    

two of them told me on the way out the door how this was one of the best meals they had in years and they couldn’t have chosen the menu or wines without my guidance.    

those two people gave me zero dollars.   

—  

so in case anyone was confused, 
#if you are in america you need to tip.  if it is a high cost of living city like nyc or sf or chicago you need to tip 18-20% baseline.   and no your summer study abroud from cornell in mumbai did not give you the right to stiff me.   and saying “thank you, that was so wonderful” is not a tip.    money is a tip.

671,restaurant adopts all of the policies we suggested.,"this took place about three years ago. the bistro that i used to work at was one of the best lunch spots in town: great sandwiches, great burgers, and classic atmosphere. shortly after we started even opening for lunch, it became extremely popular - especially with those on business lunches from town. during the two years after lunch started being served at this restaurant, it ramped up in popularity directly proportional to time to the steady humming plateau it occupies now.

i have read all sorts of stories on here about chronically understaffed restaurants, and ours was no exception. more so than any other day, sunday was our perpetually skeleton-crew day. fortunately our sunday staff was the best squad you could hope for: myself and the one other server on the floor were very experienced, our busser was there to hustle and make money, and our chef (the only chef that worked during lunch) was *the* guy and as fast and on-point as they come. it took us a few weeks during the busy season for management to even put on a hostess for sunday lunch.

our best efforts were sometimes in vain, because if anything was going on in town that tipped the scales a bit too much, we would simply be overwhelmed. something going on at the city center? slammed beyond capacity. nearby college has parents visiting for some event? forget about it. whenever a situation like this would happen, we would be looking at 25-30 minute times *for sandwiches* from the kitchen. that's not even from the time they walked in - that's the time that it took from when i submitted the order to the kitchen from pos. the chef back there was slinging at max sandwich frequency.

it was a frail situation. always teetering on the edge of disaster. my coworker and i that always worked lunch also worked doubles that day, and we would go have a shot of whiskey and a beer with our 'lunch' every single day just to reset from the real lunch that just took place. then coffee, then water, then listerine, then eye drops, then brush your shoulders off and back to it. order of operations.

at any rate, this experienced server and i knew our managers well, and knew that our opinions carried some decent weight. despite this, whenever we mentioned that lunches were a shit show and that it was sometimes impossible to make people happy, they would retort that we should focus on trying to 'charm' or 'interact' with our guests while they waited, or 'pace things out'. they never wanted to go on a wait because ""people don't want to wait for lunch and they will go somewhere else"".  my thought was, 'well, they are going to have to wait either way, so we might as well have them expect it right up front...'

our managers' mindset was still mired in the ways of our dinner service; more upscale and subtle. somewhat casual, but for the most part, a place that you go to celebrate special occasions. they used this reasoning to suggest that we shouldn't be quoting people a long time or going on a wait, and should instead use the aforementioned serving charms.

there is one huge problem with this - its fucking lunch. people have things to do. when you have to go back to work, another smile from me and attempt at getting you a new drink can only go so far. we started getting complaints consistently. servers 'ignored' me (i see you over there, just no way on god's green earth that i can get to you right now), food took forty minutes yadda yadda. they were all legitimate complaints. 

since i got a job in my field, i quit, but i still talk to the people that work there. they ended up going with 2 chefs on sunday, an extra server, and an extra busser. they also started quoting wait times for people for lunch if they get too busy since they started getting dinged on opentable and tripadvisor.

672,when you and the guests at the table all end up crying...,"this is a good experience story and not a bad one. tonight made every shitty night of serving worth it and i need to share it. 

so my father passed away 10 years ago, this is relevant later. i serve at a popular chain restaurant where the food is all made fresh in house from scratch so despite being a chain it’s quite delicious. i get sat a dad and his young teenage daughter at a booth. i can tell off the bat that they are a super friendly and chatty table, it was a crazy slow night so i was able to have a lot of conversation with them. they were very fun and relaxed so i didn’t even feel like i was serving.  well turns out dad knows one of the original founders of the restaurant and has been a loyal customer for 20 years - he loves the place and likes contributing to a business his friend helped start. by the time they are ordering dessert we have had a great experience, very fun and they loved the food. dad lets his daughter order 4 slices of cheesecake (guess where) to go, which is like $35 worth of dessert lol. 

so daughter goes to bathroom and me &amp; dad are chatting. now this gets kinda personal and i’m not a server to share my life with my guests but we had chatted so much it didn’t feel unusual. he tells me that he’s divorced, he only has his daughter 50% of the time and it’s hard on him. he’s clearly a great and loving dad. he jokes that he tries to be the favorite parent by showering her with gifts (like cheesecake). told me he’s got a new fiancé and a baby on the way. as he was going on about his wonderful daughter i told him that my father had died and that serving tables like them was my absolute favorite. this is true. i have cried many times after serving loving dads. my dad was great and it’s sad but heartwarming to watch other dads be great.

daughter comes back and i’m saying goodbye to them; dad proceeds to ask daughter if she likes him as a dad. she gets all giggly and says very much. i told them that i was going to start crying and needed to walk away and the dad gave me a hug!! i’ve never hugged a guest but it’s also been a long time since i got a dad hug so i needed it :’). i thank them and tell them i loved serving them and proceeded to go in the back and cry lol. they left and i thought that was that.

well my manager comes up to me (her father actually has also passed away, so i had told her about the guests before this had even happened) and tells me that the dad and daughter came up to her, in her words, “bawling.” he told her that i was an asset to the restaurant and that i gave him a hug and he really needed it. but like, i really needed it!!!! so not only did this guy make my night just by being a great dad and leaving me a solid tip, but he gave my manager the greatest compliment about me. this has made me so emotional in a good way. this night made every bad shift worth it. 

i know this sub is mostly stories about horrible guests and i love reading them but i had to share this. i honestly love being a server, it makes me happy to make other people happy, and tonight reminded me why this job can be so special. i hope you all experience guests as great as mine. :) ",OVOsimba716,tfys
673,"""i want to see the manager!"" sure thing buddy.","i think this fits here, if only because the servers in this sub would appreciate it.

20 years ago, my mother opened up a higher-end restaurant with a partner.  her partner was head chef, she supplied the start-up money, and worked there as well. 

(for context, this incident was several years into the business, and the restaurant was barely staying above water, and my mother had lost all patience for accommodating shitbags.) 

&amp;#x200b;

one night running register, my mother noticed on the cc slip that a party had left a \~1% tip on a $200+ meal.  on top of this they were being incredible assholes to the wait staff.  my mother stopped them on the way out and asked them not to return based on their tip/behavior.

of course, the group immediately demanded to speak to the manager. 

""sure thing"", my mother said.  she went in the back, smoked a cigarette, then came back out.

""i'm the manager, how may i help you?"" with a shit eating grin.

of course, this didn't go over well at all.  but the jackasses thought they had an ace up their sleeve.  ""we want to see the owner!""  

you see, the restaurant was named after her partner, and they assumed that he must be the owner.

""absolutely! "", my mother said.  she then went in the back, smoked another cigarette, and came back out again.

""hi, i'm the owner, how can i help you?""

i’m solo in the restaurant, have 3 three tops, and a boatload of to go orders. no biggie. i’ve been doing this for almost 15 years. i’m having a good time with my tables &amp; even the postbuddies and doorrun guys.

so, at minimum, ten minutes had passed since the tea had been poured &amp; he was flustered that the tea in the cup was no longer hot. what was in the pot was still blisteringly hot (i poured it into a cup and drank it because i needed all of caffeine at that point)

being able now to have confidence with my social and salesman skills, but i've lost most of my jobs for bad manners to supervisors (i get ironic when i find something extra stupid and it's not from a customer ^(i know it's potentially worse but meh, i've once said ""wtf"" to my supervisor totally worth it btw)) or because of low tray-skills and slow service sometimes (these fully filled glasses that i don't want to spill) .

**anyways, i recently got a new job as a server assistant at this classy coffee place.**

it has been a while now that i didn't work as a server due to my last experience *(had this really cool well paid job and the bartenders one day gave me so much shit that one order was late for 42minutes while i didn't go to my supervisor to complain about them because i thought i had it under control* *^(no shit, i didn't)**\*\*\*\*. then i didn't want to work as a server for a while and now i'm having again trouble with the tray, nothing that can't be fixed with a little more practise)*

back to my new job, it's been one week since i legitimately started working there and there is this one server (i'll call him server a) that he just hates my guts.

i mean, i've tried to talk to him in case we have something in common, but nothing at all. he just hates me.

**it may have been my fault** since last week when on a monday late-night (first day at work, first time i meet him) we had 1 table of customers, i had asked my best friend to come for a beer (so he would drive me home because when i work late there is no bus and i have to walk for more than an hour just so i can get home). he (the best friend) comes with another friend of ours, and while i serve them water i happened to sit for a while to show them (and read for the first time) the catalog.

( i ^(hopefully) will be a server as well there sooner or later, so i seized the opportunity to read this with my friends. terrible idea to **sit** though)

**server a** happened to see me (ofc) and then we spent that last half hour of my shift discussing with the bartender what we should and we shouldn't do at this job, while server a was mostly listening *(i don't quite remember him saying anything at all but i may be wrong)*. i proceeded drinking a beer with my friends and when i asked for my daily tips he said that he will *""tip me next time""*. fun fact, each time i get the last times tips, but only with this guy (server a). every other server will tip any assistant on the same day, including me. and it's funny, because i'm in a really hard financial state and i need the tips to survive until my next shift. anyhow..

since then, last night when we had no tables at all and he would still be mad at me for cracking some jokes with the sous-chef a couple of times (when i literally had nothing to to atm) and delaying my work in the kitchen half a minute or something. i even apologised two times for ""making him mad"". i just don't know how to handle this guy... everyone else there either loves me or at least behaves very friendly, but server a even scratches his neck when talking to me.

i really need this job, but i'm seriously afraid that he will undermine me to our boss. what should i do?

p.s.; do correct my english if you find any mistakes. edit: i wan't to get better since it's not my first language.

to preface, i work at a hibachi restaurant where, if you aren’t familiar, a chef cooks food in front of the customers on a japanese-style grill. our restaurant is inconveniently placed near a mega church. every sunday morning, without fail, church-goers and their heathen children occupy our restaurant in masses directly after church ends at ten am. to give you a sense of how wild this is, not only do they start banging at the door minutes before we open, but there’s literally so many of them that each of the 8 grills we use are filled with around 12 people easily by 11 am (not to mention our six four-seater dinning tables.) it should also be noted that we are severely understaffed. we have four servers and three hibachi chefs, one of them being the owner (we also only have one sushi chef who is the other owner and often has to leave her station to help serve and do cash transactions.) it is not unusual for a server to handle around 40 to 45 customers at a time on sundays. keeping all this mayhem in mind, customers are absolute maniacs to our staff. 

which brings us to this insane customer. i recognized that i had served her before. i remembered that she was unfriendly and didn’t tip, so i knew i would encounter a similar exchange this time, but it in no way prepared me for what she was about to order. i greeted her and the other customers sitting with her at the grill as upbeat as i could in the midst of the mayhem, but that didn’t matter to her. 

i should mention before i tell you what she ordered that we also have a chinese menu. everything on the chinese menu is cooked in the kitchen but you can still have the rice that comes with it cooked on the grill. we usually discourage large groups of people from ordering it at the grill because they’re honestly taking up space there and really only want the grill rice (can’t blame them tho, it’s way better than the kitchen rice.) this customer ordered off the chinese menu and since she was the only one, i let her, trying to make a mental note that i would have to find time to run this food out to her from the kitchen (something many servers easily forget when we’re busy.) but that’s not all. she also wanted exactly this:

- two veggie rolls, deep fried, add cream cheese before the chef arrives.
- two soups (which are extra if you’re not ordering hibachi) extra hot
- water and sprite
- side of vegetables (no onion, no mushroom) from the grill.

i immediately hate her. but i remain friendly. i bring her her two drinks. i make all the soup and salad for the rest of the customers at the grill and then i remembered just in time that this idiot wants extra hot soup for some reason, so pop them in the microwave for thirty seconds (honestly, what other ways did i have to heat up soup during all this?) when i put her soups in front of her, she looks me in my eyes and asks me to put one if them in a to go cup. i swear my face must have been blank as hell as i tried my hardest to cover my bewilderment. why did she want it extra hot if she’s not going to eat it now????

i bring her the two sushi rolls, and guess what, my friends? she wants one of them in a to go box. 

my other grill needs refills.
one of my tables need their checks.
my other table is waiting on their food.

inhale. exhale.

i box the sushi. i bring it.

“i need it in a bag.” 
i bag it. i bring it.
“are there chopsticks in there?”
how stupid of me to forget.

the chef comes out, cooks everyone’s food, i take care of my other customers and bring out her chinese food. he gets done cooking, i check on everyone, ask if they need anything, she specifically says she’s fine. i return with the checks and even bring to go boxes because most people need them and i already know she’s going to ask.

“to go sprite?”
you already no who asked.
i bring the sprite.
“i need to go sauces.”
i bring them. 
“i need another bag.”

i promise you, every single request she has made has been devoid of please or thank you, and she remains without any kindness in her voice nor her face. it’s all blunt and dead-pan. she only asks for things after i have returned with her previous request, none are asked for at the same time.

i’m sure it won’t surprise you that she didn’t leave one red cent for a tip. i highly regret saying “thank you, have a nice day!” as she was walking out of the restaurant, but what keeps me up at night is her saying, “yes, ma’am. you too.” like... dont say that shit to me, knowing i’ve busted my ass for you and knowing i’m about to open this book and find that you’ve scratched out the tip line, you walking nightmare.

anyway, i obviously haven’t gotten over it completely and won’t be serving her in the event she crawls from under her troll bridge and slithers back into our establishment.

tl;dr : sundays are wrecking my knees and customers want to watch me die slowly via complicated orders and $0 tips. particularly one customer who doesn’t know you can ask for multiple things at one time.",sh3lby333,tfys
680,woman demanded i sell my ring,"so i work at a high end sushi restaurant in oklahoma as a host (this is the closest reddit i could find so i’m sorry) this happened 2/28/19 so very fresh on my mind, i had sat this table of 2 middle aged women cause it was “girls night” i go down the back line to let the server know the table and how many people, i go back up to the host stand and i’m just trying to bide my time because it’s very cold out and no one wants sushi, not even five minutes later one of the ladies walk to the host stand and she notices a ring i have on my index finger, (it’s a tungsten ring and it has a purple layer on the outside holding specs of tungsten and it looks like stars, and my girlfriend got it for me as a valentine’s day gift) and my girlfriend and i are close to our 2 year anniversary
dl-demanding lady and me 

dl“sweetheart that is a beautiful ring” 

me”thank you ma’am, my girlfriend got it for me as     a valentine’s day gift” 

dl”how much would you sell it for”

me”i’m sorry ma’am, i wouldn’t sell it for anything” 

dl”come on, you’re young and your relationship won’t last anyway” 

me”ma’am, if the only thing you came up here to do was try to buy my ring it’s not gonna happen” 

dl(at a slightly higher volume) “just give me a price kid i’m sure you have a price” 

me”sure, how does a thousand dollars sound?” 

dl(slightly red in the face)”that’s ridiculous, i could find it cheeper elsewhere” 

me(almost cocky and very sarcastic)” well ma’am good luck in you’re search but you’re not buying this ring off my finger, so enjoy the rest of your meal” 

she stormed off and apparently asked the server to speak to my manager to demand, “that “little shit” should be fired for the way he speaks to customers” luckily we have cameras with audio and the restaurant was quiet to when the video was played and audio was heard, i was told i was completely in the right but to “cut the sarcasm”",Jlander105,tfys
681,recently hired at a fine dining restaurant; was super excited and now feeling very unsure,"i've been a server for almost 6 years and i've worked at 4 different establishments. i've worked at a popular seafood chain (think scarlet crustacean) for over a year until now. i've always been a very confident and capable server and have been told by both managers and guests consistently that i'm skilled at what i do.

&amp;#x200b;

i just recently moved to a new area and landed a job at a fine dining restaurant that several people recommended i work at. the interview process was very intense and selective, but i somehow made it and was hired. my former coworkers were so happy and excited for me because apparently servers there make awesome money ($200-400 per night ""easily""). my orientation experience was great, i felt like i would fit in perfectly, and have been looking forward and raving about it for weeks. after my first training shift things went sour.

&amp;#x200b;

there are multiple, 6-page, fully written exams at the start of each training shift. i have to study almost 4 hours per night for them... it's an insane and unnecessary amount of information. like the full history of one of the paintings on the wall or the 10+ specific ingredients in the bbq sauce. it's seriously stressing me out. 

&amp;#x200b;

my last two training shifts were 8+ hours long. gave me a much closer look at how things run and just completely changed my view of the place; essentially killed my vibe. coworkers are extremely impatient and cold to one another, management is militant and condescending, and the way things are done just seems way, way more difficult and complicated than it really has to be. there are a million little details to remember that i simply cannot pick up on immediately. my trainers after day one have acted very snappy, exasperated and have made me feel like an idiot for not knowing how to do things that i simply  haven't been trained to do yet. the amount of detail that goes into every table is beyond what i imagined. and it must be executed perfectly \*or else\*. 

&amp;#x200b;

i don't know. almost everyone who works there seemed stressed, annoyed with one another, snobby, and very tense. this is a stark contrast to everywhere i have worked where there has been a friendly and helpful atmosphere, even on really chaotic nights where everyone is weeded and shit hits the fan. the shifts here are a lot of work and serving food is treated like a life or death situation. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm so conflicted.... the money is amazing. and i just got my own new place and rent is expensive. everyone told me i was lucky to get this job and it's a great opportunity. but the past week or so of training has already been negatively affecting my mental state. i was so incredibly excited for this and now i'm really anxious and absolutely dreading my next training shift tomorrow. maybe i wasn't cut out for this. even if i'm making insane money, is it going to be worth my mental health? should i stick it out and see if it gets better? or is this just not a good fit for me?

&amp;#x200b;

can anyone offer a similar experience or advice?

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: was hyped for a new job at a fine dining restaurant, but now getting an overall bad vibe and not sure if i'm a good fit. conflicted because the money is amazing.",winter-anderson,tfys
682,what is your biggest pet peeve as a server?,"mine is easily people paying with $100 bills for small checks. 

i work in a place that is moderately priced, ppa is around $30 with some cheaper kids options. checks are usually around $50-$70 during lunch and $120-$150 during dinner. 

after years of doing this its almost comical how often someone pays for their $35 check with a $100 bill and then leaves a terrible tip. 

who purposely carries $100 bills in this day and age? even if you want to be a great server and bring in a bank, at my place it gets wiped out after about an hour with your first two or three elderly tables paying with $100 bills. ",ServePro,tfys

684,think i'll be alright?,"had to call out of work today. literally only like the 2nd time i've called out since i started with them 2013. all the rest i get my shift covered. 

had a steak dinner last night and got sick from it. woke up just a few hours after i went to bed with excruciating stomach pain and throwing up every 20 minutes, also resulting in not being able to get  anymore sleep. 

but no one could cover me and had a cocktail shift which basically is the most important shift on the floor since your responsible for like a 15 table section by yourself. i just couldn't do it so i called out but i said i'd go to urgent care and get a doctor's note, they didn't ask me i just offered to reassure them. 

and just my luck, since i don't have insurance i couldn't find my carecredit card, so i didn't go. don't want to pay out of pocket since i have a very high 6-month car insurance due the middle of this month i need to save for. 

so i feel very bad about this situation and don't want them to think i'm bullshitting them. but i have been a very loyal employee since the start and am considered one of the best servers we have with the most experience.

686,"not a customer, management","i’ve been working at at restaurant for two years since i was 18 (been in hospo for 9 years). i’m now 20 and struggling in the same job i used to be fantastic at. 

recently we got really slow and we had 5 waitstaff have quit over the last 12 months and none of them have been replaced. we used to have 6 waitstaff, a bar manager, four chefs and a dishy. our staff is now at 3 wait staff, our bar manager, two chefs and a dishy. 

when our bar manager left our chef/son of owner decided he would be the bar manager - didn’t replace the chef and isn’t very good at it. so now we only have two people on the floor a night (if that) when we used to have three, and my bar manager doesn’t manager the place? he asks me all the questions and to help in the bar but as soon as i put my name forward to actually do the bar so he can go back to the kitchen he decides that this is what he wants to do. 

many people have come in with cvs and i’ve given him a couple of people that needed jobs but still we’ve had no new hire in four months. 

recently i got hit with glandular fever and have been wiped out especially when it’s just me on the floor alone on a saturday night when we’re fully booked. i’ve been asked for him to hire anyone for the last four months but he either comes up with excuses why or tells me it’s none of my business - i try to explain that it is my business as we’ve been understaffed for 4 months and i’m not being compensated for doing the job of 2-3 people + half of his responsibilities!! he always asks me about id and tables on the other side of the restaurant when it’s his job to manage the restaurant. i’ve even offered to take a role like “floor manager” so he can focus on the bar but he refuses to treat me like anything more than a waitress despite doing most of his work or putting out his fires. 

he’s never thankful for me doing him favours when he decides to talk to tables for half an hour and never warns us when he’s just leaving or going to the bathroom (for 40 minutes), or going to help the kitchen for the next hour.

i explained this to his dad and my big boss after he’d had said “come to me with any problems” and he said that my manager was doing a fine job and that the jobs were always done. i try to explain that they are done because i do them and he doesn’t care. i told him if they don’t hire more staff i’d quit because it’s very embarrassing not having enough staff and being over worked and under delivering to customers. i’ve tried to explain that a lot of customers have commented on the downward shift of our service but they don’t care they say they’ve had “the best customer feedback in years” and i try to explain that’s probably coming from the three tables my manager actually talks to while the rest of the restaurant suffers. 

the solution to this is my bar manager decides that he will now do a section of the restaurant and the bar and the kitchen. apparently this is more reasonable than me helping out at the bar. the problem is he can’t even do what he’s doing now and he’s giving himself more responsibility, i tried to explain it’s actually easier for him to do one job and do it properly instead of half adding three jobs but he wants to prove he can do it. 

legally he’s the bar manager and gets very specific about me being behind the bar without him despite having worked at our other bar down the road every weekend for a year. one of his excuses to hiring more staff is that they can’t afford it yet instead of me being behind the bar and training someone on the floor instead he takes other -less experienced - bartenders from the bar to work the bar at the restaurant so that he can work on the floor, this is a problem because they don’t know how we do drinks, where anything is, how to use the till or take bookings, they become the face and they have no idea what they’re doing. he also refuses to train them to do any of that or learn how to wait the floor. so instead of asking my manager they ask me and i tell them what to do and i get the nickname “boss” from the bartenders i work with down the roads.

me and the other waitstaff are all sick of waiting for more staff that never turn up but i’m the only one to call him out on it when he does shit on the floor that is not only wrong but just basic waiting stuff like cutlery?? and he tells me to ignore his section and i do - but i can’t ignore them when they come up to me because none of them have water and 4 tables need to order and two tables have been sat down without menus for 20 minutes. when i check where my manager is he’s in the kitchen and hasn’t told anyone that he’s going to be there for the next hour and someone just has to cover his section. 

it’s awful and yes i’m trying to quit but i also need to pay rent and finding another job (outside of hospo) is really hard. 

im completing my dm cert at the moment and will be done soon but they don’t even seem interested in having me as the dm then. ",touristmeg,tfys
687,customers walked out because they had shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese.,"not a long story as i was the expo for the night so i wasn't at the table to see everything that happened. apparently one of our tables started making a fit that they didn't get sliced cheddar cheese on their burger but got shredded cheese instead. our manager went out to talk to them trying to make them happy but he told them we didn't have any sliced cheddar only shredded. but we do have other cheeses that are in slices. once they heard that they got up and walked out with out paying.

688,boss gets mad customer cant read so server has to pay.,"this is a text from the owners wife at the restaurant i work at. we have a coupon that goes out every year that gives customers 20% off. on this coupon it also states very clearly that 18% gratuity will be added to all checks that use this coupon. 
not only that but once the receipt is printed it states gratuity added, and additional tip right on both merchant and customer copies. yet the owners wife decided she would reply (pretending to be the owner.) i can guarantee any ""refunds"" went into her pocket for their next vacation...

anywho this was sent out to less then half the staff members, one of them being a server who cant work atm because he hurt his hand in a snowmobiling accident. so staff was charged at the end of the night with bartenders who do payouts instructed to not give anyone their money until they are paid up. 

i am so disappointed in the owners right now and  honestly find it sickening that she thinks she can talk to her stuff so disrespectfully time and time again when all she does is banquets...shes a joke.  

enjoy the rest!


i am so disappointed with those who took advantage of the restaurant by taking double gratuity
moving forward 
no gratuity will be added to any check at any time 
at any time
at any time 
no exceptions 
without  a signature on the check from t*** or p*****
in the future this violation of guests 
will result in the total tip being returned to guests and you will no longer work at s**

me: what's the problem?

hostess: someone took the wrong to go order. 

oh fuck. 

she follows me to the front where i meet customer. he's nice but we're both confused. 

the other host has already gone home, so i don't know the whole story. but customer says he called to put in an order under customer 1. we check the closed orders and yeah, someone claimed to be customer 1 came in and paid cash. 

thankfully the guy in front of me was cool and hadn't already prepaid. i had the order remade and gave the guy a discount for having to wait. 

first time in my entire restaurant history that someone else came in, paid, and took someone else's order. we confirm everything so i don't know what happened. 

at the end of the night, we had one to go order that hadn't been picked up. the two names were similar but one was $30 and customer 1 was almost $60 (before the discount), so as far as i can tell, i made money off the fuck up.

696,they will be here in like 15 minutes!,"okay this is a doozy so bare with me. i’m on my way home from work as i’m writing this and i’m still absolutely blown away that this happened tonight. 

i work at a very small restaurant, we don’t take reservations, our cuisine takes about 45 minutes. with only 25 seats total, table and bar, we need to fill every spot.

today a group of 4 girls came in and put their name on the waitlist. we weren’t too crazy at the time because our rush hadn’t really started yet. the wait was about 25 for them, not bad! then they said they would actually be 6. luckily for them it would still work out. so comes time to seat them, they are actually 7, plus a dog....

i of course asked if it was a service dog to which the girl replied “of course she is! this is ellie belly isn’t she just the cutest?!” in the loudest most shrill voice you could possibly imagine. 

we get them down at a table for 6 but there’s a bench on one side so they comfortably squeeze 4 on there no problem. 

once sat, they proceed to order enough food to feed a small army, plus 4 bottles of wine. as i’m bring glasses over, the girl with the dog says oh we have more people coming can we have an extra table? i said at the moment there wasn’t another available, but when one came up they could have it. 

a couple then walks in and says they will be two, since i had just promised the next available 2 top to shrill dog girl i offered them two spots at the bar. they weren’t happy about it, and asked why they couldn’t have the table that was almost done. i explained the situation and promised them the next table that would be up in about 25. they unhappily agreed. 

so, table comes available and i scoot it up to the girls and ask when their friends will be arriving. “so soon! until then elloise can sit here” says shrill dog girl, and she promptly places cute little ellie belly in the seat next to her. 

the couple at the bar was understandably frustrated. 

at this point i’m beginning to question whether or not they actually have more friends coming. 15 minutes go by and no one has arrived. luckily i was able to get the couple at the bar down at a table, and we exchange disbelief that a dog is taking up an entire table in the restaurant. our rush is now starting, a very nice older couple walks in for a table for two. i had just sat the rest of our tables with another large group, so it will be quite awhile and offer them bar seats. they glance at the dog taking up a table, and say they will wait for a table.

again we approach shrill dog girl and ask when the rest of her party is arriving, since this couple would love a table if she thinks they might not be coming. by this time the dog has had its own table for about 30 minutes. “just like 15 more minutes i promise!!”

as my other server is walking by, she hears shrill dog girl say “oh gosh no i made that up, no one is coming” to one of her friends.

are you fucking kidding me bitch

i was livid. some of the girls see myself and the server staring angrily at them and start loudly proclaiming that their friends liz and rob are coming. they actually act appalled that we are upset that a dog has now had its own table for 45 fucking minutes. i mean, how dare we be upset?!? who do we think we are right? 

an hour and a half later, someone does arrive, but only after two other girls have left, so they still didn’t need the table!!!!

needless to say we auto grated the shit out of their $500 check. no way am i going to let some entitled princess fuck with my tips because she thinks her dog should have its own table.

tldr girl lies and says she has friends joining so her dog can have its own table

servers could not talk to the host/hostess because they would complain about not getting tables. we had a waitress curse out and threaten to stab a hostess in the parking lot after work if she didn't give her tables. she was 16 and really short/petite. she started crying and my manager brought her to the office and coaxed the story out of her. our manager was furious and brought in the waitress for her side of the story. waitresses defense was, ""that little bitch wasn't giving me any tables."" manager cursed her out while screaming and fired her on the spot.

2) women are not allowed to leave alone

girls could not leave without being walked out. some did anyway but were reprimanded for it. we carry cash, servers carry a lot which makes us targets. anyway a waitress left work and was attacked in the parking lot. the guy tried pushing her into her own car to kidnap her. a cook was outside smoking but he was in a fenced in area that had barbed wire at the top so he just screamed for help and rattled the fence.

kinda wish i saw this but an onslaught of cooks, prep-guys and dishwashers came running out, about 12-15, and charged the guy. managers, busboys, and waiters came out a couple of seconds later as they were not in the back kitchen where the door was.

about 25 grown men were chasing this asshole down the street. guy ran to a mechanic shop and hid under one of the cars to not get lynched to death. cops were called and the guy was arrested.

===

any stories you guys have about specific rules or have similar rules to what i stated? please share :d

699,"customer steals tip off of the table, waitress ""convinces"" him to bring it back.","one of my favorite coworkers is a woman who's been serving for over 30 years. she's not well liked by many because she's meaner than a bag of piranhas, but if you can fire back (and do your job right) she'll respect you and be your best friend.

she told me a story today from back in the 80s when she first started. she sees this guy come in wearing a real nice suit, and she watches him take the cash someone left as a tip, right off of the damn table as she's going back into the kitchen. she walks up to him and says ""i saw you take that. i want that money back on the damn table when i get back out here."" 

she returns to the floor after a minute holding a pitcher of water. lo and behold, the money isn't there. as she passes the table, she ""trips"" and dumps this pitcher of ice water all over this guy in his nice suit (in the middle of a michigan winter). she goes into a fake bout of apologetics

""oh my goodness i'm so sorry sir! i'm so sorry!""

she leans in and whispers: ""i'll be back in a minute with the coffee motherfucker.""

she comes out a minute later, coffee pot in hand, to find that her money has mysteriously reappeared.",IBlameLiam,tfys
700,host stealing money from servers,"hey y’all. i’m on mobile so sorry for formatting errors. i also just had this happen, so i’m still a bit irritated (well, more than a bit). tl;dr at the end, this one’s a long one!

i work at an emerald wednesday, and since we’ve recently changed the menu and created a two-for-twenty deal, business has been great. i mean, back to $150-$200 on a friday/saturday night kinda great. our restaurant is pretty small, so that’s a really good night meaning all tables are full, kitchen is five pages deep, etc. 

last night was very busy. i clocked in and was immediately triple sat at 3:45. four to five tables in my section at a time until about 8:30, and i finally stopped taking tables at 9:30. last night though, i noticed my cash tips were lacking. lacking to the point that my managers had to swipe me out (if we make under 10% in cash tips total, we need manager approval to cash out so we aren’t claiming tips incorrectly). i was stiffed a fair amount, but i figured we were busy and that my service may have been sub par. 

tonight though, i came in at 3:45 again and it was busy (church people rush) and i was double sat. it was steady after that until about 7:30, and i noticed that i was being stiffed a lot. like, six tables, no tip, but i thought i had seen them take out cash and put it in the books. but i guess not, right?

wrong. 

i told one of my server friends (carly) about how i was stiffed, and she said she was stiffed a lot tonight and last night too. another server(jessie) overheard us, and she said the same. in fact, a table jessie saw put the cash for the bill in the book, when she went to grab the payment after the host has bussed the table, the payment was completely gone. 

so we also have one newer host (dumbass) , 17, and he’s been rushing to bus tables. i mean racing you to your table at times. i just though ya know, maybe he wants to stay busy? stolen tips has never been an issue before in the past two years i’ve worked there, so i thought nothing of it. the guy that trained dumbass was also on top of keeping tables clear since our restaurant is small. so maybe dumbass just wanted to make sure we had open tables in each section, and maybe he learned well from the fantastic host that trained him!

well, after talking to the other two servers, we set dumbass up because we realized he was the only one bussing tables last night and tonight. jessie put $2 on a dirty table, and after he cleaned it, it was gone. i decided to up the stakes. i had a table pay with a card, and once i collected the card payment ($34 and some change) i placed a book with the same check but no credit card slip on the table, and that check book was filled with $42 in cash. i told my manager about the plan too and even marked the bills. 

i went to the back to break down the drink station and finish my side work. once i saw dumbass come back with that tables dishes. i went out and i grabbed the book. and it was empty. $42 gone. so i immediately showed the manager, and she was like okay let’s get the ball rolling. i went outside to calm
down because i was mad as all hell, so me and carly went outside to vent. next thing i know, dumbass and manager are coming outside to discuss the situation. the conversation goes as follows. 

me - me, m - manager, d - dumbass

m: you need to apologize to beckersbex right now and give her the money you owed. 

*tries to hand back $5-$7 in $1 bills*

me: i don’t think this is right. i know there was $40 at least in the book, and all of that was gone after you bussed the table. 

d: no, this is all i took. 

me: i know for a fact that i put that money in there, i showed m too, so i need that back. 

m:  i need you to give that money back to her or you’re stealing from the restaurant, so i’ll have to call the police. 

d: so you just want me to take money out of my wallet? i didn’t take all that. 

m: if that’s what it takes. we both know it was missing. so return it or i’ll call the cops. 

d: *gives money back to me* whatever, sorry. 

me: yeah whatever bro. 

after this i went back inside and dumbass went home. my manager called the gm to explain the situation and yeah. i firmly he believe dumbass is fired for sure. if he’s not, i’m leaving. i won’t work with someone that will steal my money. 

we have no cameras in the dining room, so anything else he stole will not be accounted for and i’m just shit out of luck evidently. along with the other servers. we’re hoping this will get cameras in the dining room and a strict policy or something, maybe compensation for the lost tips we know were stolen. idk though. 

tl;dr: new dumbass host starts stealing cash tips from servers. we set him up and he tries to lie, ends up paying the known stolen money back to us. pretty sure he’s fired. ",BeckersBex,tfys
701,interview at a fancy restaurant with no food service experience. tips?,"currently a college student and i have an admin job where i go to just once a week. i have 3 years of experience working in retail so i am familiar with customer service and all that jazz.

i recently decided to start applying at restaurants because of flexibility (i can only work weekends) and great money. this week, i have an interview with a fancy restaurant by the ocean in my town as a host.

first of all, what do i wear? the last time i was at that restaurant was two years ago so i forgot what their attire is. second, if i do get the job, is it worth it? i’ve heard customers can be 10x worse than retail. my last retail job was super fun because of coworkers and managers that i still consider family.  i’m not planning to stay very long either because i have an out of state summer internship in june.

any advice/tips will help thanks!",milkteaketo,tfys
702,customer assaulted my server,"not sure if i can post this here, as a chef and not a server, but feck it.
apologies in advance for any formatting issues.

tldr; server assaulted, customer refused to leave. i slammed a cleaver into his table and he left.

i work as a chef in a gastro-pub and for whatever reason on this night i happened to be the most senior member of staff in the building. it was mid-week and the manager had taken the day off and the senior bartender was on his break on top of that before this episode we only had a doorman for the weekends.

so it's a quiet enough night with just me and the kp in the kitchen while there's one waitress and bartender foh. our kitchen is on the 2nd floor whilst the bar is on the ground floor so we use a dumb waiter to send food and intercom phone to communicate.

around 1930 the phone rings and the bartender tells there's a customer getting a lil handsy with the waitress and making life comments. so i tell him to ask the customer to leave. about five minutes later the bartender rings back and informs me the customer is refusing to leave and has ""armed"" himself with a steak knife. so at this point i'm i decide that as senior staff i should deal with the situation personally and come down to the bar to confront the customer. but before i left the kitchen i placed my cleaver on the dumb waiter and sent it to the bar.

so by this time we've moved the handful of customers away from this gentleman and i try to talk to him but instead he keeps waving the knife at me. so i take the cleaver from the dumb waiter and proceed to slam it down into the table beside this gentleman's hand. 

that got him to his senses and he decided it was best for his health to leave. fortunately he forgot his wallet+id which we were able to provide to the police. 

we wrapped food earlier that night, and numerous shots we had.",UltimatumofSC,tfys
703,happy hour,"i work at a restaurant that has happy hour deals on appetizers and drinks. like most places to get happy hour prices you have to order when its happy hour. 

i had a table of 2 come in over an hour before happy hour started and ordered some apps and drinks. all was going well they were enjoying their food and their drinks and seemed happy. at one point i went to check on them (still before happy hour) and they asked if happy hour started at 10 so i told them what time  happy hour started. they asked me if i could adjust their bill so that they were able go get happy hour prices on everything. even though i knew that we wouldn't do that i went and asked my manager about it. as soon as i asked she just went ahead and told me she would go talk to them.

 i went back up to them with their check and explained to them that i was sorry but didn't have control over the situation and couldn't discount it at all. they seemed fine still asked for to go drinks and boxes which i happily brought. 

they ended up paying at the table and filled out a survey saying it was completely ridiculous and unprofessional that we wouldnt give them happy hour prices when it wasn't happy hour. they also left no tip on $100. ",idunnkno,tfys
704,i always get the verbal abuse from people,"so i have worked with my company since i was 16 or 17. i don’t remember when i started, but i’m 22 now and it’s been a while. we’re a fast-casual bbq place, which is only available in my state. we also have a drive thru, which is what i usually work. we were training other people as managers for a new store opening, and i’m also in training to be a manager, but my training is less important because i’m remaining at our store. 

also, i’m on mobile, and i’m mostly a lurker but sometimes i comment, first time poster. so sorry about the formatting. tldr at the bottom. 


anyways, it was a reaaaally busy night. i’m talking, we did probably $15,000 or more. we sold out of our ribs, despite loading way more than we needed to cook. but they’re amazing so it makes sense people buy them. 

i was having a tough time on the drive thru, so one of the other managers in training (who is a saint and who i have a girl crush on) offered to take my headset while i cashed out and helped out on the floor. 

i come back after a short period of time because i notice they’re swamped, and i’m really good at checking and bagging food quickly and sending people on their way. mit and i make a wonderful team. until this woman is at the window. 

mit will be manager in training, me will of course be myself, and ol will be onion lady. 

i had just finished packing food for ol when mit puts someone on hold, and hands out the food. apparently, ol had been horrible at the speaker. we sold out of ribs, so she settled for pork, which is almost the same because our ribs are pork as well. 

ol accepts her food by yanking it out of mit’s hands, and she and i share a look with each other, complete with eye rolls. then, mit goes back to her order-taking, while i bag. i notice ol has not left, as our time is at nine. minutes. for window time alone. 

ol is dead. ass. going through her entire order. at. the. window!!!!

i ignore this, although i’m upset because our drive thru times are meant to be under 5 minutes and my average is now at 8, and steadily going up because of this woman. ol honks four or five times to get my attention, so i go to the window;

me: yes ma’am, are you missing something?

ol: *holding a 3 oz cup of onions* first you fuckers charge me for a quart of onion sticks, when i wanted four half pints of raw onions, which i know you don’t charge for, and you give me this?! this is bullshit!

me: four half pints is a lot of onions, ma’am. that’s a quart of raw onions. we don’t charge for small amounts of extras but if you want four half pints, i’ll happily charge you-

ol: no!!! you guys always give them to me for free. i want them now

me: no, we don’t. but if you pull forward so mit can assist the others behind you, i’ll gladly grab you a pint of onions at no charge so you can go home happy. 

ol: i have been waiting in line for twenty minutes and now you want me to wait even longer so you can go get me what i originally asked for???!

me: *not shaken* yes. the people behind you have also been in line as long as you. i’m sorry it’s been so long, but it’s clearly very busy, and if you just pull forward so we can cash out the next car, i’d be more than happy to grab the onions. 

ol: i’m not pulling forward until i get them

me: then i’m not getting them. *shrug* you’re driving our ticket time up, and being verbally abusive, i don’t appreciate it. so either pull forward or you and i can continue this lovely chat while your food gets cold. 

ol has this look on her face. confusion and anger mixed together. i’m honestly very amused. she can’t ask for a manager, because i am also training to be a manager. so she’s stuck. i’ve been here a long while, and i’ve dealt with abusive customers since day one. i’m hollow now. uncrushable. 

mit, noticing that she’s yelling, comes to the window and asks what the problem is. 

ol: this bitch won’t get me my onions. 

mit: pull forward and she will. we have to assist other cars too, ma’am. 

ol: this is ridiculous!! *pulls out phone, takes a picture of the window, which has our owner’s number on it* i’m calling the owner. 

me: okay. pull forward and call him, i’ll grab your onions and if you want i’ll talk to him on the phone too. (the owner loves me, so i’m not a bit worried about him not taking my side. especially in the case of verbal abuse)

ol once again makes the confused-angry face, and finally, after our window time is at fifteen minutes, pulls forward. i go to get a pint from the kitchen, and fill it with onions. as i leave the building, i notice ol is not where i told her to park. turns out, she had peeled out of the parking lot in a fit of rage, she didn’t even stop at the stop sign lmao. there were tire marks leading out, mit told me she almost hit somebody in her blind rage. 

not even five minutes later we get a call from the owner on mit’s cell phone. mit took the blame for *my* wrong doing. i took the phone from her, explained what actually happened, and how mit did nothing but take her order and hand the food out the first time. 

our owner explained how she told him she’s never coming back, and how next time something like that happens, we should have offered a free dessert with their meal because we ran out. i told him i understood, and that i would do better next time. 
funny thing is, i always offer my customers a big smile and free desserts if i fuck up or if i take too long. sometimes, i even give them their meal as my own for free. but i won’t do it for assholes. sorry not sorry. 

funny thing is, she came back a week later, and once she saw me in the drive thru window, pulled out of the parking lot again without paying for her food or receiving it. i haven’t seen her since lol.

711,yell at my cooks? banned.,"okay so this didn't happen to me exactly, but me and my boss both hated this woman equally.

most people in food service have that one customer that they absolutely despise. my boss and i had one we shared (c). this lady was a regular (as in at least once or twice a week, at a pizza place).

every time she ordered something, she would come in and try to find something wrong with her order just to get freebies and refunds. and she always paid in not-quite-exact change, always short, and she would seem to expect us to cover for the difference.

we hated her with a passion.

one day, while my boss was putting away supplies from the delivery truck that had come in, the cook (a total sweetheart) was answering the phones when c walks in and asks for her pizza. the cook, still on the phone, asks her to hold on a minute while she finishes the call, and she would get my boss so he could have her pay for the order.

c flips the f*ck out. she starts yelling so loud at the cook that my boss can hear her from the other side of the store, over the triple oven (which by itself is extremely loud). my boss comes up, and asks what the problem is. c says that the cook isn't helping her, and demands to be compensated for her meal for having been inconvenienced.

my manager, being the awesome guy that he is, says that the lady answering the phones is only the cook, does not know how to cash out customers, and normally doesn't even answer the phones.

c rounds on him, saying that she was going to call corporate about this. without missing a beat, he says that the store is a franchise, and that as a franchise, all corporate complaints get redirected to the person at the store with the most authority (him), and that he would just delete it since he knows what kind of bull she likes to pull. he then tells her that for yelling at one of his employees, she was banned from the store, and to get the hell out before he made her get out. we haven't gotten an order from her since that day.",Sir_Autocorrect,tfys

disclaimer on formatting and all that good stuff. also, please understand that i'm not lazy, and i'm just trying to figure if what the owner is doing is legal. 

&amp;#x200b;

so recently we had this massive(?) chain restaurant open up. there restaurant alone has up to 30-40 employees (f/boh and host/ess). needless to say, they take up a lot of the parking down where it's a free public lot. so at my restaurant the owner typed a contract sheet and made all employees sign stating that we are forbidden to park in the lot, because it takes up our clients parking leading them to miss their reso times. in the contract it states that by signing we acknowledge that after being caught, we will face disciplinary action e.g. paying to get the boot off our car or/and getting fired. we also had to state our cars make, year, color and license plate. 

&amp;#x200b;

the owner has given us a map of the park and where we can all park... the location of the parking is roughly 3-4 blocks away from our spot- not a big problem since the weathers been getting nicer each day. 

&amp;#x200b;

i'm just curious, is he, the owner, legally allowed to prohibit his employees from parking at a public lot for the sake of his customers? fyi i honestly don't even know my license plate, so when i wrote my license plate number, i accidentally gave him the wrong one lol.

714,a post about my shitty (literal shit) night,"sooo last night i show up to work at 4 (tgichilibees type place)  where i was greeted with a sign on the door saying ""were closed for the next hour and half"". confused, i walk in and my host laughed and told me to go look in the back. i walk in the back and am met with a flood of raw sewage coming out ot every single drain. the entire boh (except the line) was completely flooded with sewage. we apparently had just closed down maybe 30 minutes before i got in and pretty much only closed because guests were coming in the back taking pictures. so when i got in at 4 there was still about 15 tables left in the restaurant oblivious to the sewage issue a few feet away and just waiting for their food. all of us who came in at 4 werent allowed to clock in but also werent allowed to leave. they kept us hostage for an hour and a half waiting on the plumber (but dont worry they bought pizza....). so the plumber comes and basically looks for 10 minutes and was like ok its fixed. so the drains in the boh stop pouring out with sewage and at this point both bathrooms that were completely flooded with water stopped flooding. as soon as the plumber said ok its fixed, the gm opened the restaurant. so no cleaning happened. they did take the hose and spray it down but no one sanitized or anything!! as soon as we opened the entire restaurant filled up so the kitchen got slammed.  ill spare the details but it was a dumpster fire. fast forward to 9 oclock (we dont close until 11). and guess what starts coming out of the drains in the boh again.... you guessed it sewage. we still had a full restaurant at this point but it was even worse than earlier so we locked the doors and didnt let any new guest come in. with a full restaurant though, we all still had like 4 tables that were there. so we all had to literally walk through raw sewing to serve our tables food that was made just a few feet around sewage. im talking like an inch of sewage in the server alley and at least 3 inches in and around the dish tank. there was literal toilet paper floating in the server alley and dish tank. 

&amp;#x200b;

honestly the more i think about it the more angry i get for them forcing us to work in shit. they should have never re opened last night and should have gotten a cleaning crew in there to scrub and sani everything. im repulsed and angry for myself but also for the people that got served food that was inches away from sewage and being served by servers who just walked from said sewage themselves.

(meaning i have the owner watching my back.) as a matter of fact,  he was the one hosting and witnessed the whole thing. also, as i've said many times in here,  i'm translating the best i can from french..  so sorry in advance for grammatical or syntax errors.

so..  getting to the story..

get to that table of old timers..  2 couples.  regular saturday ppl,  you know,   they don't get out often and they feel entitled because they're actually going out to spend monayyy!!!!

i go through the usual routine: bring water, going through my specials, explaining the dishes and the like..  (the ladies are loving it, asking questions and responding really well).  final words:  take some time to look at the menu,  i'll be back in a few minutes.

then i make a 180 degrees to my other table.  they have their menus setted and are ready to order.  i interract with them for about 20 seconds when i hear shouting behind me... (again, translating the best i can)

\-""servant???  servant?????""  (maybe 'slave' would be a better translation)

i ignore them and keep taking care of my current table, even tho i can feel they're really not comfortable with the other patrons trying to get my attention.

then i ignore the 1st table and go back to the bar to get drinks for my other tables.  i bring back said drinks all around (i have about 6 running tables at this moment) all the while one of the old timers keeps screaming 'servant?!?!?' at me and i shit you not,  half the restaurant is getting pissy as fuck at that guy,  while he,  oblivious as hell acts as he's the one being wronged.. (while the other 3 ppl at his table show obvious signs of shame) keeps screaming at me..  servant?!?!?   servant!?!?!?

&amp;#x200b;

and there i snap....  3 tables away from that dude without even looking at him... i scream to the top of my lungs for all to hear....  

&amp;#x200b;

what?!?!??!

&amp;#x200b;

i can see from the corner of my eye that my regulars are laughing in their sleves...half the of other customers are just looking at that asshole with disdain and scorn,  and when i turn around...  the other couple at his table are getting up and moving towards the coatroom just to get the hell out of there....

she was very understanding, so with her help i find my way to the houses around her number. after 5 more minutes of driving around i found houses 20, 22, and 24–she lives in 23 (which i later found out was literally a full two minute drive from the location i was at). 

at this point the woman calls again with a close to screaming voice and a much different attitude than before. we realize how lost i am, so i ask for a landmark. there is only one playground in the development (which is near her house) so with no other instruction she told me to meet her there and hung up, after i had already explained this predicament i am in.

after knocking on house 22 and having someone give me (very poor) directions to the nearest playground i manage to find my way. 

i stand outside for close to 5 minutes with my car idling and snow coming down. the woman calls me, makes a couple of sassy remarks about her cold food, and hangs up on me.

i get in my car and see that my gas light is on and i would not have enough to get home, and now realize that in my rush i left my wallet at my restaurant.

it took about another twenty minutes until my boss called her own phone to see what happened, and helped me get home.

moral of the story: don’t forget the rice!

717,ever just want to take your foot and shove it in your mouth?,"story time!

so i work in a pub.

i had a couple come in for dinner tonight.

he ordered a fish and chips, she ordered the beef dip sandwich.

their food comes.

i go to check and see how it's tasting, just as she's taken the sandwich in her right hand and taken a bite.

i make a joke ""what a classic waitress maneuver! i waited until your mouth was full of food to ask you how it was.  you don't have to answer, you can just give a thumbs up if you prefer.""

&amp;#x200b;

the man says his is great.

&amp;#x200b;

the woman finishes her bite of her sandwich, puts her sandwich back down with her right hand and says ""it's good, thank you.""

&amp;#x200b;

at this point i look down and notice she has no fingers on her left hand.

&amp;#x200b;

i asked this woman with no fingers to give me a thumbs up.

&amp;#x200b;

i pretended like nothing wrong had happened.

i pretended i didn't even notice she had no fingers on that hand.

718,"“is this a super special and different tgichilibees?”, and other quotes from “i need to speak to your manager before the night is through” lady.","wow guys...this table i had tonight pretty much did my head in. i have been a server for three years, and i have come across pretty much every type unsavory and unfavorable customer...but this lady took the heavily discounted cake! 

i was a closer at my local tgichilibees tonight, and wasn’t expecting much of a turnout due to the snowstorm we are experiencing currently. we had a pop at around seven, and then it died...if it weren’t for the lovely muzak and sub zero temperature, you would have heard crickets chirping. at around 9 p.m as i was diligently rushing to complete my sidework before close, a six top walked in. i was excited, as i saw dollar signs floating above their heads. an opportunity to make money! i had no idea what i was in for. 

the table consisted of a mother with an air of “can i speak to your manager” about her, her four children, and her friend. i will call “can i speak to your manager lady” bf from here on out, for bitch face). it was one of those tables from which you immediately sense that shit is just not going to go well. acting entitled, while loudly boasting “order anything you like! anything!” 

the first thing she did was tell me that she wanted to order two deserts at a discounted price. at the restaurant i work at, we offer a smaller version of our most popular dessert. in order to not give away the restaurant, i will call it a “mini-melt”. you see, mini melts usually cost just about 6 bucks. but if you order a kids meal, you can add on a mini-melt for $2.50. while i’m getting their drink order, bf tells me she would like to order two mini-melts for her kids to share. 

me: two mini-melts? you got it. will you guys be ordering some kids meals? 

bf: no, we never do, and i come to tgichilibees all the time and it’s never a problem. is that okay, or is this tgichilibees just super special and different? 

me: no mam, it’s okay. i just needed to know how to ring it in. 

bf: (with snark) oh, well i’m sorry to be an inconvenience. 

i will say that usually, we would have to charge her full price for the desserts as she didn’t order any kids meals. but since she was already just dripping with rudeness and attitude and i sensed a confrontation i didn’t want to have, i just let it go and rang them in under the discounted price. no big deal. 

as i walked away, one of their kids started yelling “wait! ummm...wait!!! i need a refill now”. usually when kids are rude like this, their parents correct them or at least give me an apologetic look. not these guys. 

when it came time to take their order, they were super fucking complicated. modifying everything. but out of the goodness of my heart and because i love my job and am good at it, i actually pointed out a way that they could order the same things they were ordering under a meal deal which would reduce the price and include an appetizer. bf ordered fajitas, but asked me to 86 two of the ingredients. 

i ran to ring their order in, being very careful to get all of their modifications right because i didn’t want to deal with the wrath of bf, lest everything not be perfect. unfortunately, it was about an hour to close, and the kitchen just wasn’t on their best game. her fajitas ended up being sent out with both of the ingredients she wanted 86d on them. (both minor things, no allergens). i want my customers to get what they ordered. i want them to have a good experience. i will bend over backwards to fix anything, replace anything, refire anything, because i love my customers and i want them to be happy. but there was no pleasing bf. 

me: hows everything looking guys? is there anything else that i can grab for you right now? 

bf: um, there’s cilantro and butter on my fajitas. did you miss the memo on me asking you for no cilantro and butter, orrrrr, what? did you just not care to do your job? 

me: i’m so sorry mam. i promise i rang it in absolutely correctly. would you like us to remake these for you? 

bf: no! we are trying to get out of here, so we will just have to deal with it. but before the night is through, i need to see your manager

me: absolutely. i will grab her right now. in the meanwhile, is there anything i can do to fix this for you?  (she said no)

after this, my (wonderful) gm went over to speak to her. i heard her bitching out my gm, and saw my gm wave her hands and say “what can i do, right now, to make this better for you”.

even though i felt very awkward, i went to check on them shortly thereafter. 

me: is there anything else i can do for you at the moment? 

bf: you can get a new manager. she is terrible. you are great, you have been awesome. but your manager is terrible. she didn’t even offer to pay for our food. before i leave, i want your managers superiors number in my hand. 

me: of course mam. i will absolutely get that for you. 

long story short, my manager did comp part of their meal (their check went from $100 to $80-ish). while they were bitching about her incompetence, she was actually back in the office grabbing them $25 worth of gift cards. 

but it didn’t end there. at the restaurant i work at, you can use a ziosk to pay at the table with a card. because my manager had altered their bill, their check was not showing up on the ziosk. 

bf: um excuse me? my check isn’t showing up. 

me: i’m sorry. sometimes if we comp or alter checks, they need to be processed manually. i can print you a check and take your card right now. 

bf: no! i want to pay here so i can take the survey. you’re lucky that all of the adults at this table have waited tables before. 

she made me get my manager again, and we had to re-ring everything so that her check could be paid via ziosk. i can’t wait to read the comment she wrote. 

anyway, she ended up still tipping me well. over 20%, and i’m happy that she realized it wasn’t my fault. i’m happy that i was able to give good service. but i will tell you, i’m not a cryer, and i wanted to cry. this whole thing was so unpleasant, made even worse by my desire to just make it better. if she had truly waited tables before, shouldn’t she understand that mistakes happen? i did feel bad for her, because her meal came out wrong even though i rang it in properly. i understand that’s frustrating. but she was just rude, entitled, demanding, and asking for a manager at every turn! none of these things would have been all that egregious, had they been said with less attitude. but the whole shebang, at the end of my shift, right before close, was just too much man! from the get go, she was temperamental and i just felt personally attacked by her. i felt like she was just itching to bite my head off. and i didn’t enjoy it. i also didn’t appreciate her trash talking my gm to me. i’m one of those lucky people who works under incredible management, and it annoyed me that she was trying to initiate me to trash talk my manager.

719,ten years in the industry and tonight is the first time i cried.,"first time poster, long time lurker. 
i have served for a while and being that i started at a 24 hour joint i thought i could handle anything. for the most part i can. but we all have our bad days. on this particular night my restaurant had a few large party reservations and then a sea of people walking in. we are not a large place and our kitchen matches it. shift starts a little busy then i get a 30 top all to myself. okay, no big deal, i’ve done this before. the first thing the table asked was if there were going to be people to help me. i said sure but we are all very busy. “i will do my best” i said. 

you know when you are busy and time, like the actual minutes, just accelerates? well some time had passed and i had noticed that it was time for their food. i go check. perfect timing me! it had taken a while and we were busy...and it’s a thirty top so that takes time. i start taking things out. about 8-9 dishes are sent out. and then.... one. at. a. time. and what seems like an eternity between each dish i take out, the group becomes more tense wondering why it’s taking so long. i start getting anxious but there is nothing i can do. just take food as it comes out. 

then food started to get sent back because it was cold. ugh! okay. you can tell we (me,kitchen,and guests) are getting annoyed. then a few of them walk in and start yelling wondering what in the world is going on. understandable. 
did i mention there were 11 separate checks? 
so one of the guests say that something better be taken off all their bills. now i’m thinking i’m about to get horrible tips. yay me.

finally all the food came out and they all cheered when it hit the table. 
when i apologized, every single person was so sweet and encouraging and said nice things like “keep your head up girl, you were fantastic” or the rare “we know it’s not your fault”
i mean it was just a shit storm so i’m not blaming anyone here. then after comping 90% of the tickets, they all made sure i was tipped well. 
guys. this is were i started crying. their kindness touched my heart so much i had to go in the back and cry for a minute. 

we hugged as they left. i shook all of their hands.

720,monopoly meltdown,"a little background info: i work at a pretty busy taphouse, but the environment is pretty chill and child friendly. 

today i had a table come in around 4, two parents and a 8/9 year old. i’ve served them a few times before and the parents are always relatively nice. their kid is kind of a pain in the ass. he’ll get into small hissy fits, push his plate away, tell me he “doesn’t like this place” most of the time that they come in. the parents always just ignore him. 

whatever, no skin off my back. my younger brother is autistic and i get the struggle of trying to dine out with a temperamental/ sensory sensitive child. i do what i can to cheer him up. 

today was a little different though. they came in, ordered a few drinks and appetizers, and broke out a game of monopoly. 

throughout the next hour or so, their son would scream, bawl, and try to push the board game off of the table whenever he felt like he was losing. it’s a relatively small restaurant and every table within earshot looked visibly annoyed. 

the mom ended up winning the game and the kid goes into full hysterics about how his mom didn’t deserve to win and she always takes things from him and what not. 

they continued to sit there, finishing their drinks and doing the “shush” single. 

i’m not going to make any judgements if the child has behavioral problems or not, but those parents are straight up assholes for 1. letting him scream, push things over, cry and 2. ignoring him and continuing to drink beer.

everyone around them, including my coworkers were pretty annoyed but i can’t help but feel bad for the little guy. those parents need a swift kick in the ass regardless. ",elanma,tfys
721,a busy friday in service + an active shooter..,"
update: i found out that the guy shooting fired 15 shots into a dance studio full of kids!! kids! i know if he turned around and saw me i would be dead. no question. i'm glad i reacted the way i did and kept people from going outside. 


i'm still trying to process last night so this won't be the most eloquent post. but fuck it, i almost got shot.

&amp;#x200b;

during a lull in service i decided to run out back to take a quick break. the backdoor of our restaurant functions as the front door of the speakeasy attached to the main dining room, this is usually where we all go out to take our breaks. i had my head down on my phone responding to a text and i walked out the back door.

&amp;#x200b;

boom.

dumpster lid? i thought.

boom. flash.

we don't have a dumpster.

i see the shooter a few feet from me, aiming toward a busy street full of store fronts and pedestrians.

boom. i see the muzzle flares.

he gets off eight shots while backing toward the door to the restaurant, the door of the back bar, toward the wall that twenty or so people are sitting directly behind. i finally get myself to move but i'm sure only a few seconds even went by.

&amp;#x200b;

i ran into the back bar and screamed for everyone to get down and come away from the walls because there's a shooter in the lot behind us. some people react, some just stare. i screamed at them again to get down and stay low and to move to the center of the restaurant. i scream to the bartender to lock the fucking door.

there are only two ways out of the lot where the shooter was, and that is around the building from either alley exit and to the front entrance of our spot. i'm sure instinct and fear took over but i wanted to make sure no one out front was in the line of fire so i sprinted up to the front door yelling for everyone at the windows to get down and move in to the center of the restaurant because there's a shooting happening outside. i ushered guests back in from the street who had just left and  explained what was happening and locked the fucking door. someone killed the lights to the dining room as guests made their way in to the interior of the building. i managed to get back to the back door as they were locking it and people were screaming for someone to call 911.

no one, and i mean no one had called 911 during this entire ordeal. i ended up calling them after collapsing into a sobbing mess in a supply area. a guest held my hand while i spoke with dispatch, another guest brought me a glass of water. i heard people offering hugs and thanks and naturally lots of questions. once we all knew the police were on their way my boss ushered me to the back office to calm down.

the police were there within two minutes interviewing me about what i saw. it turns out only one other person saw anything and it was from the window of their apartment inside the building being shot up. the officer in charge informed me that they were going to rope off our lot and to not go out back because the area was full of bullet casings they needed to get. it took me at least half an hour to calm down and process what the actual fuck had just happened. by the time i was able to go on to the floor to check on things, most tables were back in their seats finishing their meals.

i went to check on my tables to make sure they were ok. one of the guests at my table had been in the back bar during the entire ordeal, she told me that had it been her she would have nope'd the hell out of there and not done a thing to get people under control. if anyone on this sub who was there reads this i just want you to know that i am so sorry you had to go through this with me, with us. i did in the moment what my gut told me to do and that was to get all of you safe. thank you for the hugs and the support and i hope to serve you again sometime soon.

&amp;#x200b;

hopefully just tapas next time.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: walked out back for a break right into an active shooting. dude was several feet away with his back to me and he was backing toward the entrance to our restaurant. had to lock the place down. 1 star on google, wouldn't recommend. one star for not dying.

723,church lady goes crazy over bagels,"for the record, this isn't my story, it's my girlfriend's. she was working drive thru at panera tonight.

&amp;#x200b;

this lady comes through the drive thru during a rush, and she’s like “i need some bagels”, so my coworker dom is like ""alright what bagels?"" she’s like “hmmmmm i'm not sure, maybe 6 bagels? actually, 12. no, 26 bagels!”  she then proceeds takes 10 god damn minutes to pick out all her bagels because she doesn’t know what we have because  she was in the damn drive through, but she finally picks out all 26 bagels and she’s like “i want them sliced and toasted.”

the thing is, toasting a bagel takes like a minute per bagel and at this point we have a line that goes into the parking lot so we’re like ""are you sure you want 26 toasted bagels?"" and shes like yea i’m taking them to church.""

and so we’re like ""um do you want them to go bad? because toasted bagels do not keep."" so she said we didn’t have to toast them, and we sliced them all by hand and put them in this fancy ass bag. we bring it to her and she's like “i want them in buckets.” 

and we’re like, ""sorry what? buckets?""  she's like “the cardboard buckets.” but we’re out, so we told her, and she just yells “well then how am i supposed to take them into church?!?!?”  we’re like man idk, we gave you a fancy bag?!? so then she’s like “if you don’t have buckets, then i want them all individually bagged.” 

now i'm not sure if you’ve ever seen 26 bagels, but that’s a hell of a lot of bagels. and the line is even longer at this point. so we’re like no, we are not doing that, we can give you the bags and you can bag them, but we can’t. this is the point of the story where she gets her ass out of her car and she stands in the drive through window yelling at us!

so enrico and dom and kyle, my coworkers, and i are all there freaking out because she’s yelling at us and got out of her car. she's absolutely refusing to leave, and then micheal, our general manager, came and he was like “lady you gotta go, we gave you your bagels, you have to leave.” so naturally, she starts yelling at him. 

and the whole time her son is in the car next to her with his face in his hands, totally embarrassed by his crazy mother. she finally just got her ass back in the car with her bagels and left, but it was wild. ",nudguy,tfys

725,"how much to tip my busser? or alternatively, am i just being stingy with my tips?","(this is a very long post) before my question, i must give some context about our establishment. 

so, i am a server at small-ish restaurant. we're not a chain. we have 13 employees, and 7 out of the 13 are servers. however, most of the servers are part-timers, working about 5 to 10 hours a week. furthermore, we're not a high end place, the prices of our meals fall within the 10-15 dollar range with an exception of one particular entree that is priced at 20. we have a total of about 21 tables which allows for the possibility to sit 75-80 people (not including vs including the bar area). for us have that many means it's a full house, and at minimum and maximum there are 2 and 3 servers on the floor, respectively. i know there are multiple places where servers don't have much responsibilities, but at our place we have a lot of duties. on top of regular server work we wash rice (we wash about a total of 25 to 30 cups of rice a day) , regular cleaning maintenance of our area of the kitchen, dining, and restroom area,, prep for lunch and dinner rush, certain closing activities, etc. a server working lunch is expected to arrive at 10:30, half an hour before opening to do prep work and their shift ends at 4:30. those working dinner must arrive at 4:30 and shift ends at 10 or 10:30 depending on if it's a weekday or a weekend night. given that, a server working a full day workers 10:30 to 10 or 10:30 with a 30 minute break. so it's an 11 or 11.5 hour work day. it's also common for certain waitresses to work back to back full days. as for our pay, it's below minimum around 7.5 dollars an hour and are tips are shared among the waitresses working that day. 

now given all of that, we have a certain busser who during lunch washes dishes and clears tables. he's given two positions, so during lunch it's not possible for him to clean all the tables. our boss states that, for busy days, we should give 10%, but on the slower days we can give 7%. this is 7-10% of our total tips. 
so, most of the servers feel like it's unfair to give him 7 to 10% of our tips when he has only cleared a few tables during lunch. but, there are no complications during dinner because we have another dishwasher that only works evenings, so his position during dinner shift is strictly busser. he also vaccums the place at night (a duty that was once a waitress' closing activity on top of cleaning the kitchen, bathroom, and sometimes closing the register). recently, there was a confrontation where he went to one of our senior waitresses and demanded that he wasn't payed enough for the work he did on a saturday. it was a busy day, full house during lunch and we were short a hostess, and full house during dinner. i can admit that we didn't give him enough which is our mistake. 10% of our tips would have yielded him 55 dollars and we only gave 40. that i can 100% admit for being stingy. however, there was another incident where it was just me during a lunch shift. it was busy for 1 person, but if there was two servers it would be considered slow. and so, i did most of the bussing that day since customers came and left in small groups. since i did the work, at the end of the night i didn't think it was necessary to tip him during lunch. and the same thing happened again a few days later. i did the work, so i didn't give him a cut. then he proceeded to confront me at night in an angry manner, lecturing me about how he does a lot of work and works hard too. he proceeded to bring my parents into it using it to power over me. i was extremely upset that night because of it and since i didn't want to confront it at that time because earlier that day my boss heard of the first incident and told me to tip the busser to show that we appreciated his help. so, i bit my tongue and gave him 15 dollars from my wallet.

now, given all this, how much should we tip our busser? there are no problems when it is busy. but when it's not and he only does a few tables what is the fair amount? i do appreciate that he helps us clean the tables when it's busy. i know he works hard, but we work hard as well. and i've done some research that some places tip their busser 15 to 20% or alternatively 1% of total sales. but, is it fair for him to demand a percentage of tips when he had only cleared a few tables? is his entitlement justified or are we just being stingy? if we gave him 55 dollars that time for a day's work, is that a standard/normal amount bussers receive in tips?",nogreenbeans,tfys

now, i had five girls sitting at a table diagonal from them still in my section celebrating one's 14th birthday. could never fault them. all pleases and thank yous and we're such a delight to serve and honestly made me laugh, told them they were all my sisters age and how one looks like my cousin, just the loveliest table of had the whole night.
it comes to around the end of both table's meals when i bring out a brownie with a candle in it to sing happy birthday, making a whole sign and dance about the girls special day just to make her feel even more special and the way their faces lit up giggling when they saw was honestly adorable and how they were fussing over the embarrassed birthday girl. straight after i got their spoons i cleared a table beside the other three girls who then asked if they could pay their bill, to which i replied ""just be a second girls, be right with you!""

...

i walk out the kitchen, and they made a run for it. i didn't even see them leave they were that fast. i checked the bar, the table, the floor, anything to try and avoid leaving this tab unpaid but unfortunately they left nothing. i'll be the first to admit i panicked a little bit as when this happened to other servers previously they had to pay (which i've come to realise is super illegal so don't worry). the table of five girls clearly knew something was up though, although i didn't say anything and tried to avoid looking worried so as to not make other guests uncomfortable during their stay. these girls... my god they were lovely. asked to pay their bill and when i told them their parents had already paid they were so thankful, then handed me all the change they had on them ""for the good service"".

i went behind the bar and just cried. like, it's not even about the money it's the difference in attitude from these girls and how polite they were. it was my second server shift since i'd come back from sick leave (for three months, which again they obviously never knew about) and as they were leaving all of them waved and thanked me, told me i was doing great, ""thanks for making my birthday even better!"" it properly touched me.

tldr: table of three young girls dined and dashed, table of five young girls were the nicest table i've ever had, probably caught up on my panicking and tipped me all the change they had on them, conclusion = the hope for younger generations isn't lost (meaning when they thanked me for the service, not the money) ",1919am,tfys
731,wife catches her man on tinder,"someone else posted about a girl cheating and her man finding out, and it reminded me of something that happened a few months ago. 

it was later in my dinner shift and i only had this couple sitting and waiting for their food. my restaurant is relaxed, there was nothing to do at the moment so i was mindlessly scrolling reddit when i hear the wife in this situation getting a little firm while she spoke to her husband. mind you, she was incredibly calm. just a firm, yet quiet tone. let’s be honest, what server wouldn’t eavesdrop on some drama on a slow night? i couldn’t hear most of their conversation but i could hear the man getting a little flustered. i looked up from my phone wondering if maybe i should break the tension and offer more bread, put down napkins, something- (there had been at least two other loud arguments between couples before since i had started working here two years ago, so i didn’t want it to escalate, god forbid kids walked in or something)

y’all. 

she held his phone, right up in front of him. it was unmistakable, the profile picture of a woman on a dating site. plastered there. “woman’s name, age, miles away”. 

in the calmest voice i think i’d ever heard in such a tense moment (i wonder if anyone ever heard from this man again) she spoke, “go ahead. swipe right.” his face, plastered with shock, was frozen. he was frozen. 

there was a lot of silence. i was stunned. in that moment, like the heavens above sending down a blessing of protection, the bell rang for their food and i hurried back to grab it and serve it, make the interaction fast. 

i wish i had a good ending for you all. but that experience has stuck with me.  the things you overhear in a restaurant, ha.

i’m a busser at a sushi restaurant. the other night, it was slowing down and several tables had all gotten up around the same time. there were five tables that needed to be bussed so i just started working my way through it. i had been working for about five minutes when another table gets up and leaves. a few seconds later the tables waitress comes up to me and tells me to bus a3. i say i’ll do it when i’m done with these and then continue to work on the one i’m doing. so i’m still working on the other tables and she comes back up and like takes the rag out of my hand and tells me to bus a3 first.

734,impatient customers...,"hello, i'm new to this sub, i hope food runners are allowed...

&amp;#x200b;

so this happened about half a year ago when i first started working at the restaurant i currently work at, my job is pretty easy, i take care of some small things in the kitchen (polishing silverware and side plates, making sure condiments are ready for dishes, etc.) and of course, running food to tables. on this particular day, it wasn't too busy but it wasn't dead either, there was an order ready of several happy hour appetizers for a table, they had essentially gotten two of each, nothing out of the ordinary.

our happy hour apps are served on smaller plates/small ceramic bowls that can be difficult to balance more than one of in my hands/arms so i decided to use a tray and was able to get pretty much everything on the tray and carried the rest in my hand (this is important). now, these ceramic bowls that are used retain heat for a pretty long time, this is important because one of our apps, the mini mac n cheese, is put into a broiler in the ceramic bowl that it is served in (so that the cheese on top gets nice and crispy it tastes amazing honestly) which obviously means that these little bowls are pants-shittingly hot when they're fresh out of the broiler.

anyway, when i get to the table for the order i see it's a family, mom, dad and their kid (maybe 6 or 7 y/o), they just so happened to playing uno while they waited for their food and had cards all over the table, no big deal, they're having a good time. as soon as i arrive carrying all their food the dad apologizes and him and the kid begin to clear space for me to set their food down, i just smile and say it's no big deal, after a few seconds of moving piles of cards around there was enough space for me to set their food down, the dad was half paying attention to me, half paying attention to this apparently extremely intense game of uno since the mom hadn't even noticed i was there, she had been laser focused on the game the whole time this was going down. 

as soon as i start setting down their food on the table the mom realizes what is happening, and as though to make sure i could get out of her way as soon as possible so she could continue this game of uno she decides i'm not placing food down fast enough (which they had ordered a lot of) and glances over to me quickly (but immediately returning her attention to the game) reaches to grab stuff off my tray (while not looking at what she's reaching for), as she does this i'm already setting something else down on their table so i wasn't really able to stop her. remember how i said the mac n cheese bowls are extremely hot? well, guess what she grabs? yep, the mac n cheese, completely ignoring the small wooden board below the bowl meant for people not to burn themselves, she simply grabs the bowl like a crane claw, (mind you, she's still trying to play uno this whole time), these next 3 seconds happened in slow motion for me, as i see the mom's facial expression change from intense focus to sheer pain as she lets out a short yelp and drops the bowl of mac n cheese all over her cards.

she then looks at me with a look of disbelief as if i had just stabbed her in the back with a steak knife, i was trying really hard not to laugh and said ""i'm sorry, but you really shouldn't be grabbing stuff off my tray."" she was still in shock and i apologized again, this time talking to the dad since he seemed to be better at communicating, and said i would ask the kitchen to make another mac n cheese for them. he said it was fine and laughed it off, the mom still seemed annoyed though...

739,the spoon guy,"hello from the restaurant with the rocking chairs out front! i have a story that happened about a week ago.  

i was at a table right next to the host stand.  a man rushed passed the host and in to the dining room, and asks a new server for a spoon.  i think nothing of it, she'll grab a to go spoon for this man. i continue with my table until the host rushes up to me.

""the server gave him a real spoon, and he took off to the bathroom.""

excuse me, what!?

i hesitate in the dining room. the manager on duty never wears her earpiece, so i can't call for her on the headset.  we are not allowed to confront people, so for a brief second, i was lost on what to do.

i had two tables at the time, a 4 top and a 1 top, all men, and they were next to each other. the 1 top stops me.

""hey, you know that's a drug addict right?""

""yeah, i know. but i can't get ahold of my manager and we are not allowed to do anything."" 

""do you want me do do something about it?  i'd be more than happy to.""

he stands up and walks quickly to the bathroom. he's in there for what seems like an eternity to me, while two men from my 4 top get up to see what's going on. they all come out, my 1 top has the spoon. the man goes to start yelling at the poor girl up front, screaming about racism and harrassment and discrimination, (all parties involved are white) and hes an ex cop and wants to speak to the manager, threatening to call the cops. 

the manager finally comes out, they exchanged words and he left. the best part was, he told her he found the spoon in the bathroom. 

i'll never know what exactly when down in the men's room, but the man we've dubbed ""the spoon guy"" is now our new ""regular."" and by that, i mean a new regular person who sits outside asking for money or food and coming in every night 5 minutes before close to ask for water. and he doesn't remember any of us.

he came in last night, twice, same host, same manager and same me from the day he took the spoon to the bathroom, and didn't recognize any of us and was super polite to the manager who's face he was nearly spitting in a week ago.

740,rice in the carpet (and other annoying stuff to clean),"dear other servers, 

if you have never had to sweep up rice off a carpet, consider yourself lucky. someone dropped a bowl of rice on the floor, was given another bowl, and spilled about half. sweeping up rice with a really shitty broom and a dustpan is near impossible. you ever read the phantom tollbooth where the protagonist is given ridiculous tasks like emptying a well into another well with an eye dropper? i lived through that. pretty much was able to get a max of 5 grains of rice at a time out of the carpet into the dustpan. was not fun. similar struggle occured when a parent would bring in some kind of baby cereal for the, well, baby and it would all be dropped on the floor and then stepped on to break into tiny pieces that were sucked into the carpet.

===

wax. annoying other stuff to clean up. we had crayons at the tables for the little ones to color. kids would break the crayons in half and people would put garbage in the cups because they were assholes (the buskids were supposed to clean them and replace any crappy crayons at the end of the night but rarely did it unless you hounded them). we had candles at the table as people thought it would be hilarious to melt the crayons in the fire and then rub the wax all over the table and stick the crayons on the table so they dried that way. ahahaha so funny lel 

wax is not super easy to get off a table and we would have to clean the candles as well afterwards. this happened one too many times for me.

===

sesame seeds. our most popular item was burgers and we served them on a sesame bun. the seeds would get everywhere, all over the table and on the seats. i would eat a burger frequently after work and even being careful i would spread my seed. i don't know if these were magic sesame seeds but after wiping a table it seemed more would appear. wipe table again. still there. why seeds why?

=== 

glass. i had to deal with it a lot more as a busser. i guess whoever invented this idea had never taken a science class. we would take beer glasses out of the hot dishwasher and put them into the cold freezer to chill the class. now, i bet you have been in elementary school science. glass becomes really brittle when heated and cooled quickly, and the same glasses over and over...
 i had many a glass shatter into my hands. glass is also a pain to clean off the floor as 

1) we don't have glass-proof gloves 

2) glass is see through

3) glass likes to shatter into really tiny pieces when it is brittle

741,abusing the system to get free food and then skimp on a tip,"so i'm working at a steakhouse that is themed like the australian outback (maybe you can guess which one). this couple sits down and i take their order. he orders the steak and shrimp combo which is on a different part of the menu than the steak, so i know i didn't get it wrong (this will become important later). i bring him them their food and after a few minutes check to make sure everything is alright. he complains that he ordered sautéed mushrooms and not shrimp. i know, they sound so much alike. so i go back and tell my manager, who at the time was the owner, the mistake and get him his mushrooms.

i watch the table from the kitchen since they are my only table at the time and the guy doesn't touch his mushrooms for 10 minutes. i come back to check on them and he complains again saying the mushrooms aren't warm enough. you know, what happens when you let hot food sit for too long. i ask him if i can get him a new side and he complains saying ""no i don't even want them now, by the way my wife's steak is undercooked."" (update: forgot to add that her steak couldn't have been cooked more perfectly.) i look at her and she just shrugs confused, but doesn't say anything. so now i go back and tell the owner and he decides to comp half their check and offer a free dessert. i walk back and apologize, offering them the free dessert to which he orders two desserts and specifically asks whether or not they will both be free. so i go to the back again and the owner just gives it to them.

742,even gordon ramsey wouldn't dip in this mess,"this is my second post on this sub, but after today i've had it with my workplace and honestly it deserves it's own hell's kitchen arch with the way they treat their staff, customers, kitchen and food. i'm probably gonna post lots of stuff from my mere 5 months of working here, but for now i'm gonna keep it to just today. 

just a little bg, i work as a waitress at a small local, family-owned turkish restaurant/take-out/delivery restaurant in a small town. i'm the only non-turkish employee and i've just about had it with them. maybe i'll make a post just directed at the pure racism and sexism i'm shown by them, but it's not enough for a whole post imo. onto today

it started off calm, like usual. we open 3pm but usually only start filling in at 5pm. today's no different. what is different is today's carnival, so the restaurant was absolutely packed. my day was filled with serving the tables and picking up phone-calls. today's series of pure awfulness start with a phonecall from an angry customer, who says her take-out is cold. i kindly tell her i didn't work on it and ask to hand her over to someone who did. after nearly being shouted at for not doing it soon enough, i hand her to the boss. he tells her to come back (small town, little walk etc) and if it is he'll make a new order for her.

about 10 minutes later she shows up, easing my anxiety for the next few phonecalls not being her at least. he takes the bag with the unopened meals, walks to the other employees, comes back to her and in the rudest tone possible:

""i have no idea what's wrong with it but i'll make you a new one anyways.""

a bit taken back by the rude response, the customer starts arguing that it's cold, to which he responds it's not. meanwhile i'm helping a couple at the counter, 3 people behind them. we all just kinda zoned out and watched, because the owner was literally having a loud argument with a customer over whether or not the food was hot. she demanded her money back, he nearly threw it at her and threw the order away.

luckily the people i was helping collectively decided it didn't happen and we went on, with some angry mutters of my colleagues directed at the customer. who was here with an honest complaint. but of course family sticks together??

the second occurance was mostly me one-sidedly deciding to not overprice a meal for a customer, because it's absurd how expensive shit is at this place and the only reason they get away with it is because there's literally nothing else in the area. 

now this guy was pretty nice over the phone, but one of his orders was a dish that usually comes with greens and without cheese, but he asked for greens (and trust me they throw a shit-ton of them in it) and cheese instead. now this wasn't any sort of special cheese, just normal grated cheese. so i put an extra 50cents on top of it cuss of the extra, company-policy. boss looked at the order, told me to put and extra euro instead of 50cents, because he had extra cheese. yeah, cheese, but no greens, which probably saves you a fuck ton of salad. 

so i sent it with the deliveryguy, delibarately taking off that 50 cents because i am not demanding an entire euro for a small handful of grated cheese when the guy saved us the same amount in greens.

number 3 disgusted me the most, but that was just because it's disgusting and even chuck-e-cheese does their best to deny these things. so an older couple came in and ordered a big grill dish, which comes with 2 extra breads. they hadn't used these breads when they left, so when i went to clean the table, the plate with the -mostly- clean breads was still as it was served. my boss looked at me walk by, stopped me, took the bread, and put it away for the next order. these breads had been cooked over 30 minutes ago and they were re-serving them. when the bread had already been cooked with the last order (aka meat stains cuss they go in the same pan for the same order). this one might be understandable to some degree to save money, but still, disgusting.

later on i was washing the pans used for the meat because i was told to, and reprimanded for washing them too well, because that was too much effort. i'm still trying to fathom the logic in this one, but basically they wanted me to remove meat crusts from the pan and then put the wet pans back. because that's definitely sanitary.

the last 2 happened after my shift. i'm free to eat whatever, which i gladly do after 4 hours of standing in the heat of the meat-spinners (never work in a turkish restaurant those things are insane). so i'm still there 30-60min after my shift in uniform eating in the front. i'm sitting at the table closest to the opening in the counter, which is basically the employee and trusted regulars table. they join me as i'm eating and i greet them, but continue to watch my show on my phone (hey, i'm eating what else can i do?). after about 10 minutes my boss rips the earphones from my ear (in general he's pretty rude when he wants something done, but he can be a great guy when he wants to do stuff for others) and starts talking about our shifts next week. along the way the topic of me moving to the city comes up (exam student here, definitely going to a uni in the city in july).

""yeah, like, you were gonna move in what, august? cuss august is really busy here so we'll need to know in advance so we can book you both (his daughter and me are the only waitresses sucks to be them).""

this kinda caught me off guard, because when i was hired i thought i was pretty clear about moving away in july, but what surprised me even more, was the fact that i had told my other boss (father and son, the son is usually in charge and the one who dealt with the customers and money) in january i was quiting in april to focus on my studies. january. and i calmly remind them of that. 

the daughter, pizzamaker and father were all sitting there surprised. my boss hadn't even told them i was quiting. that or he had literally forgotten. ????????????!!!!!!!!!

couple minutes after they leave me alone again, and the last customers at the table leave. a tad misogynistic, but the females (aka waitresses) aren't allowed to work after 8pm even though they go till 3am. not that i'm complaining about not having midnight shifts, but this is already after 8pm. aka i'm off the clock, not getting money. as they leave, they tap my shoulder, point at the dirty, now empty, table and tell me to clean it. over an hour after my shift ended. and complain when it isn't clean enough. i'm not even getting paid for this.

one was on a table of about 20 people, where they wanted a drinks round. cool, no problem. served everyone their drinks and then get called back over. this lady asked for elderflower gin and tonic but she got just normal. ok, no problem, accidents happen. i take it back over to the bar and try it. nope. it is elderflower gin and tonic, the gin just is not particularly flavourful. i make her another and return it and she says 'yeah, that's much better'. it's exactly the same as what i originally gave her. the power of psychology.

another table was being looked after by my colleague but when she was on her break i took over. the two ladies asked for gin and tonic, and tanqueray gin at that. no problem. i go to the bar, put the measures in and the lady comes to me. they're drinking a specific flavour of this gin that they hadn't specified but act as if i'm the idiot as i didn't know - you said this so i pour this, not a different gin. i have to tip away and start over because they couldn't be slightly more specific. that's what they ordered but in their mind i knew what they were drinking. idiots.

yeah i know we have a party of 18 but we have been waiting longer than the people you just sat in a booth for 4 people.

yeah i know the wheelchair provided is to transport customers to a table and other people might need it but we don't want to move the person 2 feet to a chair so we will just use it as a chair.

yeah i know that room is closed and all the fucking lights are off inside but we want to sit there.

yeah i know it is 6pm on a saturday night and the place is packed but we want to sit somewhere quiet.

yeah i know this is a family resturant but we don't want to sit near kids even though almost every table has kids.

yeah i know people have been waiting longer than me but i want to sit now because *insert basic excuse* 

yeah i know we are an incomplete party and you told us 3 times you don't sit incomplete parties but we want to sit now. (we don't sit incomplete parties because 0 idea when the rest will show up and a lot of the time they show up way later and the table is locked down for an extremely long time)

yeah i know that table is dirty and hasn't been cleaned yet but we want to sit there because i want to stare at the busboy/busgirl and make them super uncomfortable while they bus and clean the table.

yeah i know this table is for parties of 6 or more but we want to sit here. (if you have someone in a disability scooter or it isn't busy, fine whatever. servers will give you shit for it but they have to suck it up. i've been yelled at for refusing to sit people at large tables because other parties were waiting for it and they apparently 2 people need enough space for 8 people for all the food they will get)

yeah i know you told us an hour wait and it has been 10 minutes, this is unacceptable let us sit now.

yeah i know you told me repeatedly that you can't give out private information but when does this waitress work, when does she leave work, what is her last name, and what is her phone number? come on be a bro. (please don't be creepy, this is the only time ever that i am aggressive towards a customer)

yeah i know you told me multiple times that you can't take my order because you don't know the menu or how to place my order but i am going to repeat my order to you so you can't get someone who can take my order.

why don't you have a private room? it is *insert some occasion* and we demand a private room. (k we don't have one what do you want me to do?)

i also had one lady try to sit down at a table with other people at it because she wanted to sit there. the people were understandably freaked out and i told her she could not sit there, and she ignored me. i had to get a manager while she just sat there.

i don't know why but we had equally sized boths on either side of this asile and people insisted that one side had smaller booths. because i would decieve them for some reason.

customer: that booth is smaller, let us sit on that side.

me: the booths are the same size. that server has been sat 3 times in a row already, you won't get as good service.

customer: let me speak to your manager.

bonus: we had an arcade machine in the lobby

customer: give me money for the machine.

me: no.

customer: let me speak to your manager.

customer: the machine is broken

me: we don't own the machine, the space is being rented by another company. sorry but we can't do anything but take a note.

748,first server job. finding myself overwhelmed.,"just started a new server job. currently have had restaurant and bar experience but never served especialy in a full service restaurant. this place has a very particular way of doing things but sometimes i mess up on little things like replacing silverware between apps and entrees or sometimes messing up on any off menu plates that they'd like us to sell. there is also no bussers and runners so we keep most of our tips but the sections are smaller.

i guess the main thing is getting overwhelmed and messing up details and the smaller things and it feels like everyone is noticing and paying attention. and when i screw these things up its messes with my confidence and then speaking to customers becomes a challenge so it just kinda snowballs.

any server know this feel and how to properly cope with it?",Lurker9605,tfys
749,birthday songs,"i feel like this is a popular opinion, but i just need to get this off my chest to people who understand. birthday songs are the worst!

i know most chain restaurants have their own wild traditions, and thankfully mine isn’t too bad (just a quick song with clapping), but still, it is so inconvenient and awkward. 

the worst is when it’s during peak hours. trying to round up as much people as possible when everyone else has their own shit to do is practically impossible, or having to stop what you’re doing to sing is incredibly annoying. 

also, when it’s just down to me and another server, trying to sing is so awkward. i think everyone can hear the pain in my voice. i usually just tell them that i don’t want to ruin their birthday with my voice, so i’m not going to sing.

the only time i like doing it is for tiny kids and some older people, but living in a university town, it’s usually to drunk, judgy teens/young adults. 

please validate my feelings towards this and share your horror stories!",x2016nlo,tfys
750,how i ruined a “dying woman’s” last christmas,"

a few years ago i was a restaurant supervisor for a large chain hotel. we would take reservations for the restaurant, but we usually weren’t extremely busy unless it was a holiday or wedding season. 

christmas eve is a busy night for us, and we give reservations a two hour window, but if there are other tables we can use we don’t typically enforce the time limit. we do not guarantee certain tables. ever. we will take notes if a guest has a request for a specific table but never ever guarantee it. 

30 minutes before their reservation, this seemingly pleasant woman comes up and inquired where her reservation for 5 people would be. i politely informed her that as of this time we are expecting it to be table x, a large round table, half booth, with 3 chairs on the outside. we typically let people know if they are getting one of these tables- some people love it, others refuse to be seated at a booth. she gave me two ring boxes and said they were for her daughters as a surprise and asked that we put them on the table before seating them. 

about ten minutes before their reservation it is clear that the table before them is not going to be up in time. however the restaurant had quieted so we moved their table to another one that was ready. the woman insisted that was unacceptable and they would wait for their table. i directed them to our bar area across the hall, got them settled and bought them appetizers and a round of drinks. (not necessary in normal world, but in the world of f&amp;b if you don’t give them something corporate will give them everything). 

twenty minutes go by and she is harassing me for her table. i politely inform her that the guests have lingered but showed her 4 other tables that could accommodate her family immediately. she demanded that we make that table leave. she started throwing a fit and the guests quietly started collecting their belongings and leaving the table. my servers, bussers, and i descended on the table and had it cleaned and reset within five minutes (complete with the stupid rings). i direct her family and her to this precious table. i think the storm has passed. i am wrong. 

the shrew follows me back up to the host stand and demands to know what i am going to do to compensate her for ruining christmas. i politely explained that i had already comped their appetizers and a round of drinks, but if it would make her happy i would also buy them a dessert. inches from my face she shrieks “that’s it?!?!” giving up, defeated- i reply “ma’am what would make you happy?” wrong thing to say. 

shrew: i shouldn’t have to tell you! you’re the manager, this is your fault! make me an offer! i am dying and this is my last christmas with my family and you have ruined it. 

(note the rest of her family was very delightful and polite and enjoying conversation and appetizers while she verbally assaulted me at the host stand)

she sat down, accepted free dessert and christmas still came. a couple of weeks later my general manager informed me that i had a complaint against me and asked for my side. i explained the alternative tables we offered in addition to the fact that we hadn’t guaranteed a specific table to her in the first place. i outlined all the free stuff i had comped and had statements from staff about how i had remained polite and professional to her in spite of her outburst. he sent her a personal letter of apology and a $100 gift card. i started looking for a new job as i had zero respect for him after that. 


she continues to come into the hotel years later, so idk if she was ever really dying. 

tl;dr- an entitled woman demanded a specific table, got angry when it wasn’t available, got loads of free stuff and was still a rabid harpy about it. 

i have so many stories of insane, rude, and entitled people from working there and i am so grateful my life has taken a different path and i work in an office setting now. ",Motleybird,tfys

""what do you mean this gift card has no money on it? horseshit. can you try again?"" 

even though i gave him the printed declined paper that literally said there's nothing on the card, i went to go try again just to reassure him and calm him down. 

same thing. same receipt. same reaction. 

he very annoyingly tosses me his debit card and leaves no tip on a $60 tab. i noticed his gift card was a bit scruffed up so he had it in his wallet for awhile. 

like bro, idk why the fuck you're getting mad at me when this is on your end. you probably used it all, the server for some reason brought the card back to you, and your dumbass just put it back in your wallet and completely forgot you used it.

753,i get called the f slur after serving a man exactly what he asked for,"
i originally posted this on r/maliciouscompliance but a few people said i should post this here, too

some background: i use to work at a family resturant in my small town as a waiter/cook when i was a teenager. i also dropped out of highschool after sophomore year but i got my hsed through a technical college. because i didnt go to school during the week days i'd often be scheduled to work then since the majority of our staff was highschool girls. 

i was the only male waiter working at this small family resturant and the only non highschool people who worked here was the owner and her son who usually cooked during the busy afternoons. 

most adults worked first shift in my town and kids were at school so it's super slow early in the day. this story takes place on a monday, and i was the only one at work other than my owner who was in a small back office doing whatever the hell she does.

i'm tending to a few elderly customers who have already been served their food when in walks a man and what i presume to be his son. i've never seen either of them before and this is a small town so i figure that they're just passing through and stopped to get some breakfast.

they take a seat at a table and i bring them their menus and ask them what to drink. the dad makes a comment about how hes never had a male waiter before and i just shrug it off because it wasnt the first time someone said this. 

i get they're drinks, bla bla bla, then wait till they are ready to order. the son orders a mexican omelet. easy. the dad orders the french toast. 

now, almost all french toast has some cinnamon in it, but ours has way more than usual. we even call it cinnamon french toast on our menu. the dad asks for double the cinnamon. 

i cant imagine that'll taste any good since cinnamon is a very strong tasting ingredient.

ad: asshole dad

me: sir i can add a little more cinnamon if youd like but the recipe already has a lot in it so double the cinnamon might taste a little overpowering

ad: i didnt order your opinion

me: but sir-

ad: i said double the cinnamon!

hes literally yelling at me so i stop trying to talk sense into him. the son looks embarrassed and i give them my friendliest smile and tell them that i'll be right out with his orders.

i go into the back and i poke my head in the owners door just to warn her that we are about to have a customer complaint. she heard the shouting and makes me fill her in. she then goes out to talk with the man herself and gets basically the same response.

i make the french toast with the insane amount of cinnamon and i serve that and the omelet before leaving to do a coffee round. 

one bite in and the dads already screaming at me. i come back to his table and ask him what's wrong in my most friendliest of voices. 

ad: you put way more than twice the cinnamon in this!! what the hell is wrong with you!

me: i assure you sir that is exactly what you ordered.

ad: do you think i'm stupid? i'll have you fired for this f*ggot!

i was actually rather speechless at this point because i never had someone scream that at me before. the son looked about ready to jump out the window and even the owner who had come out of her office when the screaming started looked shocked. 

i'm not feminine in any way. i don't have a girly voice but i do have longish bangs and hair so blond it's almost white. i'm bi and had a girlfriend at the time but i never cared about being called gay before. however i was already so frustrated at this point, plus all the screaming at me, i felt like i might cry. 

the dad then starts screaming about how hes not going to eat this shit and shoves the plate off the table like a child. the owner is livid at this point and tells him to pay and leave or else she will call the cops. 

he insists that hes not going to pay for anything and that hes gonna tell everyone not to eat here and drive us out of business before storming out. 

his son quickly pays for the meal and follows his dad, who is still screaming at the top of his lungs, outside.

i was livid, especially since both me and the owner tried to warn him, but i calmed down after i saw two generous $20 the son must of left me on their table.

sorry man if that was hush money. 

tldr; asshole demands double the cinnamon in his french toast and calls me a f*ggot when i give it to him. gets kicked out of the store and son tips me like a saint. ",GrumpsMcPickle,tfys
754,"singing ""happy birthday"" and an awkward story that happened","if the person is not 10 or under or older than 80, please do not ask us to sing. it is really weird to sing to a teenager or an adult. most of the time it is as a funny goof, but it is just really awkward. 

please also do not ask if it is extremely busy. 

please also if we sing, sing along. especially if there are less than 4 of us. i have a story of one of my cringiest moments as a waiter. let us begin.

if requested to sing happy birthday, we gotta do it. typically we have to drag a couple of other staff along to do it. my sweet elderly co-worker needed people to sing. all my tables had their food and were sitting pretty, so i said fine. it was extremely busy so we couldn't find anyone else. i wanted to wait but she insisted. it was a table of 10 and the person being sung to was probably about 40. 

we began to sing and no one else at the table did. just the two of us sang!  oh my god i swore it took 7 years to get through the song. she was pretty bad at singing and i was no pro. essentially we yelled the song at him. we have a couple of great singers on staff but they were all busy.

i have never been more embaressed in my life x-x",darealSquish,tfys
755,it's your job to make my life easier!!,"hi! first time posting so i hope this is the right place. 

for a little context: i work at a local green siren coffee shop. it's a busy morning and i'm on the register. a little bit to my left is our display case where we have our sandwiches and breads/pastries on display. there are little signs by each item explaining what everything is, but most people don't read the signs and instead just point to what they want. as i'm on the other side of the counter, i can't tell what the customer is pointing to unless they're directly in front of the case. this is what most people end up doing when i ask them to clarify which item they'd like. but not this guy.

c =  customer

me = surprise, it's me

the interaction starts off normal. i had just finished up with a customer who paid a $4 order with a $100 bill, thus clearing out most of my till. a bit irritating but whatever, i moved on. i started this new transaction with a smile and asked this guy what i could get for him. standard drink order, probably a latte or something, i don't remember honestly. then he pointed to the case.

c: i want one of those

i had no idea what he was pointing to. i asked him to tell me which item he wanted.

c: that white bread over there

white bread? we don't have any white bread?? he must be talking about one of the loaves. probably lemon loaf (yellow, not white), but i wanted to make sure.

me: could you tell me what kind of bread? the names are on the sign next to it

maybe i shouldn't have said this? i don't know, i just get tired of people assuming i can read their minds.

c: i don't know! it just says loaves!

now to be fair, from behind the counter, the sign for the loaves had all three flavors listed on the back, but the front actually did just say loaves. i didn't know this until later. (i'm still relatively new and there are some things i still don't know)

i moved from the register over to the case, closer to the loaf display at the very end. he doesn't follow me over, like most people usually do, just continues to point from where he's standing. he's starting to get irritated now.

c: that one right there!

i quickly move back to the register. i'm sure he wants the lemon loaf now, but since he obviously doesn't even know what it is, i decide to list each flavor for him. maybe i let this go on for too long, but he was being so vague about it that i wanted to make sure he knew what his options were and that he knew exactly what he was ordering.

me: we have three different kinds. pumpkin bread, lemon bread, and banana-

c: i want the white one with frosting or whatever on it!!

ok, i'm literally telling you what we have. you told me the sign just says loaves. i am helping you.

c: *i'm* the customer, you know!!

what the hell? it's just bread, calm down.

me: i know, it's just that i can't tell where-

c: it's ***your*** job to make ***my*** life easier!!

holy shit. where did that come from? did he think because i was wearing a green apron that meant i was supposed to be his personal servant? what did he expect me to say to that?

me: ok

that's all i could manage. i had to bite my tongue to keep myself from saying everything i was thinking at that moment. i stayed quiet. i rang him up. i took his payment. i gave him his change.

as he was leaving, he asked if they would call his name when his things were ready. i said no. we don't write on the cups at our store, instead we just enter the customer's name into our pos system. once an order goes through, a sticker with the name and order will get printed over by the cafe bar. sometimes, with certain orders, the pos system won't prompt me to enter a name. this is what i told him. he'll just need to pay close attention and listen for his order.

in reality, i never asked for his name. i didn't want to know his name. i wanted him gone.

now i understand that i have no idea what's going on in a person's life to make them lash out like that. but y'know what? i respect everyone who comes through my line until they give me reason not to. even when i'm having a bad day, i will be the best employee i can be. but i do no get paid enough to be treated like that. looking back on it now, i probably should've just assumed he wanted the lemon loaf once he said ""white bread"" and the conversation would have ended there. but there's still no excuse for him to be such an arrogant ass when i was just trying to help.

and i know this is nothing compared to other posts on here, but this guy infuriated me so much and i just really needed to tell someone about it.

so thank you for reading. hope you're having a great day/night wherever you are.",spinch19,tfys
756,“fuck! there goes my money!”,"sorry, but mobile bc i’m on break at work. also, kinda anticlimactic ending

tldr my coworker cussed loudly while 5 inches away from my turned-on microphone

characters: 

me - duh

s - other carhop

m - another carhop

k - crew guy (makes drinks and desserts, also takes orders, etc)

z - manager

 so i work at sonic drive-in, and as a carhop, one of my main responsibilities are taking people’s orders on my headset. we have a limited amount of headsets and they come in pairs for training purposes. at the time, k and i had matching headsets. 
m, s, and i were making drink carriers, because we were running out, and we were all on the same small table doing so. m, s, and z were having a conversation about how s was gonna take the sat soon and how she wanted to go to a specific community college. she was worried about getting a good enough score for her sat and z tells her that community colleges basically don’t care about the sat. at that moment, i click the button to start taking an order when suddenly, 

s (yelling) - “fuck! there goes my money!”

at the time, s was about 5 inches away from my face and the mike, so both k and i heard her loud and clear through the earphone, which meant that the customer probably heard what she said. i immediately apologize to the customer and take the order as normal, while k explains to s what happened. 

s is naturally freaked out, so she does not want to be the one to to take that person's meal out. she ends up having to, but since the customer did not say anything about it, neither did she. in fact, she got a tip. this lady must've either not understood her, or just decided not to make a big deal out of it.

759,how to talk to my boss about having to always work overtime + how to politely tell people to leave when it's closing time and they're not ready?,"hi, i'm wondering if anyone could give me some advice on how to politely handle situations where it's almost time to close and customers are still eating/wanting to order desserts/still drinking? kitchen closes at 21.30 for main courses and the restaurant at 22.00, and every day we get people who come at about 21.20 and order massive amounts of food even though i tell them that we close in half an hour. food comes usually pretty quickly, in 10-15 minutes max, but there's still not enough time to eat properly and when the clock strikes 22.00, i should be completely ready to close and that means cleaning, counting the till, everything. but because there are almost always customers still eating, i have to wait for them to slowly sip their wine and eat their food tiny bite by bite, and i usually get to leave somewhere around 23. and this is seriously starting to piss me off because i'm always scheduled to leave at 22.00 but it never actually happens so i can't make any plans because i never know how long it's going to take for me to get out. and i'm not even getting paid overtime, just the normal hourly wage.

my boss is italian and has the mindset of bending over backwards to please customers and he has told us servers that we should just let people be in peace no matter how long it takes. hell, even if people have been there for 3 hours already and are just talking i'm not allowed to usher them out even though it's past closing time. for some reason people can't seem to grasp time and just expect that they can stay as long as they like. i can't even deny them desserts if they want them, and since kitchen staff usually leaves at 22.00 even if there are customers still left, i have to go to make their tiramisus and panna cottas which is not in my job description.

lately i've been getting really irritated with this and i sometimes have to stop myself from telling people to get the fuck out when they should. honestly, i wish i could so they would understand that our restaurant is not their personal living room. i'm from a country where tipping is not a thing so it wouldn't really even bother me if people got pissed but my boss wouldn't probably like it. and it's not just me, all the other servers are just as annoyed with this as i am, and every single day we fight about who has to close (only one person closes) and thus stay overtime for who knows how long.

so i guess i have two questions here: how to grow a spine and politely but firmly tell customers that i'm sorry but they need to leave so i can close and how to talk to my boss that this just isn't fair to us servers? my boss isn't the easiest of people, he always expects exceptional work from us (for 11,30 euros per hour) and to do every single thing customers ask of us even if it inconveniences us. it would be pretty drastic, but sometimes i fantasise about just booting everyone out the door at 22.00 no matter how much food they have left so my boss would understand that this can't go on like this.

sorry for the rant and grammatical errors, a non-native english speaker here. and i'm aware that i probably sound really bratty about this, i'm just so tired. this should be just an easy job to get some extra pocket money while i study but it has become a major source of stress for me.",anyena,tfys
760,i spent about 5 minutes convincing him we didn't have red moscato,"apologies in advance for the long story.

i worked as both a server and a bartender for an expensive corporate company that won't be named. i have so many stories from my time working there, but this one happened pretty close to when i quit, so it's still fresh in my mind, and still makes me scratch my head to this day.

i was working on bar when it happened, and to really understand the ridiculousness of the situation, i need to give a brief description of the bar set up. behind the bar itself, we have a cooler with glass doors that has our bottled beer selection on one side, and our white wine selection on the other. above this cooler, we have a shelf with our red wines. we also have drink menus on bartop that list all of our wine options.

it was a pretty slow day, so i was just chilling by the bar register looking over my schedule and tidying up my station when a woman comes up to the bar. she seems nice enough despite having a ""can i speak to your manager haircut."" she begins browsing our wine selection and asks me about what we have...

woman: ""what kinds of sweet wines do you have?""

me: ""our sweetest wines are going to be our whites, and we have moscato, pinot grigio, riesling, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, and a white zinfandel. the moscato is going to be the sweetest, but the riesling and zinfandel are pretty sweet as well.""

woman: ""i think i'll go for the moscato.""

me: ""of course! would you like a 5 ounce pour or an 8 ounce pour?""

woman: ""what's the price difference?""

me: ""the 5oz will be about $8 and the 8oz will be about $10 after tax.""

woman, huffily: ""really? $10 for a glass of wine? fine. i guess i'll go ahead and do the 8oz anyways.""

me: ""haha, yeah, the drinks are a bit pricey.""

(considering we sell high end wine, $10 seems to be a decent price for a large glass, but that's just me)

*i proceed to pour her wine, she pays in cash (doesn't tip but it's a small bill so i don't really care) and goes to sit at a table by the bar to wait for her husband*

things are pretty peachy so far, until aforementioned husband arrives. he meets his wife at the table and then comes up to me to get her another glass of wine. 

husband: ""what kind of sweet wines do you have?"" (again? really?)

me: ""our sweetest is going to be our moscato.""

husband: ""do you have a red moscato?""

me: ""we do not unfortunately, we only have white moscato.""

husband: ""well, what do you have for reds.""

me: ""we have a cab, a merlot, and a couple pinot noirs available by the glass, as well as a red blend and a few others available in bottle.""

husband: ""but do you have a red moscato?""

me: ""no...we just have the white moscato.""

husband, slightly upset: ""okay. what do you have for sweet reds.""

me: ""well, we unfortunately don't have any reds that are going to be as sweet as a moscato, but the merlot is pretty good and is a bit sweeter than the other reds in my opinion.""

husband: ""so you don't have any sweet reds?""

me: ""no, we don't. i'm sorry. we do have one rose, the white zinfandel, that's pretty sweet though!""

husband: ""but no red moscato?""

me: ""no""

husband, gesturing to the cooler: ""okay, so what do you have in there?""

me, literally going in order and pointing out each wine: ""moscato, chardonnay, white zinfandel (the rose), pinot grigio, riesling, and sauvignon blanc.""

husband: ""is one of those a red moscato?""

me: ""no, the only non-white wine in here is the white zinfandel, which is our rose.""

husband shouts over to his wife: ""honey! she says they dont have a red moscato. come here!""

the wife comes back over.

woman: ""what sweet reds do you have?'

me: ""we don't really have anything as sweet as a moscato, but the merlot is pretty mild and is probably my favorite. i like sweet wines too!""

woman: ""well can i try it?""

husband: ""yeah, i'm not going to pay for a glass of wine if she doesn't like it""

(we aren't really supposed to do this but i oblige and let her sample it anyways)

woman, in disgust: ""oh god, that's disgusting. i'll just do another glass of the moscato.""

i pour her glass and she walks away. 

husband: ""how much is that going to be?""

me: ""that'll be $9.89!""

husband: ""seriously? $10 for some wine?""

he pays with a card and tips me $1 which was honestly more than i would have expected.

761,rain for a patio shift...,"so i’m scheduled for the patio tonight and it’s currently raining, according to the weather the % likelihood of rain will let up around 1-2 (11:30 currently, shift is at 5) and i’m wondering when i should call to ask if they want me there? there’s two patio servers and i haven’t seen anyone try to get their shift covered, meaning most likely no call outs and they never have more than 7 people inside. my fiancé said i should call while it’s raining, and no later than 2, but i feel like right now might be too early to call for a 5 o’clock shift, but i don’t want to call during the break in the rain...i also don’t want my coworker to beat me to calling and getting called off in case they want to keep one person just in case, as it was busy on the patio last night, but we don’t have umbrellas so no one will sit out there in the rain...i just don’t want to go to work and run other peoples food and make no money for myself when i could just relax at home. any advice?? 

also at 5 pm theres a 65% chance of light rain, at 6 a 60% chance of showers, and at 7 a 55% chance of showers, but predictions could change...",herowndelusion,tfys
762,the couple that wanted a gift card. an arby’s story.,"i used to work at arby’s. i’m known to be a little fire cracker in my family but i was also the sweetest person too. it was a friday night and we were super busy. football games were ending and hungry families were pouring in from the drive thru and the lobby. i was really good on working by myself so i had drive thru covered. the speaker dinged and a couple came through. 
“hi, welcome to arby’s. order when you’re ready.” i said. 
“hi, i just want a gift card.” the guy replied. i look over to my manager. 
“do we have some gift cards?” i asked. my manager nodded and continue to make sandwiches. 
“okay. if it’s easier, would you like to come inside so you don’t have to wait?” i ask. as i said, it’s super busy. 
“no, it’s too much work.”
“alright, just pull forward.” i turn off my headset and begin bagging orders. of course, there were so many people ordering at once that some of my orders got mixed up. i apologized to the waiting customers at the window and offered them a cookie or turnover while their food was being remade. they understood we were busy and it helped me keep calm. the night was starting to get a little stressful. i knew everyone was trying to get everything out so i ran around throwing down fries and cleaning tables while i waited for my orders to be done. finally, ten minutes had passed and the couple got to the window. 
“sorry about the wait-”
“yeah, that was ridiculous!” the lady said with her arms crossed. 
i took a deep breath. “what kind of gift card did you want sir? we have the $25 or the $50 one.”
the guy scowled at me. “um, the one with less money, duh. why did it take you so long to get us up here? that’s bad service.” he asked, also very aggravated. 
“i’m sorry sir, we’re so busy that some orders got mixed up and needed to be remade. i’ll go grab that gift card.” i close the window and walk to the back. “hey, i need a $25 gift card please.” 
my manager opens the safe to give me one. 
“oh, i guess we ran out,” she said. “let them know that you’re sorry about the inconvenience and offer them a drink for the wait.”
that’s just great. i hesitate, knowing they would be mad about it. i walk back to the window. “okay, my manager just informed me that we just ran out. i’m so sorry about the inconvenience. can i offer you a drink?” let me tell you something. that couple glared at me with the most pissed looks ever. 
“are you fucking serious?! you made us wait ten minutes just to tell us you don’t have a gift card!” the guy yelled. 
“sir i asked if-”
“you’re a fucking idiot for not telling us sooner,” the lady next to him pointed at me, “you should be fired for this! we just wasted our time!” 
i felt my face getting hot and my fists clenching. i knew i was going to blow up if this kept going. 
“i asked if you wanted to come inside but you said no. you chose to wait.” i defended myself. 
“it doesn’t matter. next time, you should tell the customer before they wait you fucking moron. women can work for shit!” the guy said, putting his car back into drive. 
“yeah bitch.” the girl then flipped me off. 
it was at that point that i lost it. i stuck my head out the window and screamed, “i just found out you stupid bitch!” i slammed the window shut and stormed to the back. they sped off. i was so angry that my hands were shaking. everyone in the lobby fell silent from hearing the whole argument. i glanced over my shoulder and started to cry. i cry when i get too angry at times. my manager came off backline and told me to sit in the back to cool off. my coworkers cheered me on for standing up to them. no one has ever had the guts to do it in fear of losing their job. the other manager was in the bathroom so she didn’t know what just happened. about 5 minutes later the phone rang. my other manager answered to hear the lady “sobbing” on the other end. 
“yes, i would like to report that your worker at the drive thru cussed me out and i didn’t do anything to her. we wanted a gift card and she made us wait ten minutes for it just to tell us she didn’t have one. then she started to scream at us. we didn’t feel safe so we drove off but then she called me a stupid bitch. you need to do something about her. she’s crazy.” the lady told with an obviously fake upset voice. 
“okay, i will make sure to handle it.” my manager replied. “sorry about what happened ma’am.” 
“yeah, you better handle it.” the lady said in an angry voice before hanging up the phone. 
i had gained my composure and was continuing with drive thru when she pulled me aside. 
“i have a question for you.” she asked with a serious tone. 
“yes ma’am?” i asked. 
“did you, uh... did you call a lady a stupid bitch?”
i smirked, “yes.” i didn’t regret one bit of it. 
she sighed, “why did you do that?”
“in my defense, they cussed me out first. i even apologized to them but they kept going so i called the lady a stupid bitch.” 
“really? because she claimed that they didn’t do anything.” 
“everyone in the lobby and all my coworkers heard the whole thing.”
she glanced over at some customers by the counter. they nod in agreement with me. 
“okay. next time this happens, come and get a manager so we can handle the situation.”
“alright. but if you guys are busy then i’m going to do my own thing.” i joke around. 
so yeah, that was my friday night and the best part was that i never got in trouble for cussing at the couple. ",Xo_Unlimited,tfys

764,"i have never seen prime rib that looked like this, i have never seen prime rib that looked like this, i have never seen prime rib that looked like this, i have never seen prime rib that looked like this.","sorry i was not the server these people were seated behind me at it our local aussie steak house. 

this woman makes this statement repeatedly. server offers replacement, offers substitution, offers manager. but all this woman would say was i have never seen prime rib that looked like this.

this is all these 4 people talk about for 45 minutes and bring it up every time their server checks with them. finally she had the manager come over. prime rib lady points to the picture of the prime rib on the menu and points to her plate and says her meat doesn't look anytime like the picture. the manager politely points out but the picture is of a 16-ounce prime rib and she ordered an 8 ounce prime rib, she noted that her meat would be much thinner than the one in the picture. the woman also complained about how dry and over-seasoned it was. the manager again politely pointed out that she ordered a well-done seasoned and seared piece of meat and that it indeed would be dry and heavily seasoned. the manager then offered her multiple options of how to make it right and prime rib complaining woman declined all of them. the manager left the table and yes you guessed it the conversation still went on about how she had never seen a piece of prime rib look the way hers did.

to the credit of the manager she never comped the meal. it was all i could do not too lean over the both to look at her meal. other than a need to complain ad nauseum i am at a loss as to what that woman wanted because she never once asked to be comped her meal 

my medium rare seasoned and seared prime rib was delicious.

765,i think i have a stalker,"required mobile formatting explanation.

it’s a long one, but worth the read. 

this should be on a throw away account, but i could use the excitement in my life. 

so as a server, i’m a very flirtation individual. it’s just my personality. guy, girl, doesn’t matter, i’ll do anything to get a smile or a laugh out of someone. 

it’s the middle of wednesday night rush and i get two early 20s females sat in my section. i go over, go through my monologue and notice she’s not paying attention and staring at her phone. 

i have a rule at my table, if you can’t make eye contact and speak to me like an adult, i take your phone. well she was in the middle of not knowing how to respond to a mans dick pic, so i responded for her. we chatted throughout the meal and eventually they left. as i was cleaning my table, i noticed i had my signed credit card receipt and a piece of paper with a snapchat name. being curious of which one it was, i added it just to know. 

we sent a couple messages back and forth, but nothing more than joking about the dick pic and how i responded to it. the next morning, i sent a picture a new shirt i had to everyone in my recents, which included her, and she responded with heart eyes. i’m married with a child, and uninterested, so i ignored the response and went to work. 

i get to my serving job that evening where i have my family coming to that night. my mom moved back up from alabama so they all came to eat in my section so i could see her. 
so at this party was my mom, dad, step mom, sister, aunt, niece, nephew, nana, poppy, wife, daughter, and wife’s best friend. 

i get a facebook messenger notification from an unknown account that reads, “hey, we have mutual friends in common, are you the guy who works at [insert restaurant name here]?”

very confused, i ask who our mutual friends are when i receive a snapchat notification, girl from last night messages me and says, “i am sooooooo sorry about my best friend.”

i later was looking through snap stories and noticed she was coming to the restaurant to have a drink. i knew they were coming to my section so her best friend could see who she was talking about. 

now my only available table is the table next to my family. 

i lean over to my wife and fill her in on this situation. now we’re semi-open so it’s not unusual for us to see each other flirting with others, however, i wasn’t extremely attracted to her, and my whole family was there. 

so income 3 adults and 3 children sitting next to my family. i go over and start my sales pitch and as i’m speaking, my daughter jumps up and is trying to play with the kids. i remind her that she needs to keep seated because she could fall and hurt herself, and the tension at the table skyrockets. i laughed uncontrollably. while i’m busy taking care of my other tables, i get texts from my wife and her best friend about the women staring at them. 

now at this point, it’s evidently clear i am married and a father, also which is evident on my facebook profile which they clear investigated before coming out. 

my family leaves, they stay a small bit longer and i cash them out and head to close up. not even 5 minutes after she left the building, she snap chatted me and said, “i’ll keep it a secret if you do.”

i literally facepalmed. she’s the cousin of one of my coworkers and is married. so after that message, i simply blocked her. my wife and i don’t keep secrets. 

i wake up this morning for work and i get a message from her best friend again asking what is going on? clearly wanting to know why i blocked her. 

she showed up at the restaurant again tonight. not my section, but was in the bar.

766,the secrets of a fine dining server.,"i’m writing this for the new peeps out there to clear a few things up.
1. starting out in the industry is hard as hell but if you stick with it you start to see the benefits.
i saw a post on here talking about making $80 dollars a night. 
the truth is once you graduate to high levels of serving that number turns into $200 - $600 a night. 
the point of saying this is that if you actually put in the years, serving is a great back up job.
(a lot of fine dining servers make over 50k)
2. your gonna work long hours but as you move up the amount of work drops.
3. your check average is your life , the higher the number the more you make. the added bonus is a happy boss 
4. it doesn’t matter how good you are or the money is if your work place is toxic get the fuck out. no amount of money is worth being miserable.  ",[deleted],tfys

768,we're shutting down!,"the end, fin, final stop; termination. we are being shut down, and that's a good thing!

&amp;#x200b;

 [i've posted on here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromyourserver/comments/amehp8/a_table_would_be_nice_weve_been_waiting_for_like/) about working in a small, but busy (in the weekends, that is!) place. nice little bar and grill with an american theme flung at it, which stuck here and there. we've been open for almost 5 years now, i've been the manager for almost a year. when i first started there, i was less than impressed to be honest. i was supposed to co-manage the place with this other dude, but he had a burn-out after three weeks. which is fine, i prefer managing solo. most of the old team left and i was able to create my own, hard-working team. and clean the place, god damn, was it filthy in there. 

&amp;#x200b;

when the place opened up 5 years ago, we were hugely popular. lobster and burgers, combined with gt's which were then getting popular, was what made it happen. two very busy years ensued but somehow they failed to turn a profit; mostly because they found it more important to be busy than to be cost efficient and anything went, really. 

&amp;#x200b;

now, three years after that, we've never been able to live up to the hype of the first two years. we started on a peak, but were not able to stay there and it was a slow decline from there. ever since i've started working there i had a feeling that something needed to be done about the place. the numbers were fine, we are making a decent profit, but the concept felt out-dated. people working there for a couple of years felt stuck in the past, always referring to how it used to be and somewhat desperately clinging to those glorious time, refusing to face the fact that those times are no more all the while claiming ""change is good""! as if they believe it.  


three weeks ago the owners sat us all down, one by one, telling us the news of the shut down at the end of the month. two weeks prior they had informed us that they'd want to sit down with all of us to talk about ""our vision of the place, our future there, and just to get to know each other a little better"". my intentions were to, once more, explain to them that we need to do something about this past glory, the people stuck in it and the out dated concept, or i'd be looking for employment elsewhere.  


before i could start my little rant, how-ever, they told me we're shutting down. they were surprised to me almost applauding their announcement, but they understood once i explained my frustration. we talked about the team i've trained and where to ""place"" them (they have about 20 bars in total), telling them i'd only be ok with this ""sit down down"" with everyone if they'd also, right away, offer every one of them a different place to work. once that was figured out, they offered me a managing job at one of their new projects; a 1.000 seat bar in a very, very busy area of the city; an amazing (and likely never dull!) challenge.  


so now i'm running a sinking ship, so to say. day by day more people find out we're closing down and i have to explain the same thing over and over again. frustrated or sad regulars, worried comp-lleagues, and of course my own team. i've worked in many bars, but i've never closed one down like this. it's a strange feeling, honestly, but i'm sure we can make the best of it. and honestly; i can't wait to get out of this place.

772,"""i didn't realise i'd have to pay""","i work at a new restaurant that has gotten very popular. we serve one kind of food and you can add a bunch of toppings. the menu is very clear about how much each topping costs. or you can buy a premade option for a set price.

it's the morning so it's just myself, one new server, and the owner. we get this 4 top of young 20 something girls. first one waited over 30 minutes for the second to arrive. another 30 or so minutes for the other 2. they were in my section but the other server took their order while i spoke to the owner.

they all went with choosing their own toppings. once they got their food they flagged down the new server and ordered hot sauce, bbq glaze, and blueberries compote. which are all listed on the menu for £1 each.

they hung out for ages. they flagged the owner down because one of them said he had to leave asap and wanted to pay for her food. i printed the bill, which includes 10% charge. most restaurants around here have it. their total was a little over £60.

after watching them scour the check for ages i ask if they need the card machine. they say yes. so i bring in over and they say ""oh sorry. we want the service charge taken off. we will tip though!! don't worry"" so i tell them i'll have to get management to do it. 

i come back with the new bill. it's now £50 something. i take 3 of their card payments and see the last one waiting with £11 pounds in hand. i tell her there is £14 remaining. she goes ""oh yeah. well i guess i'll pay for them if i have to but no one explained to me i'd be charged for these sides. i thought they were just free dipping sauces""...right...let me go talk to the manager...explain to him. but since nearly all the bill has been paid off we can't remove items anymore. so he just took out £3 from the till to refund them.

773,couple expected their meal to be free i guess,"i'm a waitress/cook/host at our local pizza hut. i've worked there for almost 3 years and i know our deals pretty well and i'm getting used to the new prices (they bumped them up a while ago)
i basically work wherever they need me and this night i was working as the closing waitress.
so i was working on the floor by myself because it was a thursday and thursday's are not that busy, usually.
i can't remember how busy it was that night but at around 8:30 ish (we close at 10) i had 4 people come in (including 2 adults and 2 teens, to get a table for about 8 people. so as usual i start setting up the table and i take the drinks of the people who are there. everything is going fine, in fact the 4 that originally came in were great, it was the other two that weren't. so after everyone's drink is out i start taking orders, these are two separate tickets, one for the first 4 that came in and another for the 2 adults and their 3 kids. i take the original 4's order and then i go to the two adults. so they order a medium cheese pizza, some wings, bread sticks or garlic knots i can't remember which exactly and a medium pizza with a speciality recipe; all of these items are off of our $5 line up menu with the specialty pizza costing $4 extra.
also, after all the orders are complete, i like to repeat everything so i don't miss anything or put anything in wrong, and everyone tells me that everything is right so i place the order.
so the food comes out and i take it out to the table. and something was wrong with the wings i put in (i can't remember if they came out wrong or if they were coming out later than expected) so i apologise and make sure some wings are made, so that was obviously our fault not theirs and i offer a discount and i give them extra wing sauce for free (it's usually .50 extra). then the pizza comes out and they said they ordered a pepperoni... excuse me? i tell them they told me cheese, and they say ""no we wanted pepperoni"", now i'm annoyed because i know i repeated this order to them and they said it was correct.
i tell my manager, and she tells the cook to make another pizza and she tells me to let them have the other pizza and we don't charge for the 2nd. so then the pizza comes out and everything else is going fine. i'm checking on the table as much as possible and refilling drinks. so it comes time for the bill.
i give the bills to both sides, both also have discounts. so the original 4 comes up and pays for their food and thanks me for my service (i messed up on their order too but i decided not to charge for the mess up and they were very nice about it). the couple comes up and is questioning the amount i charged them and is wondering why their bill isn't cheaper..... excuse me?
items all came off of our $5 line up menu so each food item is $5, only one of the 5 people on their ticket got a water, and i didn't charge for one of the kids drinks because i felt bad, i didn't charge for extra sauce for wings or for the 2nd pizza.
i put in their ticket again, just to see how much it would have been without the discount and with extra items that they received and they were saving a good $15-$20.
they tried to argue that they shouldn't have to pay that much, luckily my manager was next to me and she explained that they saved a lot of money with the discount and things i didn't charge and there was no other discount we were going to apply. realising that they would not win, they unwillingly paid for their food. i received no tip from their side but the other side left me $4.

774,that one time a crappy table made my manager throw an ashtray full of shrimps at the wall,"i once worked at a pretty busy sports themed restaurant. i had a 4 top come in one night and they were probably in their early 20's. seemed like cool peoples. the one dude ordered a triple play which was chicken tenders, ribs and shrimp on a skewer. when it came out he said that the shrimps werent fully cooked. i took it back to the kitchen, explained what the customer said and i brought out a new batch for the fella. this fella eats all his ribs and when i come back for a drink refill he tells me that the shrimps still aren't cooked all the way. now the grill was a flat grill so it wasn't going to leave those lined grill marks. i explained that and asked if he wanted another batch or would he like a substitute. he said he wanted another batch. cool. get it and bring it out. ask if its ok and he ignores me. i bring out the bill and its over $100. they pay cash and leave. when i walk over to collect the payment i can see that they left me exact money, down to the pennies. they also put all the shrimps in the ash tray and wrote on a napkin ""does this fucking look cooked to you?!"". 

at our restaurant we had a policy that if we were stiffed, like i clearly was, the manager would give us a flat fee ""tip"", which was pretty nice of them. i take the bill and the ashtray of shrimps and note to my manager and tell him what happened. he calmly stood up, took the ashtray of shrimps and fast pitched it into the wall. its shattered everywhere. he then sat down and gave me my tip money. he literally didn't utter a single word.",[deleted],tfys
775,caramel sauce goes on the bottoms,"i’ve worked in the restaurant industry but this particular tale is from my time working for the big coffee chain. i hope y’all don’t mind as i’ve seen cafe stories here before so i assume they’re fair game.

i’m working drive thru, which is my favorite spot. i’ve found my best customer service is with exchanges that last about one minute. i’m smiley, i’m upbeat, i give them their drink, they drive off into the horizon. it’s midday, pretty slow, when a girl pulls in ordering a caramel macchiato and pulls up to the window. this girl is one of those people you can tell straightaway is a diva. i say how are you doing today, and she continues to just type away on her phone, sunglasses on, tight ponytail, yoga clothes, the whole nine yards. i’m like whatevs, i’m cool with no small talk. the girl making bevs hands me her drinks and she explodes. 

why is my caramel sauce on the top?! it goes on the bottom !! what the hell !! she explodes. practically throws the drink at me.

i explain, somewhat curtly, no, caramel drizzle goes on the top of a drink, hence why it’s called caramel drizzle. if you would like caramel sauce on the bottom, you have to ask for an upside down caramel macchiato.

but i’ve never had to do that at any other location ?? blah blah blah *insinuates we’re idiots*

while this is going on, the girl on bar redoes her drink with the drizzle on the bottom. she comes up next to me and sweetly says “here’s your upside down caramel macchiato, have a nice day!” and the look on this woman’s face is priceless, i couldn’t see her eyes but i’m sure they were beaming lasers. she drives off without another word. we have a great laugh over our small victory.

what i find interesting is these characters really only appear at this chain. i currently work for a much smaller coffee chain (about 20 locations in washington state) and while i’ve had unhappy customers, they’ve never lost their cool. although i’m probably jinxing that now. 
 
i hope that woman pulled a muscle doing her pilates or screaming at an employee. to this day though, she’s the subject of my favorite getting back at a customer story, even if it seems somewhat minor (i’ve read some fascinating stories on here this seems to kind of pale in comparison to). passive aggressiveness is key.

777,some people...,"it was about a week ago in a saturday night bar rush at the 24 diner chain i serve at. since everyone except myself was apparently too sick to work, i was the only one on the floor, and my dining room was a mess because it was bad timing on top of bad timing. for every check i cashed out, two more tables came in. it was one of those nights.

i've been a server for a few years at this place so i know the drill and can usually handle all of this stress. but that night was bad because of some issues at home that were on my mind too. as i'm about 12 steps behind and running out of places to seat theses new customers, an acquaintance from high school came in and wanted a milkshake (which is the last thing i needed added onto my list).

i told him it might be a few minutes, but he said he was a server so he understood and told me to take my time. so amidst my rush to catch up i hardly noticed he had started to bus all of my tables. probably about 14-15 in all. all had to do was wipe them down he even brought me all of my tips. i almost wanted to cry tears of joy.

he asked me if there was anything else i needed. i told him no and i thanked him so much with his milkshake i was finally able to get to. he asked me what i owed him for the shake and i told him;

""absolutely nothing"". 

and he was humble enough to actually refuse the shake on me. i told him it was the very least i could do for doing me such a huge solid. i then handed him another few dollars and told him his next one was on me.
 
fast forward an hour and the rush is done, but tables are still kind of trickling in, but i'm keeping up now. another former server of the same restaurant comes in to get some food. and while she waits she rolls almost an entire tray of silverware for me. again i was astonished.

some people.

some people just get what it means to just be a decent human being. thes people owe me nothing yet they did so much for me that night by doing so little and wanting nothing extra in return.

i hope i was able to get across to them how much they really impacted my night in such a positive manner. i'm usually a negative nancy but that night these two servers restored my faith in humanity a little bit. so thank you two and everyone else out there who does even the smallest things for your fellow restaurant co-workers. because some days, for some people, it's the little things that mean the most.",jvsiii,tfys
778,"i want to speak to a man, only!","so i’m a manager, but this was a great story from a really shitty table of assholes on valentine’s day. 

i work at an upscale casual restaurant and our menu is “tapas” family share style. a few things led to this interaction with these guests. the table was 12 men (yes... on valentine’s day, romantic - they were in town for a convention.) we were slammed and had one of the bartenders take a few tables. the bartenders are trained to serve, but taking a table that large was definitely overwhelming for him. 

he sold them on our set dinner which is x salads/dips, x apps, x entrees. he mistakenly told them they got 1 of each. mistake #1. i was working expo that night because we were short in the kitchen and our chef was on the line so i saw it come out 12/12/12 and ran over to him and explained his mistake. he corrected it with the table. okay... it’s fixed. 

another thing is that all our food goes out as it’s ready. so sometimes salad is coming out at the same time as apps/entrees. just depends on the timing of the kitchen. servers explain this in their spiel. it’s very rare that a salad comes out at the same time as an entree. but vday was slammed. i run an entree to them and one guest hasn’t received an app. here we go. 

the main guest flipped out on me. i explained the concept of the restaurant to him again very politely and he started cursing me out like trash on his shoe. i apologized to him and said i’m a manager, what can i do for him in the meantime, could i get him another cocktail on me? told him that it should be on it’s way out in a few minutes and he called me a “stupid bitch” and he only wanted to talk to a man and didn’t want to talk to a dumb woman. great!

lucky for him, our gm is also a woman. i sent her over and he went crazy. it was fucking great. suffice it to say they did not leave happy even after we sent them out extra food and comped half their check.",casti33,tfys
779,my worst table ever,"so i've been browsing reddit for almost a year now without posting anything but after tonight i had to share this story with you guys.

sorry for the format i'm on my phone.

so i've been a server/bartender for almost 6 years now at various restaurants, but tonight puts the ice on the cake for experiences that i've had.
so i work at a popular late night spot that is known for half price apps and two for one drinks, so we get pretty busy at night when happy hour starts. 
anyways i have a full section at this point serving and i get sat out of my section with these two ladies. they want drinks from the bar and of course i get it for them and get their apps started at the same time. i bring their drinks shortly after greeting them and inform them that the apps have been started. i go on about my other tables because we are busy and i notice that their appetizers are being dropped off to their table. at that point i start their entrees because i knew it would take them a little while to eat their apps and check in on them. everything seemed pretty normal and they were ok with their food so i go back to my other tables. a few minutes later i check back on them and they want me to pack up their entrees to go since they're getting full on their apps. no problem. i do as they ask and drop it off when it's done. i ask if they wanted to go ahead and pay checks since they seemed done, at which they agree and give me payments via credit cards. i proceed with processing the payments and drop it off and this is when the fun starts...

i give the payments back to them and tell them to have a good night. them* ""oh so these quesadillas were overcooked and hard, also these pastas that we got seem like they are under cooked and hard as well. me* "" well i mean i'm sorry for your experience but why didn't you say anything when i dropped it off or after i checked on you?"" *them "" well we didn't really notice at first and we're telling you now"" me* "" well i wish you would have said something earlier because i could have taken said apps or entrees off the check but since i already processed your payments there's not much i can do."" them* ""oh well can we talk to a manager."" me* ""sure i'll let him know"".
so my manager goes and talks to them. he gives them the benefit of the doubt and goes out of his way to void their payments and comp items off the check so we can process a new payment.

i go and explain to them that we had to void both payments in order to bring back the check and comp things off. they agree and during the process off us processing the new payments one of the guest approach us... "" what the hell are y'all doing?!?"" me*"" i'm sorry what?"" her* ""what is this extra charge on my card?"" me* well like i explained to you we had to void the original charge in order to comp these items that you didn't like. her* ""well why do i have an extra charge? i'm not paying extra money for this bulls*** service and food."" me* ""don't worry that charge will go away after a day or so since it was voided, you have nothing to worry about"". her* ""no, f*** that give me my card i'm leaving this place."" me* ""mam there's really no reason for that kind of language."" her* ""no f*** that, give me my card you little b****."" i give her, her card. me* "" you have a wonderful night mam."" her* ""f*** you."" me* ""bye now."" me thinking* ""don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.""

anyways sorry for how long and poorly  i must have wrote this post. i've just been. a server/bartender for many years and never had a table like this so i thought you guys would enjoy.
anyways good luck to all y'all bartenders and servers out there on reddit.",insanehobo22,tfys
780,customer calls me to tell me... nothing?,"first post here, the usual disclaimers etc. this one isn't as exciting maybe, but it confused tf out of me and my employer regardless.

i work as a waitress in a small local turkish restaurant/take-out/delivery-service and usually know most orders that go through. however this was last saturday evening, aka busy hours. i knew there one order for spareribs because i saw them out and ready to be prepared. unusual but it didn't concern me since i had tables to attend. 15 minutes later the phone rings and i pick it up, expecting an order. 

cast: me, c (customer)

me: good evening, *restaurant* here, how can i help you?

c: yeah i just ordered a spareribs from you guys for €14 and i just wanted to let you know this is unacceptable.

(now the ribs are €13 so idk why he paid 14 for them, but it didn't sound like he was complaining about the price)

me: i'm sorry? i don't think i understand. do you want me to give you to someone with authority?

c: no. i just want to let you know it was tasteless and horrible and you should never serve them to anyone ever again.

me: i'm sorry about that sir. is there anything you want me to do about it?

c: no. *hangs up*

i just put the phone away, look at my boss, who was next to me preparing other orders. he was just as confused as i was, and there wasn't really anything more we could do with it. 

why do this? it's not a review. you didn't like the food and then... ? if we can't do anything about one tasteless meal for you, why hog the line for it?",Catorsomethingiguess,tfys
781,he wanted his tip back!,"this story still cracks me up. it's hilarious to me.

&amp;#x200b;

i worked in a small bar, mostly regulars, you were always working alone. nothing too interesting.

&amp;#x200b;

every now and then a new face would show up, and i would try to make them feel as comfortable as possible, as we desperately needed more customers. i would chat with them, make some jokes etc. over a span of around 3 weeks this guy came over around 2 times a week. great! i thought, i got him hooked on the beers, he enjoys the chatting and he's not a weirdo. we can use someone like that (mostly the money) in the bar.

&amp;#x200b;

we just chatted about random stuff and at some point dating came up. a few weeks before this chat, i happened to meet this guy (at the bar i worked at actually) . me and this guy i met at the bar had a few dates since we met, and were going on a date the day after this guy asked this question. so i told the guy excitedly i had a date lined up and was really looking forward to it. he seemed kinda bummed, but whatever. i wasn't interested in him that way and just wanted customers in the bar, so we kept chatting for a few hours and after that he left.

&amp;#x200b;

i didn't think much about it anymore and a couple of days later he came back in. the place was busy. my boss was sitting at the bar enjoying her time and i was having fun talking to the regulars and this guy. the guy ordered a beer for 3 euro and tipped me 2. very generous! i told him thanks and joyfully kept working, chatting, helping people, all that stuff.

after about half an hour or so his beer was empty so i asked him if i could get him anything. he told me yes, and wanted another beer. then while i was pouring his beer he asked me how my date was. i told him it went great and we had another one scheduled for the next day. he told me he was happy to hear that. i was feeling good and put his beer down in front of him, after which i told him his total would be 3 euro for the beer. he then proceeded to give me 2 euro.

&amp;#x200b;

i looked at him and told him; ""i'm sorry, but your total is 3 euro. this is not enough"" he then exclaimed he just tipped me 2 euro and since my dating life was going so great i wasn't going to need his tip, so to just take it away from the tip. i stared at him in disbelief but decided it wasn't worth the fight, or the risk to burst out laughing directly into his face and went down back to the till, to my tip jar to proceed to take out the remaining amount from the tip he gave me earlier.

&amp;#x200b;

my boss saw me take out money from the tip jar after which she asked me what i was doing. i explained her the situation and she burst out laughing. i had to go to the kitchen for a bit to not do the same.

&amp;#x200b;

this guy kept coming back for 3 months. at that time my date, by that point boyfriend knew about the story and was at the bar regularly to spend some time with me since we had opposing schedules (he was in construction working from 5am, i would usually finish work at 3am) and every single time i could see this shit grin smile on his face every time this guy would come to the bar to ask me how my dates are going and i had to do my very best to not burst our laughing as soon as i saw the guy.

&amp;#x200b;

it's been 5 years, and still when we see this guy walk around in town, me, my boyfriend and (now ex) boss, giggle whenever we see them.

&amp;#x200b;

in other words: don't ask for your tip back when your bartender had a nice date unless you want to be the laughing stock of the town.

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr; got a nice tip, till the guy realised i was actually dating someone, so he used the tip he left me earlier that evening to pay for his beer.",CaveFlavored,tfys
782,"pros/cons of this particular restaurant job, seeking advice","i got a job offer at this small family owned sushi restaurant. i don't have much serving experience so i am seeking advice.

small restaurant, around 16 tables, sells ramen and sushi. 

\- 15% of server tips are taken for the kitchen (common or not?)

\- no busser

\- only opens night shifts (i guess a pro?)

\- 3-4 servers on at the same time, all work from opening shift to closing (so 3:30-9:30)

\- tips are pooled (how does everyone feel about this)?

\- expected tips are 80-120 a night per server, around 6 hours of work, weekend nights are 120-180, probably 150 average.

\- i assume it will be high turnover rate for such a small restaurant, again no busser so we'd be bussing everything.

783,a birthday surprise.,"i am a server at a national chain, and even on a ""bad day,"" the money is still pretty good. 

there was a scandal with some management about a month ago and so while they're trying to ""clean house,"" we are pretty short staffed. 

tuesday, i was supposed to be on for the evening shift (4:30-11ish), and got a text from my (favorite) manager at 9:30am asking if i could come in and double. checked with my babysitter and she agreed to take my son the extra time so in to work i went. 

how doubles work for us is you'll work the morning shift (11-3) check out, clean and stock, roll some silverware, clock out for an hour, then come back for the evening. 

so i am down to my last booth. they have their food and refills, check was taken care of, and they were kinda just hanging out. not a problem. i got started on my cleaning. 

we have those little shark vacuums to use and i had just finished up, and went to pull the handle back in the upright position and the thing literally snapped off. i gasped in surprise and they turned and saw me kinda freak out for a minute. 

told my manager, he wasn't that upset (thankfully we had backups) but i was informed that repair costs would be deducted from my check. 

checked on my booth again and this lovely couple asked me if i had a few minutes to talk. i said sure and sat with them. she immediately hits me with ""you look like you're having a terrible day, what's going on?"" 

so i told her about getting called in and having to miss an entire day with my son, i hurt my ankle on monday and it's still kinda sore, and now i just broke this vacuum (note: i did not mention to her that i will have to pay for it). 

then she tells me that even though i'm going through all that, the service was great and they were happy they decided to eat at our restaurant today instead of somewhere else. she asks if i have any plans for wednesday, so i mentioned i was taking my son on a lunch date for my birthday and then working the evening shift. she said she and a couple other mom's hang out every other wednesday with the kids and she would love for me to join at some point in the future and gave me her phone number (no pressure to contact) in case i would like that. i thanked her and said i needed to get back to work but i really appreciated talking to her. 

she then wishes me a happy early birthday and then hands me a flippin 50 dollar bill as my tip. on a $24.37 ticket. i went back to the office and cried for about 3 minutes. 

but wait! there's more. i got to work yesterday and was told there were flowers for me on the desk. at first i thought my so was being cheeky and also sent flowers to work (i had received  flower delivery that morning at home but my so is the type to go over the top). i opened the card and bless that lady because [she sent me flowers to work for my birthday](https://imgur.com/a/rvucqta) on top of that 200% tip.

784,"“this place is beneath me, and you’re racist!!!!”- my crazy customer","okay guys, buckle up because this one’s a doozy! i’m on mobile, so apologies for any weird formatting.

background: i work at a semi nice, local italian restaurant. i have been working there for about a month now, and it’s my first serving job. i’d say i am a decent server, orders are always correct, i’m friendly, etc. i am also a full time college student, working in a college town. and finally, i’m a 5’0” babyfaced girl.

the beginning :  our host called off tonight, so the 4 servers were answering phones, seating, and bussing tables. i am on the phone taking a to-go order when in walks the horrible customer, now referred to as hc (hc was african american, which is important later) . by the time i was off the phone, another server sat hc, and they let me know he was in my section. great, i go talk to him, he’s friendly, get him a beer, and then head back to get him a glass of water as well.  i take his order, which was just an app (calamari) and then go check on my other 4 tables, one of which was a 6 top. while i was talking to my other tables, his calamari came up, and since i was busy, another server took it to him. great, thanks man! i realize about 20 seconds after the app got sat down that the other server and i hadn’t brought a plate or a fork. usually not a big deal, most people just eat straight off the plate, but i went ahead and grabbed one and a roll of silverware and headed over to hc. i placed said plate and silverware on his table. the incident is as follows:

hc: i’m about to lose my fucking mind

me: excuse me? why?

hc: i think you know why i’m gonna lose my fucking mind!

me: no sir, i’m sorry, why?

hc:  no one brought me a fucking plate or fucking silverware, how am i gonna eat my calamari without a fucking plate or fucking silverware???!!!

me: *gesturing at plate and silverware i brought* i’m sorry about that, i brought you some!

hc: fucking finally

now i go straight to the kitchen and tell the owner/chef what happened. at this point i was pretty shaken up, because who talks to a person like that? manager has my back, says he has no right to talk to me like that, and says will watch out for me. i go check on hc once more, he’s somewhat polite and everything is good. i print out his check, because at this point i just want him out. i wait a little longer, then go ask if he wants to order a main or something, and he gets even crazier. he informs me that he’s worked for “some of the best restaurants” and that “this place is beneath him”. he says he was planning on ordering more, but now he “doesn’t feel comfortable.” my manager sees him spazzing, and comes to my rescue. hc proceeds to ask why the server who sat him didn’t put him in their section, then answers the question himself by saying when he served he didn’t want to wait on black people, so he called her racist for not taking him (even though it was my turn it the rotation) and then calls me a horrible server and also racist. threatens to write a horrible trip advisor review.  yadayadayada, manager comps his bill and gives him a gift card. i walk by and he asks me for change for a 20, so i hand him a 10 and he tells me to keep the change as a tip. wtf? i walk away, he’s still sitting there 10 minutes later so i go over and apologize that he had a bad experience, and i just lose it and burst into tears. i’ve seen posts about people losing their jobs over less than this, and i can’t afford that. he grabs my hand and says “go wipe your face, don’t let anyone ever see you cry” and shit then admits that he was being an asshole and how when he served he was always worried everyday that’s it was gonna be the day he got fired. if you had worked the industry and felt that, why would you want to make anyone else feel that way? anyways hc leaves finally, i’m upset but still have tables so i’m trying to be cheerful. que hc walking back in, asking to speak to the manager. fuck. go get manager, apparently he was very apologetic and felt bad that i cried because “i look so young”. anyways tonight sucked, and i really hope he never gets put in my section again. sorry for the rant/ long post, this was just so ridiculous.

tl;dr: customer blows up on me for not being him a plate and fork, calls me racist, still tips me, then comes back later to apologize because he made me cry because i was afraid to get fired",meaggymoo,tfys

we're a franchise corporation but the rumor is, is we're gonna hire someone outside of the this company. usually it's other stores who transfer over but that's not available. so we're gonna straight up hire a manager who has never worked in this chain restaurant.

787,are you calling me a liar?,"this happened this past sunday. i was on a double, bartending in the morning and cocktail at night. i usually take a short break in between shifts (really helps my mental state refresh to begin a new shift) but i wasn’t going to get one because we had a reservation of 25 at the same time my relief got there and no one else could take it. so, i’m already a little annoyed, but figured fuck it, last time i took a party i got tipped $150. so might as well make the best of it. 

it started out okay, the “host” was very nice and polite the entire time. i started taking drinks as people were showing up. a couple guests ordered some virgin drinks, one lady asks me to add alcohol in hers. no problem. 

bring out the drinks, the one with alcohol comes in a big schooner glass (basically a huge bowl.) and the virgin drinks come in mason jars. that’s how they are meant to be served. one woman who was sitting next to the lady with alcohol calls me over and asks me why she didn’t get a drink like hers. i explained she ordered a virgin drink and if she’d like me to i can remake it and add a shot. she agrees so i put it in and bring it out. she goes “that looks exactly the same.” why yes ma’am, because it is a blended drink, you’re not going to be able to see the alcohol particles floating around. but i didn’t say that, i just let her taste it for herself.

anyways, from there her attitude just leaked out at a steady pace for the rest of the meal. not even half of the party is there yet, i’m back in there ordering drinks for the newcomers when she demands to order. i say “oh we’re ready to order? is it ok if i run to put in these drinks and come back? i just don’t want them to wait a long time” they agree. i come back and try to take their order... now they rudely tell me they’re gonna wait. ok. host wants appetizers, orders the platter no bacon. lady says “i’ll order the same thing with bacon”. i bring them out, suddenly it’s “i didn’t want this. i wanted only loaded skins.” ok, well i misunderstood but i can get you more skins! no, she insists this is fine. 

they order and i’ll spare you all the ways she was rude while i did that. food comes out, hers is last (of course, thanks universe) and she immediately says (more like yells at me) her mac n cheese is ice cold, so i apologize and tell her i’ll be right out with a new one. while i’m in the back, watching them make a brand new mac n cheese from scratch, i sent my manager to the table because i just know this lady is going to complain. this guy is the sweetest guy, he’s an older guy who is a stickler on the rules but treats us all like we are his own children. he helped me with my taxes last year. anyways, he goes out there to talk to them and this ladies son literally stands up and stares him down!!! she tells him she wants a baked potato and he leaves. about the same time i come out with new mac n cheese. 

i get a dirty look from her and she says i want a baked potato. i told your manager. i apologize and say well if you or anyone else wants the extra mac n cheese feel free ! and i continue down the table making my rounds. she yells down the table, “this is still cold.” i said, “is it really? i had them make a brand new batch for you, so it shouldn’t be, i’m sorry!” and. she. literally. goes. “are you calling me a liar? because it sounds like you’re calling me a fucking liar.” i couldn’t even respond. i think i just said i’m not calling you a liar. 

it was at this point that i decided this lady was not worth the tip that i already know i’m not gonna get from her. she complained about everything and then flagged my manager down when she didn’t get a discount. they gave her 20% off only her entree. no tip. exact change.

the best part about this was after she accused me of calling her a liar, i kept doing what i was doing and being smiley and friendly to the other guests (who were mostly all nice and tipped me on their own bills, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and i heard someone sitting near her go “it’s not even really cold” to her. honestly lady, i’m not calling you a liar, but if the shoe fucking fits...

maybe not the most exciting story, but i just really can’t believe the way some people act towards others. especially while they are working. i once got a complaint because i was stocking up for the day as a bartender, and someone complained about me “just standing there, picking mint, like i’m not even aware of my surroundings”. my manager talked to me about it and said he couldn’t believe it, because i had up-sold them a bunch so i had to be paying attention. 🙃 whenever i do the mint now, i joke that i’m risking my job.

789,i punched out the neighbour..,"after my last story about putting the bar on fire, i thought this one was appropriate. 

&amp;#x200b;

so again, this was a few years ago. i was working in a bar in a small town with around 10000 people. there were a few bars around, and the bar i started working at was one of them. small, and the only people who would come in were regulars that came for a drink after work. usually around 12pm the place would have died out and we would close. the regulars would keep an eye on the bar while you were doing some things in the back or were occupied with other things as you were always alone. 

&amp;#x200b;

so at the back of the bar, we had a garage where we would keep the trash. the back of the bar also had a huge garage door with some glass panels (one of those where you can park your car, so the door moved up). we used this space to keep the trash till trash collection day came. trash collection was always on a monday, and i would always bring the trash out around 11, as the trashman came around 1 in the evening and by this time i usually had 2 or 3 regulars watching over the bar while i moved the trash out. my neighbour knew my routine as he owned a bar on the other side of the garage and was able to look from behind the bar into the garage to see if the lights in the garage were on or not. 

&amp;#x200b;

so one night i looked at the clock. it was around 11, and i told my regulars that i was sorry, but that i was going to move out the trash. i filled up their beers and said i'd be back shortly. i emptied the trashbins behind the bar and moved to the garage. i put the bags in front of the door and as i opened the huge door a black hooded figure came running in while screaming. i was shocked and pulled down the door as fast and hard as i could. i hit him right on the head! spot on! i giggled and said; that's what you get. i was trembling and moved towards the figure while trying to sign across the street for some help from the bar on the other side. no one behind the bar.. that's strange.. 

&amp;#x200b;

i stood there for a few seconds till i heard moaning and recognized the voice. i moved closer to the figure laying there on the floor and realized that it actually was the owner of the bar across the street. after a minute or so he managed to sit up with me next to him profoundly apologizing. he stared at me and told me; ""damn girl.. i just wanted to make a joke, but you got me good. you did good though. that's how you should react."" and without saying another word he stumbled back to his bar. 

&amp;#x200b;

after this i got the trash out (still completely in shock), closed the garage door and went back inside telling my regulars i was closing early and we were moving to the neighbours bar to see how he was doing. after hearing the story they agreed and we managed to laugh about it all together in the end. but i don't think he's tried to joke with anyone like that after.

tl;dr: accidentally punched out my neighbour with a garage door after he tried to scare me as a joke. ",CaveFlavored,tfys
790,"when customers touch you, how do you react?","i’m having some anxiety over this because i feel bad. this guy apparently didn’t want a glass for his beer (we give them by default, chilled) and was trying to slip it back onto my tray while i was still putting down drinks for the table. i was caught off guard and almost dropped it and said a polite “oops! pardon me!” in a bit of a silly tone. but then as a joke or to tease, he pressed the glass on my arm and asked if it was cold. i froze and didn’t say anything and he asked again. i’ll admit my tone was a little firm when all i could get out was “pardon me..” the guy looked embarrassed.

791,chihuahua lady,"i work in a pretty small cafe that likes to think it is a restaurant in the evenings. we are so small that the majority of your shift is alone on the bar whilst the chef works 5 metres away from you in an open plan customers see everything sort of way. 

today at about 3pm a table comes in and directly walks over to our 2 reserved tables we have in a small lounge area at the back of the cafe. we normally keep them reserved until we are full or a larger group needs it, this purely a practicality considering how tiny we are (full is 13 tables max). i went over very cheery and i directed them to our nice table by the window with lots of light and space. they seemed rather annoyed and i could already tell this was going to be an 'entitled' table. 
i went over with the menus, told them the specials and made up a large cappuccino for one of the ladies who wanted it fast. i go back to the table and put the cappuccino down and immediately get snapped at for more sugar. 'no worries, anything else i can get you?' 'mint tea and a hot chocolate, perfect.' 

i reach over for the menu and suddenly a fucking tiny aggressive chihuahua jumps onto the table and starts yapping aggressively at me. i was totally shocked and a little scared to be honest. i just wasn't expecting it. plus the owner just casually picked it up and covered its mouth to stop it barking i leave the menu on the table in shock and go get their drinks.

new customers are arriving and everytime the door opens the thing starts it's crazy yapping without a single stern 'no' or an attempt to stop it. i take their drinks over and the chihuahua starts it barking again as i put the drinks down. i ask again if there is anything else i can get them and the lady with the chihuahua asks if we still serve breakfast, i point out that no, we stop breakfast at 11:30 as per the menu for the reason that our kitchen is too small for both lunch and breakfast at the same time. she rolls her eyes, flicks a couple of pages back and forth then slams the menu closed and declares that she will eat nothing as we have nothing tasty on our menu. 

the 2 hours this table is in our cafe all they have are 3 drinks for the whole table and a brownie. meanwhile the yappy little dog continued to bark at any unsuspecting victim who dared come into our cafe for lunch and the best fresh made sandwiches in our town.  

needless to say i did not go back over to that table and when my colleague arrived to take over at the end of my shift she did the exact same thing with the menu again allowing her chihuahua to yap at my colleague too. 

this is the worst type of person.

tldr: lady is super rude and let's her aggressive chihuahua yap at me, my colleague and other guests for over 2 hours.

793,lady called me a cunt for getting one taco from the ala carte menu.,"i was new to being a server after being a host for nearly a year at the same restaurant. so i was still getting the hang of waiting tables, but at that point i knew the menu and the restaurant pretty well. 

had a couple of women come in on a slower night. i had about three tables, so another table wasn’t really a big problem for me. one lady orders an enchilada plate and the other orders a taco from the ala carte menu. both got waters. easy peasy.

time passes, i bring them their food, go do some side work and check on my other tables. then i hear a “hey” coming from table 40. it’s the two ladies. i’m still new at this, so i’m terrified, but i approach the table and say “hi, what can i help you with?”

the lady with the taco had picked up a menu from the host stand, points and says “why did you only bring me one taco?”

“oh! you ordered a taco fritos from the ala carte menu. that is only one taco. i can get you another if you’d like, they take no time at all.”

“but it says ‘fritos’ with an ‘s’. so that means more than one.”

“oh. no i’m sorry. the ala carte menu only means one... but i mean it, if you want another, i’ll get it in right now.” at this point i’m panicking.

“i’m not paying extra for what i should have got in the first fucking place. just get me a box and your manager.”

fuck. as i’m going to find my manager, i’m literally tearing up and shaking. i know i didn’t do anything wrong, but i was so freaked out. our gm was relatively new, and i hadn’t worked with him much prior to this night, so i didn’t know how he would react. i go find him smoking, and tell him what’s up. he looks frustrated but proceeds to the dining room to talk to the woman. i can’t hear what’s going on, but i can see things heating up from afar until i see the lady scream “are you fucking serious” to my manager, as he grabs the box and heads to a computer around the corner. i ask him what’s up and he basically says the lady sucks and that he’s just gonna void the taco to make her go away, when he opens the box to see that the lady hid two of our ramekins in her box along with her half eaten taco. he laughs and tells me to just bring the check. 

when i return to the table, with my manager flanking me with the ramekins, the lady asks why she has to pay. as i’m stuttering, my manager says, “if you were going to try and steal these from us, the least you can do is pay for the one taco.” and he walks away. 

after i ring their cards and come back, i say “have a good evening ladies. thank you for coming in.” even though i hope they didn’t. and then the taco lady says “you should be ashamed of yourself for working here, you cunt. i am never coming back.” her mortified friend left me a $20 bill and they left.

tbh i’ve been working there for 5 years now and have not seen her face again. so imma call that an accomplishment. ",km12494,tfys
794,the time my boss went insane for a night,"i worked at a non-chain tex-mex restaurant where the owner is also the head chef/cook. he's a pretty cool guy, always understanding of situations and circumstances n such. that, however, changed on this day.


he brought us into the kitchen all at once when everyone on shift showed up. at first, we thought people were being let go or someone had died but nah. he tells us that his fiance's family is having dinner here tonight and he wants everything to be nothing short than perfect. it was probably the most serious we've ever seen him and we knew this night meant a lot to him. he told us to report anything we overheard or got told by the table for feedback as well.


i go wait for the table and get a feel for the future in-laws. dad in-law is one of those super-serious looking business dudes while his kids and grandkids look like kids and grandkids; wife is wife. they order drinks, i bring them along with the chips n salsa. dad in-law takes a sip of his cocktail and says ""too fruity"" with a sour expression.


i give the table time to decide and go back and tell boss man about dad in-law's comment. he drops his utensils, goes into the fridge and yells ""burn the fruit"" before coming back to finish the plate.


i'm shook but return to the table. i wrote down the orders, to which dad in-law comments about the name of his plate; saying ""it's a silly name"" (one of ""those"" places). i tell boss man and he addresses the kitchen about who named the dish. after a few seconds of silence, a line cook speaks up and says ""you did, sir."" boss man looks at his reflection on the counter top and says ""you're fired"" before rushing to get the order started.


fast forward to getting the food out. the recently fired boss man is staring me down from the kitchen as if i was born to fuck this up, which makes me even more nervous. the food is served with no problems. boss man is a train wreck of nerves as time ticks by to the end of the meal.


i show up to do the mid-meal ""how's the food"" check and dad in-law says his quesadillas are burnt at the bottom. i ask if he wants a new plate but says it's fine and continues eating. i reluctantly tell boss man and he fucking snaps. he tells a line cook to take over for him and walks out the backdoor. the available wait staff that's concerned for him follows him out. they come back in a few minutes saying they're taking him to er.


&gt;oh fuck why


they told us he was punching the dumpster hard enough for the skin to scrape off his knuckles. i'm full of fuck and the line cooks take over the rest of the evening completely. dad in-law eventually wants to speak to the manager to tell him the food was wonderful. he most likely knew that his daughter told boss man about tonight and knew that he would be on edge, so he was just busting his chops.


boss man ended up being out for almost a month because he fractured some bones in fingers. he came back happy as a clam though.

796,this hot dog isn't burnt,"half server, half cook story. i was both.

when i was a kid still in single digit age i started to work for the family catering company. during the summer months we had the concession contract for a major music venue and the summer after i turned 16 i was put on the grill station: burgers, dogs, kielbasa, fried chicken (which is how i got my tic tac toe scar). people would walk up to my station, i'd prepare their food as they liked while they browsed the slaw, potato salad, drinks, cookies, coffee, then come back for their meat. there was also a full service patio restaurant, and i would also serve the private and corporate tent parties, where i learned how to bullseye targets with bottle corks.

a guy asked me to burn his wife's hot dog. i took this to mean very well done, so i gave it an extra minute, put it in the box and handed it over.

two minutes later he was back, complaining that the dog wasn't burnt. it had no black. it didn't crunch. could i please cook it correctly?

so i took a new dog and put it under the grill on top of the ceramic tiles, directly in one of the gas jets. it turned black and crunchy. he was happy.

from then on every time i saw him walk in the door i would immediate put a dog in the flame and his wife (who i never saw once) seemed to be happy.",RemorsefulSurvivor,tfys
797,"""there's raw fish on my rainbow roll!""","my first job ever was a server when i was 16. i enjoyed it so much, i always stuck with a server job until i graduated nursing school much later. out of all those years of serving, this is the story that stuck out most.

my family moved to california when i was 17 and i needed a new job. i saw a 'help wanted' sign at a local japanese restaurant and thought why the hell not since i loved japanese food. it was a small restaurant but had a sushi bar. most people ordered sushi as opposed to the chicken teriyaki or bento boxes. 

it was my first week on the job. two older gentlemen come in, they are both white males roughly in their 50s or so.  they were nice and i even remember joking with them. i hand them their menus and come back in a few minutes to take their order. one of the men looks to our special menu that's posted on the side of our walls and says, ""that rainbow roll sounds great. i'll take that!"" rainbow rolls are pretty much synonymous everywhere. it's generally a california roll topped with several kinds of fish.  i jot it down and the other gentlemen proceeds to order another roll, i can't remember which to this day but it's really inconsequential. their order comes up and i serve it to them, they smile and say 'thank you.' i walk away and busy myself with other things while they eat. about 5 minutes later, i see them calling me to the table. i arrive to their table side and notice the first man is beet red, almost trembling with anger. i'm almost scared to ask but i say, ""is everything alright, sir?"" the man looks me straight in the eyes and says, ""there is raw fish on my rainbow roll!!"" at this point i don't really know what to say, i've never encountered anyone that didn't know that sushi for the most part, had raw fish. i was taken aback but explained, ""well sir, almost all our sushi rolls have raw fish in them, that's just how it's prepared and served."" he shoves his plate forward and says, ""well i'm not eating that! that's disgusting!!"" i take the plate back and notice how his friend is just quietly eating his roll while this is going on. not sure if he was embarrassed or just didn't care.

799,i got fired because a customer look my joke wrong,"it’s no big deal as i only had 2 days left before leaving for a new job, but damn. 

i got word yesterday from gossip i was fired, and was in the dark until a server actually called me. my very first table from last friday night had been very iffy with me and upset because their food was taking about 30 minutes to come out, it was a table of 6. after i placed their food on the table an older man looked at me and (i thought!) jokingly said “well i want to speak with your manager”. the table laughed at him so i smiled and in the lightest/softest teasing voice i could said something along the lines of “well i’m sorry he’s not in tonight so you can’t, but you’ve got me!” he then very harshly said he didn’t want to talk to me and i bit my tongue, asked everyone if they were okay, and walked away. we quickly got busy and i continued to check on them and run my other tables. they tipped me 20% and left, i thought nothing of it. 

apparently that man talked to my boss and in his words, i “rudely told him he wasn’t allowed to speak to a manager and he had to speak to me”. without asking me, my boss chose to fire me-by having another server call me! i haven’t spoken to my boss since, this was 2 days ago. isn’t that some shit? a miscommunication and a soured old man and a server gets fired. absolutely insane. lost any respect for my former boss in the process.

800,"bleeding head wound? no worries, gotta get my daughter.","i posted in r/talesfromretail before with another story but after i saw in some comments that this subreddit existed, i figured any other stories i have would better fit here. 

so i work at a place whose slogan has something to do with 'having the meats', we'll call it kitty's. we're across the parking lot from a wally world so we get characters and have strange events here, but this one was a doozy. some backstory: i had my malformed uterus removed in december of 2018, and since the incision sites kept opening a bit while i slept, the nurses sent me home with some gauze and medical tape along with some other stuff. i've healed up fine, but i decided to make a little first aid kit to keep in the car with the supplies just in case. so now, it's mid february and i'm working at kitty's, making sammiches and the like. we had someone shoot up in the bathroom again so i had taken a break from drive thru to take out the trash in there (we did this in case they left the syringe in the trash as some people liked to push the trash down trying to be helpful, and also so customers weren't freaked out by *bloody paper towels* in the trash). we decide i should take out the trash in lobby too since they're getting pretty full and also there were work gloves and a pair of rolled up pants in one (we figured it was our good friend the druggies). however, as i'm about to put a fresh bag into the second out of the three cans, a lady walks up to me all freaked out, saying something about the parking lot and a paper bag. i'm confused because i've never seen anyone freaked out over litter.

then another woman comes up saying a man has fallen and needs help and he's bleeding everywhere. my coworker, billy bob (bb), saw everything and was already out there when i ran out. i was already wearing rubber gloves and as soon as i saw the blood and understood the situation, i announce i have gauze and run to my car and get my first aid kit. i know i maybe should've changed gloves but i was freaking out a bit. there was a lot of blood. i try to stop the bleeding while bb goes to get the manager in charge who calls for paramedics. the man was an elderly man (om), not the oldest we've gotten but up there. he keeps  telling us he doesn't have time for this, his daughter is about to be out of therapy and he needs to go pick her up. the two ladies from before and i offer to go get her but om doesn't remember the exact address or phone number of the place. bb comes out with gloves on and holds the gauze on om's head while i get some wet paper towels to clean the blood off of om's hands. apparently, om had to use the restroom while on his way to get his daughter, so he wanted to stop in to ours but fell when he went to get his walker out of the trunk. manager helps him go to the bathroom and he comes out to put his walker back. we ask him to please stay and his daughter will probably understand him being late to get them. by now i'd thrown away the bloody gauze and paper towels and i notice he has dried blood on his nose and ask if i can at least clean that off before he goes.

nope! he refuses more help, though we do help put his walker in the trunk. the fire truck with the paramedics finally arrive, lights off and moseying on into the parking lot. they get out just as om is backing out despite our protests and fears he might have a concussion so driving wouldn't be safe even though we'd stopped the bleeding. they try to ask him to stop and ask how he is, but he starts speeding off, nearly hitting one of the paramedics. we ask if there's anything they could've done to stop him and they say no, and leave. we clean the blood off the asphalt, give free shakes to the families of the ladies who helped, and just continued on working. both me and bb were sad we couldn't help more, and also frustrated, but we did our best. we were mostly shocked and incredulous that he was fine going to pick up his daughter with a bloody face. i figure she'd be more freaked out and telling him he should've gotten help, but nothing to do now. i got a free sammich out of it since i used my own materials at least.",Naitohana,tfys
801,cousin quit after manager lied to deny her a promotion.,"so i wrote a post earlier about this chain restaurant i worked out and how i quit because a few of the servers started messing with my ability to make money and do my job. this is a story of my cousin who i worked with at the same restaurant. 

&amp;#x200b;

so my cousin was hired to work for this place first and later suggested i work with her and agreed. it was a decent place and over all management was really cool, the worst thing about it management was that they tended to use my cousin and i as examples for how you should look and act while working there (this made those few coworkers hate me more as well as my cousin) well anyway my cousin started working there as a togo girl and she was really good at her job (i couldn't even do that job very well) to go was very paced and very demanding and more often than not you don't get tipped for doing it. she was really good about getting everyone the correct food on time and making sure they left happy if there was ever an issue, now she worked with this one girl regularly who didn't give a damn about her job (let's call her b) b would constantly hide under the to go counter to play on her phone, try and give herself more of the tips despite doing almost no work, she was really slow when putting orders together and if she felt a customer was rude to her she'd quickly catch an attitude with them and she always had to leave early or arrive late cause of her kids (i'm not saying that doesn't happen to be with kids but it happened way to much and was a very obvious excuse she used to get her way) 

&amp;#x200b;

at this point was cousin is fed up, she is tired of being forced to split her tips with b and wants the opportunity to make her own money serving tables (mind she has served before) so she talks to the gm about being promoted and the gm agrees and tells her that she has to have two other managers give him reviews on her and then she can start working as a server. so of course she goes to the two managers she works the most with, the togo/hostess manager and the kitchen manager. the kitchen manager leaves her a glowing review and says she'd be an amazing server. the togo manager however blantly lies claims she is super lazy, shows up late, calls out all the time, and is really slow so she isn't ready to be a server yet. 

at first my cousin has no knowledge of the reviews and she was denied being promoted and couldn't figure out why finally after a really hard day of dealing with b she goes to the gm and asks why she was denied promotion he show's her the togo managers review and she gets beet red but calmly leaves his office to finish her shift, she calls my that night in tears ranting about what happened and of course i side with her. the next day she confronts the togo manager who flat out tells her ""sorry but you're just so good at togo i can't afford to lose you here so i had to make sure you wouldn't get promoted"" the next day my cousin turns in her 2 weeks notice and finishes the job without another incident however the gm did call her several times trying to convince her to stay and come back to work for them he even fired the togo manager when he found out that she had lied. needless to say my cousin didn't go back and is now working some where else.

802,nightmare table challenges me on my first night as supervisor.,"this is going to be a long one, so quick warning and i will leave a tl;dr at the bottom. 

i work at a local restaurant in a smaller city. it’s one of the more nicer restaurants in town but it’s not super fancy. it’s friday night and we got just slammed with customers, it was national margarita day. we’re incredibly short staffed because we weren’t expecting such a huge rush. 

that night was my first official night as a supervisor, i was really excited. 

i get a table with a nice looking couple, she’s wearing this incredibly fake looking sparkly engagement ring. i comment on it to make conversation tell her it’s pretty and congratulations. they then tell me that they had to get it resized recently for her. (seems like an insignificant detail but it comes back i swear).  i didn’t get to spend a ton of more time with the table because i had other tables to service. 

they ordered apps and both got a steak dinner (we bring dinner salads out before our steak dinners). i quickly realize that i timed my dinner salads wrong so i needed to bring them out with their dinners. unfortunate error for sure. 

as i’m bringing out their salads miss fake ass ring meets me halfway across the restaurant and says “i need to talk to a manager rigbt now” yelling. she’s yelling this. so i tell her i will grab her a manager. now here’s wear it gets really sticky. i don’t have a manager in the building so i have to put on my supervisor cap walk back to the table and tell her i’m the person she can talk to. 

so i’ll just list all the things she went off on 

received the wrong bottle of wine 
got her app too late 
her dishes were cold
she didn’t get her salad 

she’s like crying at the point. just being so dramatic about the whole thing while her poor fiancée is sitting there quietly eating his “cold” meal. first off they ordered the wrong bottle of wine so i talked them through our menu and got them a new one. she had her appetizer for maybe 10 minutes before her meal. i remember specifically that i took the dishes out of the cooks hands and brought them to her table. i’ll give her the salad complaint. that’s my bad. 

she starts going on and on about how she wanted to have a nice night and now it’s just totally ruined. she didn’t want anything i offered her ( the usual; gift card, free dessert, discounted bottle of wine). 

finally the owner of the restaurant shows up. i fill her in on the situation she tells me to 100% her whole ticket that she’ll talk to her. so i have no more interaction with that table (thank god). 

night ends a couple days go by and i got a chance to talk to the owner about what happened. trying to explain that she was a nightmare and i wasn’t a horrible server. she then tells me that she recognized the girl at the table and that she will bring in a new guy every time and spin the same story about just getting engaged and will try to cry her way into a free meal. my investigative skills led me to find on her facebook that she’s done this to at least half of the other restaurants in town. she’s now now no longer allowed in our establishment. 


tl;dr 
bitch comes in complains about everything, wont take a gift card or free dessert and just wants everything taken off her bill. we learn later she’s actually a scammer and does this to restaurants around town.

803,beyond sick of door dash,"so about a month or two ago our owner spent nearly an hour between phone calls contacting door dash to get us taken down from their website. i was elated! no more horrible phone calls, no indignant drivers hassling me, and certainly no customers complaining about how horrible our nonexistent delivery service treated them! such a peaceful time, i remember it fondly. 

today i swear i beetlejuiced this call into existence. i was training our new bartender and was over joyed to pronounce that we do not deliver and our lovely owner had gone through the trouble of ensuring we never spoke of door dash again. ha. oh how wrong i was. not even an hour later i get the call. if you've dealt with these insidious humans you know how it goes. like pulling teeth. they had to call back twice because surprise surprise they don't have any correct or up to date info regarding our menu. i thought maybe i'm wrong and put the order through. 

spoiler alert! i was not wrong. not even ten minutes pass before our driver is in. i know the drivers aren't the problem here truly. if you're reading this door dash driver i am so sorry i was short and came off rude but this really irks my last nerve. there is no reason i should even be doing this order. 

door dash makes it incredibly difficult to contact them and i remember just how hard it was the last time owner had to have this conversation with the company. knowing all this i tell the driver that the food won't be leaving the building until door dash calls me to discuss that this would be their last order.

this fucking company doesn't even give the drivers a phone number! this lady has to sit there sending text messages and they let this stand off go on for 10 minutes before i get the ring on the bar phone from them. as soon as i know it's door dash i sling the to go bag over the bar and give the driver a ""thanks bye"" wave. the woman on the phone is beyond fucking rude to me and berating me for ""holding the order hostage"". maybe if door dash gave one single fuck about their workers or business or anyone this wouldn't be an issue. they give me another number i'm supposed to call to request to be taken down (again) and the lady is nothing short of nasty to me when i tell her that they need to be making a note that this isn't happening anymore. 

i'm sick of it! i'm done being nice. i gave the number over to my manager but i don't think he sees any value in contacting the company any more over it. we're just going to be asking suspicious to go orders straight up if they're door dash and declining these orders. i just hate this company so much. i happily bend over backwards all shift long to take care of my customers! for these people to masquerade as if they're a part of our business and treat me like shit while peddling our product churns my fucking stomach. fuck door dash.

later, i applied for the call center position at this company, and then was told by the interviewer that my boss called me ""unreliable"".

needless to say, i was shocked.
not to toot my own horn, but i was one of the best employees. i knew how to do all the front end stuff, could open by myself (had to on few occasions), and was always on time.

i confronted him about it, and he uses the fact that i had those nights off against me. i yelled at him, reminding him that he agreed to it. he just kind of looked at me and shrugged it off.

i found a new job, and put in my 2 weeks. 
he made my last day hell. 
i was doing deliveries that day, and typically, the driver that opens is the first one to go on break after the lunch rush. 
not today.
he sends the other driver on break who has only been there for maybe an hour or two.
i ask him for my break, and he tells me to wait.

i order food while on shift because i'm starving and can't stop as orders are coming in. 
i had to take a moment between deliveries to eat.

i never saw my break.
i worked for 10 hours straight.

i heard he got fired for hiring someone with a bad driving record some time later. that was good to hear. ",SuzieGR,tfys
809,i’m a millionaire-i can fix my mistakes,"several years ago i was serving at one of our fair cities finer dining restaurants. an eight top was sat and as i was greeting them, the dad interrupts me and orders a bottle of wine. that’s fine, i’m used to it. i pour the taste for him when i return and he approves. when i go to serve the his wife before anyone else, he stops me and says, “no, pour me the neck, it’s the best part.” sure thing. everything’s going great with the rest of the table, his family is lovely. during service, he’s a little curt, makes some smarmy comments about me not going to college (i did) and being overall a total ass, but not what i would quantify as terribly rude. . yet. after the wine is gone, he asks for a bud light. i tell him we don’t have bud light, but, we have beer a that is comparable for this reason, beer b which i think you’d like for this reason and beer c- “alright, shut up, shut up, i’ll take that.” i’m pretty thick skinned and can keep my mouth shut when i need to, but do not appreciate being told to shut up. i think i wore it on my face. when i came back with the beer, his daughters had clearly said something to him, as he apologized for his behavior and went to shake my hand. when he did, he did that little finger tickling against my palm thing. i told him i found him incredibly rude, and while i wouldn’t let their service, or the rest of the guests (who wore “here we go” expressions) service suffer, i wouldn’t be communicating with him for the rest of the night. rest of the service goes by relatively uneventfully, he barks when he needs another beer, i get another beer without addressing him, i drop check, run card and go to the end of the bar to wait for them to leave so i don’t have to interact with him anymore. he saunters on up, and i do my best to ignore him, but he opens that big dumb mush of his and says “you know; some men can’t admit their mistakes. some men can’t pay for their mistakes. but, i can. i’m a millionaire, and i’d like to apologize!” he then proceeds to hand me a crisp $100 bill before promptly asking for his $77 change. my dignity was worth $23 to him.",yourkindofhero,tfys

me: your uncomfortable server

 i came in at 3 to relieve a bar server, the bar is empty aside from these two men(mid60s). the morning server wants to head out but they haven’t cashed out. she let’s them know she’s headed out and if they want to cash out, or that i can finish up taking care of them. 

they tab out with her, but seem like they’re still having drinks(they had racked up a 120$ tab with the previous server, mainly on drinks). so i head over and introduce myself, the typical if i can get you anything else just let me know! and here’s where it begins... and ends. 

om1: i like your glasses! 

me: thank you! 

om1: you know he’s actually an ophthalmologist *points to om2* 

om2: well actually, it depends what time of day it is. at night i’m a gynecologist. *winks* 

they’re both having a good laugh, while myself (20f) put on the customer laugh and slowly walk away. 

it may not seem like much, but it was enough to give me and coworkers a good gasp and cringe. safe to say i did not return to their table, nor have i seen them again. ",Taytaynowayheyhey,tfys
811,"my new job does not allow you to ask off, ever, for any reason, and no matter how far in advance it is. am i being over dramatic, or is this completely unreasonable?","for context, i'm not talking about a party i want to go to next week.  i'm talking about planning a vacation, concert tickets, etc. months from now.  

i was told i need to find people to cover my shift(s) if i need off.  which is generally fine.  but i have no idea what my schedule is going to even be in july, august, etc.

they told me to wait until the schedule comes out and do your best, and if you can't find someone to cover your shifts we might be able to figure something out.

but at the same time, i'm dropping a lot of money on things i may or may not get to go to if that's your policy. it's not like i can just drop plane tickets and commitments to family and friends because i was scheduled that week.

812,don't judge a book by its cover,"backstory for setting- 

i work at a semi-fine dining daily fresh oysters &amp; steak house (wet and dry aged steaks). 

attire for restaurant: casual to formal (important for later)

median salary to dine: $80k

table sales: $1,943

time: last night. 

host of party: some vp for tech company, will be calling as- dude. 

while i did take the 9 top for myself, the bartender took tables on the floor since she wasn't making jack shit lol. 

&amp;#x200b;

tdlr: served a guest and his party 2 hours of the night and made my money off them despite having questions asked left and right.

\--

last night was one of those super slow days with a 9 top on the books- i was going to hustle the crap out of this table and get everything i can from them. 6pm rolls in and the party slowly trickles in one after another. 6:10ish, every has sat and have been watered. 

as i was going into my introduction (i don't read the menu, i just give them suggestions from each selection, since i'm someone that gets the table to order what i want them to do) the host, some vp, was very rude. off the bat, i can tell this table weren't government officials or attorney office- also noted that they probably worked in some it company. their attire were slacks and tucked in dri-fit golf shirts and tucked in ralph lauren polos. 

so any who, the dude kept interrupting and told me to 'hush' after explaining what we're 86 of (out of) and going into the al a carte menu. so i complied, and got everyones alcohol orders and the dude wanted blantons on the rocks, which we were out of since our owner was dumb and never buys them in boxes. i had offered an alternative, mitkers rye 10yr or even whistle pig, which luckily he got the mitkers 10yr. 

so for appetizers they ordered 4 dozen oysters which i was glad cause that put their total bill including alcohol around $400 with no entre orders. as i was delivering their oysters, the dude was just straight up persistent in asking questions (which i don't mind) but it got annoying lol. questions would range from: ""cocktail/horseradish fresh? when did you guys get these oysters, how briny are these, etc"" . 

after crumbing their table and receiving their entre orders (thankfully the dude wasn't persistent with questions) they had ordered everything i wanted that table to order. to share with the table they had ordered 3 orders of dry age porterhouse, 4 dry age cowboy's, 3 dry age kansas, and 2 scallops for the ladies. they also ordered a couple of veggies to share with the table, and had ordered 2 bottles of silver oak napa valley ($213 per) &amp; opus one ($420). 

i honestly just think the dude was hangry lol so i pardoned his behavior because after all the food was eaten, he was super polite and actually a really cool dude! as i was clearing off their table the dude, i shit you not, asked me to put a 25% auto grat since they all enjoyed their meals and my service. 

on a slow tuesday night, i had made $485.75 in tips and the best part was when the dude had given me the last pour of the opus one to try, and holy cow- tastes pretty good in my opinion! 

i do want to reiterate, i was only going to do a 20% grat on them and inform them, but the dude insisted 25%.",dnam15,tfys
813,coworkers hated me for being good at my job.,"so there isn't a lot to this story but for some context i'm the kind of person that if i'm working at a job i'm there to work and make my money. let me clarify that i am not against having friends on the job by any means but i am also not going to spend my days goofing off with people when i should be working. 

&amp;#x200b;

anyway. i started this job working for this chain restaurant, before then i had worked at a semi-fine dining restaurant so i i was used to strict rules on appearance and manners. i was hired as a bartender but they wanted me to start working as a server first to really get to know the menu and policies which is totally understandable. as per usual i started off with two tables and i had been serving for several years at this point so i new the basics of the service industry. in my first two weeks i was the top sales person because i know how to get people to order what you want them to buy and by the next week they went ahead and promoted me to bartender and began my training. my coworkers hated me for this. they were pissed that a ""new server"" was promoted instead of a veteran and even more pissed that  i was constantly the top ranked server in sales and i made good tips. they started going out of their way to mess with my tips and service. they refused to help if i ended up in the weeds the tipped bussers and hostess under the table to keep them from seating me and cleaning off my tables so i took matters into my own hands. 

i started going up to the host stand and seating my own tables when i noticed the other servers doing this, i also cleaned off my own tables all the time and in fact got even bigger tips from tables noticing that i was a harder worker. i also reported my coworkers behavior to my manager because you don't mess with someone's source of income. my basic rule is you don't have to like me you just have to work with me. i ended up quitting despite the money because i was tired of having my money messed with. i should also clarify it wasn't like the entire staff against me and i made a few friends there that i am still friends with today. it was a small group of our laziest workers who legitmately (they said this to my face) assumed i was doing so good simply because i was white and that i didn't really need the money because i am married. 

 tl;dr: coworkers pay bussers and hostesses not to seat or clean my tables because i was doing good in sales and tips and was promoted but didn't deserve it because i am white and married. ",Lil4Lyfe,tfys
814,the greatest complaint,"so. guest retention is kind of my jam. but i've outdone myself. i absolutely have to share.

we had a powercut and it fucked our systems for a bit after.

i told a couple of older ladies (you no doubt know the kind) that i'd come find them when i could sell food and take payments again. i forgot them.

anyway, they were already mad, but i was winning them back with my shit eating grin. or so i thought.

i check their meals, apparently there's too much black pepper. there's not meant to be pepper in this dish. i inspect it hard af, coz that's a major fuck up.

... our bowls pattern involves black spots. that's what she was mad at. they aren't flavoured spots, just if you wondered.

anyway, bit later i take them the bill on a sideplate i absolutely loaded with peppercorns. they tipped over a third of their meals",noob_almost,tfys
815,older woman screamed at me because there was an apple stem in her fuji apple salad,"this happened in 2010 at a panera in illinois. i was working there part time throughout college. i worked the registers as well as worked on the sandwich line. this particular evening i was working the bakery register, which took mostly bagel and desert orders but occasionally full meal orders if the lines got backed up.

for those that have never been, panera is a fast casual restaurant chain that serves coffee, bagels, baked goods, sandwiches, soups, and salads. it's basically in between fast food and casual full service restaurants. at the time we were required to wear green aprons with tan hats. managers, however, only wore polos and khakis with no hats or aprons. i was wearing my usual hat sitting on top of my afro (admittedly it was way too long for food service) and my apron like normal.

on this evening i was on the bakery registers, it was a very busy saturday night. it was right during the rush hour as well, so as the only person in bakery making coffee drinks, slicing baker's dozens bagels people would take home for breakfast, serving desserts etc. i wasn't completely focused on the short, older woman that appeared in front of my register.

when i notice her standing there, she is giving me a death stare with furious eyes. she points to her the middle of her salad and loudly says ""what the hell is this in my f-ing salad?""

now i hadn't taken this woman's order, i hadn't made her order, i didn't even know anything about what she ordered. it was my first time seeing her at all. i peered over the edge of the bowl and saw what looked like an inch long, brown apple stem. i see the apples in her salad so i knew it was the fuji apple salad. so i say ""umm, it looks like its just an apple stem. i can have them make you a new salad."" 

her response was to start screaming at me about how whats in her salad is disgusting, that i personally should be ashamed, how could i sit there and tell her it's just an apple stem and that its a big health risk. most of the restaurant was staring at me like i had done something wrong, or at least it felt that way.

i said ""ma'am i'm really sorry that an apple stem is in your salad but i didn't make your food or take your order. i can replace the salad or get a manager for you.""

her response was to point her finger an inch from my face and she said ""no, i want you to know that this is unacceptable behavior!"".

i decided that i had taken enough crap, walked in the back to grab my manager and tell him i wasn't coming out of the back until she left. she was yelling something at me while i was walking to the back but i didn't listen to what she was saying, after the last thing she said i could tell she was nuts. i had worked there for 2 years already at this point so i knew i didn't have to take her crap, especially about something i had nothing to do with.

to this day i don't know why she chose me to scream at. i certainly didn't look like a manager or was dressed as one. sometimes i wonder if she thought somehow the apple stem was my hair or something.

816,you cant please everyone,"so a little back story about me and the place i work at. im a waitress and have been one for 3 years already and im quite alternative meaning i have a few piercings, stretched ears and colorfull hair but my boss never minded that so it was always all good plus the city i work in is known to tourists for being the city of artists so its not weird seeing all kind of people. 
so, this happened pretty recently and at this time of the year we dont have much work and as usal i was doing my job , serving tables, cleaning ,etc.. this too seemingy nice ladies come in and sit at a table, i come within seconds and take their order all while being polite and nice to them.i serve them their drinks and go sit on a high bar chair  (except them there was only one more table that already got their drinks) and after some time i see those two ladies coming towards me, thinking they want the bill  i walk towards the cash register and wait for them, as they arrive i greet them again and ask with a smile do they want to pay to which they reply yes , now as i was printing the bill one of the two ladies is looking at me with a look on her face that was not so pleasing. she asks me do i usually look like this , her eyes going all around me , now i am used to poeple making jokes about my stretched ears and stuff like that so i thought she was trying to do that but oh boy was i wrong , i replied still with a smile doing my best to stay polite that yes i usually look like this , lemme tell you she did not like the answer she began looking more disgusted towards me, she proceeded to ask if my father was the owner..at that point i realized shes dead serious and she thinks the only way someone like me can get a job is if we work for our parents , i started to get angry but i was not letting her see it i just politely said that my boss is not related to me and that im just a worker here. at this point other guests were coming and i wanted them to leave asap because i was loosin my patience with these ladies and i had better thigns to do than to discuss their disaproval of me, the lady gives me the money i hand here the change and as she was about to walk away she says that i dont fit in this job and that im not even polite to begin with. i freacking lost it at that point and just left them and went to serve other guests while shaking because i cant handle very well situations like that.
i know this is not the worse story in this subreddit but i really needed to vent somewhere because i felt bad for hours, im just trying to earn some money to go to college and im not a bad waitress, the fact that poeple like them can just bash you because they dont like you ( if it was my service id understand) and you cant even figth back because then you are the bad one.

817,christopher lee look a like has tee many martoonies,"not a server-but the gm. we had this older couple come in with some regularity up until 2 years ago. older, maybe late 60’s-early 70’s? she looked like a troll doll that a kid had drawn all over with a man orange marker that had been run over some black marker. he was a dead ringer for christopher lee. innocuous to the point of being unnoticeable except for their regular appearances, they usually ate dinner, drank 2 martinis each and bounced. well, sarumon was sneaky one night and ordered a third martini while his wife was in the bathroom. she comes back and calls him an “asshole”, kind of playfully, but, not really. alls well, doesn’t seem drunk, cool. about an hour later i’m talking to a table about wine with my back to the door and i hear a loud crash. count dooku is down for the count. i rush over to see what happened and he’s gushing blood. (when i looked at the security footage later, he had gone to tip our musician that night, knocked over his guitar, caught the coat rack and tumbled over, head straight through the glass pane in the door, forehead smacking against the frame.) i’m on top of lord summerisle with as many napkins as possible, telling chef to call an ambulance. we can see this guys skull. his wife runs over and says that “she’s a nurse”, “he’s been sneaking drinks at the yacht club all day” and “that won’t be necessary.” i insist, but, i can’t force the guy to stay and they leave before the ambulance comes. three martinis over a 2 1/2 + hour dinner with no visible signs of being drunk, so i really don’t think we over served. in the next couple of days i tell my staff that next time they come in, he’s allowed one drink and one drink only. and to come get me if he orders a second. of course, when they do come back a month later, they’re on the patio, surrounded by people, and my newest, youngest, greenest server is taking care of them. he order a second drink. i go to their table and as discretely as i possibly can, say something to the effect of “how are we tonight? so, i apologize, but, due to the incident last time, i’m only going to allow you to order one drink.” they both smile and she says “oh that’s so kind of you. i guess you recognize us. doesn’t that scar add character?” i think she thought i said i was buying a drink. i correct her and repeat. he asks if i’m serious and then does that little bye bye wave. cool, easy enough. i go to the host stand to see what the rest of the resos look like. here comes count dracula. “i need to speak to a manager.” “that’d be me, sir.” “are you the guy i just talked to?” (like 2 minutes ago?) “yes, sir, that’s me.” “i think you’re an asshole, i want to see the owner.” “sir, i am the owner.” well, i think you’re an asshole.” “sir, that’s fine but if you call me an asshole, again, you’re out.” “did you just call me an asshole?!??” “no, i...you know what? i’m going to ask you to leave. your checks on me” i go out to tell the wife, and she’s handing me a credit card, as i wave it away to explain the bills on me, he comes out and starts mother fucking me up and down in front of the whole patio. screaming about how this restaurant is going to be his, and my name is going to be destroyed in this city. that’s fine. he’s down the street in our little place still staring at me and mother fucking me. i’m cleaning up their table when the lady at the table next gets my attention and tells me i handled that very well and that the guys a huge prick and pulls all kinds of shit on other restaurants. never saw the man with the golden gun again, so, no. he didn’t end up owing the restaurant.

819,how i learned the rules on table reservations the hard way.,"first time poster. love this subreddit to death, although it works to my detriment; procrastination + reddit is a poisonous cocktail and a half. admittedly i don't have any stories as insane as some of the ones that i read on here, but it is the ultimate catharsis for a shitty day, and so i had to share one of my own.

so i work in a fairly small cafe; when this happened i had been working there about 5-6 months (only 2 shifts a week), so i was mostly settled in but there were a few rules i wasn't familiar with; one of these was not to take reservations on a saturday, as it was the busiest day of the week and there are only about 20 seats in the cafe. we don't get that many people asking for reservations and i don't normally answer the phone when people ring up asking, so it hadn't come up for me yet. but i quickly realised why the rule existed.

so this lady rings up; she asks to make a reservation for a table of 4; says they'll arrive in around 15 minutes. we're fairly busy at this point, and the only table available is one in the corner by the window; the seats are slightly less comfortable than the other ones admittedly, but it's a busy saturday so people don't normally mind. when i tell my supervisor, she isn't amazed and tells me we don't take reservations on saturdays and not to do it again, but we can't take it back so we'll just have to deal with it.

10 minutes pass, a group of 3 come in and ask if they can sit there; we tell them we're sorry but it's reserved.

another 5 minutes pass; she's not there.

25 minutes have passed now, another group of 3 come in and sit there; i go over and tell them we're sorry but the table is reserved. they aren't happy about it (understandably) and leave. pretty embarrassing for me.

now 40 minutes have passed and still no sign. a couple comes in and once more, we turn them away saying it's reserved. in retrospect, maybe we should have given up at that point and let them have the table, but i didn't want to break my word to the customer i spoke to and also didn't want to deal with her when she came in and didn't have a table.

turns out my concerns were worthless anyhow, because finally after 45 minutes, us having turned 3 tables away, she comes in, says she doesn't like the seats and leaves without a word of apology.

821,dominos order goes horribly wrong,"so i work at dominos pizza as a cashier and already you know we're going to be getting some crazy customers at a fast food restaurant such as the rude rich customers or the scruffy looking angry customers who had a bad day at work and want to take it off at a fast food worker.  this story happened only a year ago, but i gotta say it's probably the most explosive i've ever seen a customer get.

pretty much what was happening at the time was that there were reports of some stolen credit cards in the town that i was working in so our manager told both cashiers and drivers to check for credit card and i.d.  to make sure the name matched the card that they were paying with.  one night, a driver was delivering a large pizza to a woman who was already giving not only the cashiers a hard time but the driver as well, i told her about the credit card and i.d. and she was cool about it.  when he arrived at the house, he asked the woman for her i.d. and the card she was paying with  but of course, she did not want to give it even after he told her the reason as to why he had to check.  she started throwing all kinds of insults saying domino's sucks and our food always come to her cold and she'll be reporting him and to cancel her order.

when the driver came back, he told us what had happened and we didn't take much notice of it, the most we thought she'd do was call, cancel the order and that's it end of story.  not only a few minutes after he walks in the front door we get a call from her saying the driver was being rude, he had no right to ask for that and she demanded to speak to the manager.  so i pass the phone over to my manager and he took care of it from their.

(now this is where the customer starts to get petty and even more nastier)

at this specific dominos, the people who work here have unique names because they come from all different ethnicity and from different backgrounds, so when the manager told her the drivers name over the phone, that's when it pretty much hit the fan.

she threatened that she was coming to the store herself personally to speak to the manager face to face and hangs up the phone.

about 15 minutes before my shift ends and everything is slowing down on this night.  a tall, rather heavy set gentleman comes in.  he doesn't walk in slowly however, he throws the door open like he was trying to rip it off its hinges and speed walks straight up to me and says "" yeah, i wanna speak to the manager!""  i was caught off guard a little bit as i didn't remember taking this gentleman's order, but then i noticed a woman following him into the store looking like she owned the place and that's when i put two and two together.

she starts screaming and yelling for the manager, saying dominos sucks and she's a hardworking tax payer in america.  the manager comes over to find out what the commotion was and he knew exactly who this woman was.  it was the same woman who called earlier.

now at first she may have had some ground with the whole i.d. situation, but then that's when her ground started to crumble.

she loudly and proudly proclaimed she ""had"" to drag her husband to the store to defend herself and she had to leave her eight year old son at home with the front door unlock to talk to the manager which was.

so pretty much, she left her son home alone who wasn't even 10 yet and possibly asleep at this hour, with the front door practically ajar just to fight with a fast food restaurant.  so if anything were to happen to the kid, god forbid, i don't think she can pin the blame on dominos.

if things couldn't get any worse, she starts to make her way around the counter in order to get even closer to the manager.  yes i know the customer is always right, but that is a major no, no at any establishment you go to.  of course, the husband's standing there with his arms folded acting like a bouncer.

my poor manager, rather than say he's going to call the cops, he slowly puts his hands up in self defense and says ""o.k. now i'm a little worry you're going to start fighting with me"".  she starts screaming again and then all of a sudden, she yells at her husband.  ""let's go!""

he says ""you got it babe!""

and they both leave like nothing.

i know it's probably odd for a pizza shop to ask for credit card and i.d. but at least we had a reason for checking and even if she did have some ground to stand on, she made all the wrong choices for her to be in the right.

# lessons learned from this:

* dont boast about how you'll handle a situation all by yourself and then drag your man as a back up in case you lose the argument.
* dont proclaim to the world that you left you kid home alone and defenseless.
* never, ever, ever walk behind a counter.  the manager would have every right to call the cops.
* if you're not comfortable showing your i.d. don't order from that particular restaurant! end of story.",AlexTev123,tfys

this is a story about a time my dad was an entitled parent. it's kinda long and detailed. tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200b;

if you've ever heard the song ""started from the bottom"" by rapper drake, my dad is a living testament. he grew up very poor and in a bad neighborhood, but despite all odds he was able to graduate high school, join the army, get his bachelors, retire as a captain, and held a number of high paying management positions over the years.

because of these experiences, he's a firm believer of hard work, and taught my sister and i to be respectful of others because we may end up walking through similar streets. contradictory however, my dad is also one of those people who talks down to people that aren't as accomplished as him. he's really good at belittling others on the sly. he also liked to believe he was the smartest person in the room and that nobody except himself offered anything of substance. but sure, he gets on us if we say something about someone else.

everyday when he got home from work he'd always tell stories of how he got to fire people or humiliate them. he talks as if he was boasting about it. at first, i thought the stories were funny and what not, but overtime they sounded nasty. i honestly felt uncomfortable going out with him because he always gave people a hard time. didn't have the item(s) he wanted? he'll talk to your manager. things take longer than expected? you get an earful. any mild inconvenience? everyone is charged with a capital crime. he basically walked and talked as if the world owed him. one day, he pushed too far...

my family and i (lets call me slim) went out to eat at ihop on a friday night. i'm still in my work uniform, it had been a good day at work (this is kinda important). when we get in, the hostess says its would be about a 15-20 minute wait. my family is cool with it, i'm cool with it. not even 10 minutes later, my dad tells the hostess that we've been waiting for 20 minutes and what's taking so long. seriously dad? you don't see 30 other families packed in the restaurant? do you not hear the noise? i didn't say anything, but my sister and i gave each other the knowing look. that ""dad's about to start on that fuckshit again"" look. the hostess, obviously having an already difficult night, maintains her customer service smile and tells him it shouldn't be much longer from now and will let us know immediately. he stands against the wall. 5 minutes later a family pays and leaves, and we are directed to a table. my dad tells the server he doesn't want to sit at that particular table, and asks for a booth on the other side. the hostess hesitates for a moment before telling him that the server responsible for that section has a huge party, and that they may get a delay in service. my dad tells her to put us there anyway. i notice a young man flying back and forth to the kitchen and his tables in our row. i assumed this was our server. sure enough, this man comes over, introduces himself, and takes our drink orders. 8 minutes later, we haven't gotten our drinks. my dad flags him down and asks why our drinks haven't come. slightly reasonable i say. the server apologizes and gets our drinks. he returns, only to give us the wrong drinks. no big deal, honest mistake right? nope, my dad is pissed and sharply tells him to go redo our drinks. the server asks what they had once more. i can see he's a bit overwhelmed, and just politely tell him what i wanted. my dad however, tells him to write it down since he's ""too slow to remember."" everyone looked at him, even the serve was taken aback. this didn't seem to faze my dad though. he returns with the drinks and takes our orders. my dad again, tells him to write it down. my family is embarrassed and try to lessen the hostility in any way possible. after the server leaves, my mom and sister berate my dad telling him he's embarrassing us. of course, my dad doubles down telling us ""the customer is always right."" some time passes and our food hasn't arrived. i see the server is running back and forth to the massive party in the neighboring room. i think there were about 20 people in there, plus the 3 other families he had to attend to. to make sure he wasn't leaving the rest of us out, he asked a fellow server to see if we wanted refills and the like. the following interaction occured:

**fs (fellow server):** ""hey, i'm fs. just checking to make sure you're all taken care of here. can i get y'all any refills?""

**dad:** ""where's our original server? why couldn't he come do it himself?

\--again, are you fucking blind??--

**fs:** ""he's currently bringing out food and drink orders to another party. i will assist him for the time being.""

**dad:** ""that's disrespectful! why are they getting their food first? we've been waiting for xx minutes for our food. where is it??""

**fs:** ""uhhhmm, i can go find out real quick. give me a moment sir.""

**dad:** ""hurry up!""

\*fs raises an eyebrow and leaves\*

**me:** ""dad, chill out. it's a busy night.""

**dad:** ""don't back-sauce me slim. you don't want to start with me.""

&amp;#x200b;

a few minutes pass, and our original server comes back with our food and apologizes for the wait.

**os (original server):** ""hey everyone i apologize for that wait. taking care of a massive party, haha.""

**dad:** ""that's no excuse. we've been waiting!""

**mom:** *\*nudges dad\** ""hunny, stop.""

**os:** ""terribly sorry about that sir, really.""

\*os starts handing out food\*

**dad:** ""are you kidding me right now? my food is cold! we've been waiting xx minutes for our food to come. how long has our food been sitting out?

\--it should be noted that my dad ordered something that really didn't need to be warmed up. also he only touched the plate.--

**os:** ""i... i don't think it's been out too long sir. we have a heating lamp that-""

**dad:** ""are you sweating?""

**os:** ""sir?""

**dad:** ""you're sweating everywhere!""

**os:** ""i've been running back and forth. not to mention the kitchen is hot.""

**dad:** ""i don't want to hear excuses! you're sweaty, and you're getting it all over my food! get me your manager, now!""

our jaws hit the floor. os quietly goes for his manager. my dad all pissed-faced talking about the ""terrible"" service and our ""lazy disgusting unprofessional"" server. some people are looking over at us. my mom and sister looked like they wanted the earth to swallow them up. meanwhile i'm just boiling inside. os comes back with the store manager (sm).

**sm:** ""hello everyone, is everything okay?""

my dad proceeds to lay into the service and the server.

**dad:** ""i have a number of things to say. tonight i have had the worst service ever. my family and i have waited on drinks and they came out wrong. our server gets another server to do his job for him because he's too lazy to do it himself. when we get our food, our food is cold. apparently we weren't a priority. on top of that, he's sweating in our food! os has been a lazy, good-for-nothing, incompetent server the entire night and i've had it! i want our meals comped and this server needs to go!""

**sm:** \*wide-eyed\* ""oh goodness... sorry about the trouble sir...""

os is standing next to the sm in all of this, and he looks absolutely floored and looked like he wanted to shed a tear.

**sm:** ""here. i'll take care your meal, and here are these 30% off-""

i cut him off...

**me (standing up):** ""you know what, before all that i need to say something.""

**me to dad (paraphrasing):** ""i got to say i'm impressed on how far you're willing to go to be an absolute megadouche at everyone's expense. this entire night, and every other time we go out in public whether it's to eat or buy groceries, you make it your life's mission to make everyone extremely uncomfortable. what is it that makes you feel like you can do this? is it the money you make? what about all that hot garbage you talk about humility and being respectful to everyone because we might end up walking similar streets? oh, it's only applies to us, while you contradict everything you say. you're absolutely disgraceful! how dare you embarrass yourself and your family with your buttfuckery!""

**dad:** ""are you cussing at me?""

**me:** ""shut up, i'm talking now! we've heard your voice all damn night. lord knows i earned the right to speak! you see this uniform? you know i work at a restaurant. you even told me to be careful when it comes to pretentious people. yet here you are, behaving like them! this man has been running around doing his absolute best trying to make sure everyone is taken care of. he even recruited another server in order to make sure we were good. but if you'd take your head out your ass you'd understand. but no. we didn't even wait long for our food. you're acting like we're the only people in the packed-ass restaurant, and everyone's watching you be a headass about it! yes, the man is sweating, but none of that sweat touched the food, as he brought it on a tray away from him! we are sick and tired of you acting like a snobby arrogant fuck every time we go out somewhere. you're not impressing anybody and no one want to be seen with you!""

i did something i kinda regret after my anger subsided... 

**me (at the peak of my anger):** ""and your food... \*pushes plate into his lap\* ...ain't even need to be warmed up, it's a fucking salad!""

at this moment, i snap out of it. the restaurant is quiet. sm, os, everyone is looking at me absolutely stunned. the big party was all eyes. my mom and sister looked like they turned to stone. my dad's expression is something edged in my mind. i was 6'2 at the time and was really non-confrontational and soft-spoken. so for me to get as loud and imposing as i had was an unfamiliar sight to see to my folks. my dad, with the plate of salad dumped in his lap, looked like he wanted to beat my ass, shit bricks and crawl under the table all at once. i wanted to drive my point home so i dug into my wallet a pulled out $120 from the tips earned at work. i handed half of it to sm and told him not to comp the meal and that it was on me. the other half i gave to os and apologized for causing trouble. i looked at my family and told them i lost my appetite and that i'll wait in the car. the restaurant was murmuring when i left, and i sat in the car trying to process what the fuck i had done.

we didnt talk about it, but this event seemed to have clicked something in my dad, as i never again heard him give people unwarranted bullshit.

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr: my dad was an flaming entitled fuck. i put him in his place. everyone clapped (just kidding).

to end this i wanted to add a proverb of sorts from the netherlands.

823,this hot chocolate is too hot,"when i was a teenager i worked in a popular coffee shop. on the morning this happened i was working with a new barista. she was practicing using the espresso and milk steaming machine, i was on cash. 

&amp;#x200b;

in the middle of a large rush we have a woman with a child come in and order a child's hot chocolate and a coffee. children's hot chocolates are made at a low temperature. i remind my coworker of this when i pass her the cup with the order written on the side. she makes the drink, checking the temperature with a thermometer before placing the drink on the counter. 

&amp;#x200b;

the woman picks up the hot chocolate and takes a sip. 

customer: ""this is too hot"" 

me: ""i'm sorry ma'am, let us remake that for you""

customer: ""children's hot chocolates are supposed to be cold!""

me: ""we'll have one ready for you right away""

&amp;#x200b;

this time i decide to make the drink because i have been working there longer and was more comfortable with the machine. i make the drink slightly colder than the specified temperature and hand it to her. 

&amp;#x200b;

customer: ""this hot chocolate is too hot, are you trying to scald my child?!""

me: ""i'm sorry ma'am, i made that drink slightly cooler than the specified temperature for children. would you be interested in a chocolate milk or something iced?""

customer: ""we have always ordered hot chocolates at this location and they are never scalding hot""

me: ""alright ma'am we will try to address this issue for you.""

&amp;#x200b;

at this point we have a bit of a backlog so we help some other customers. i notice that we have the first hot chocolate sitting on the counter next to the machine. i was young so i decided to hand her the original drink, which was now cold. 

&amp;#x200b;

customer: ""this one is perfect, was that so hard?! i should call your manager and let her know about your attempt to serve a hot beverage to my child! i should be compensated!"" 

me: ""i'm sorry you feel that way, please feel free to call my manager and let her know about the situation."" 

&amp;#x200b;

when the manager came in she asked both of us to make a child's hot chocolate. she was satisfied that we had the correct temperature but warned us to be careful. 

&amp;#x200b;

the same woman came in the following week and ordered her ""usual"". i mixed some chocolate syrup into the milk and served it in a hot drink cup. she sampled the drink and smirked at me.

&amp;#x200b;

customer: "" i see that your manager reprimanded you after you tried repeatedly to burn my child.  i hope you have learned a valuable lesson from all of this. "" 

&amp;#x200b;

i learned to always serve her chocolate milk. ",sleutels,tfys

825,"service/hospitality workers, do you have high expectations when you go out to eat?","my friends and i might’ve made the mistake of giving away that we were in the industry as hosts &amp; servers and what followed was very lazy service. 
some things we noticed were: 

• forgetting orders

• wrong steak temp: i ordered med rare and realized the steak i received was rare but didn’t think much of it. when she took away our plates she saw the steak and just laughed “omg did they cook it at all? did your steak moo at you?” 😒

• telling us she’s tired tbh

• slow service on a slow night

• no knowledge of beer or up-selling at all

• unenthusiastic the whole time

• didn’t ask if we’re together or separate 

• no refills til later 

• asks if everything’s okay then runs away in 2seconds

• no silverware on table even after food was brought out 


even after i help a guest, i always ask is there anything else i can do for you? before i leave the table. 

i realize different establishments have different standards but we were just very disappointed and would’ve loved an enthusiastic server with knowledge of the beers (as a restaurant + brewery concept). it was as if a regular person with no formal training had taken care of us. 

should we have had lower expectations? what are some standard ones you look for in a great server?",Lifeissweet7,tfys
826,“i ordered crispy noodles ... but didn’t think they would actually be crispy”.,"last night, a table of three sit themselves and rearrange my tables pushing two of our smaller tables together. i was taking an order from the little mezzanine area upstairs so couldn’t get myself downstairs fast enough to greet and seat them since i work alone.
i ask them if they would instead take the bigger table so i could free up the smaller tables for single diners.
they declined and told me they want to sit like that. even making a remark of “well it’s hardly busy now!!!”

they tell me they are ready to order, the guy has his leg up on the table, the girls are laughing at the description of some of our dishes and laughing at the anglicised chinese names.
of course they are not really ready, talking between themselves as i stand there waiting. i try to say that i will come back, give them another minute but they insist that they are ready.
the girl asks me “which dumplings is better? the pan fried or the ones in soup?”
i tell her that the pan fried ones are more popular, crispy bottoms and soft tops. she barks at me “ughhhhh i hate pan fried dumplings”. okay sounds like you already know what you want then, so i really didn’t see the point of that question.
i carry on, smiling and being polite, the guy with his leg still on the table says “i want the crispy noodles please! with squid and prawn” 
alright, everything is straightforward enough. a few side dishes and a main each. the food starts coming out, i bring out the dishes and the guy shouts “hey!!! i need a knife and fork!!!! i can’t use these freakin’ sticks”
i bring him some cutlery, one of the girls ask me for a fresh orange juice, i tell her we don’t have fresh orange juice so she demands that i bring back the menus so she can point it out on the menu for me.
she points at the menu. “this!! fresh orange juice!”.  i inform her that it reads on the menu “fresh carrot juice” and then she makes a face at me and says “ugh that’s gross”. so no juice then. 

they continue to ask for things 
“one beer”
“no another beer!”
“chilli sauce...”
“no wait ! we also want sweet chilli sauce !”
“i want wooden chopsticks instead of these plastic ones” 

i am accommodating, tending to their every requests (which where endless despite me asking if there was anything else i could get then each time). i continue to be polite and serve with a smile despite raging a little on the inside.

finally they finish their food, ask for the bill.  one of the girls asks for the remains of her seaweed salad to be boxed up despite there being only about two pieces of cucumber and one piece of lettuce left. of course, anything for you my valued customer.
they throw three cards at me and as i am putting the cards through the machine, the guy says “i ordered crispy noodles ... but didn’t think they would actually be crispy”.

and i thought there is literally no helping some people. there are some huge morons in this world and there is no point in wasting energy getting mad at these kinds of idiots.

so we decided to do an office show trivia for tonight. advertised it and all but wasn't expecting much. holy. shit.

like 120 people showed up. it got to the point where it was all hands on deck in the kitchen and any servers not doing anything to go upstairs and help out. all with a typical tuesday night staff. it was chaos. the sales reached $1900 from 7:30 to 9:30. 

we had to push people away cuz it got too full, a lot of them got angry. although it was completely unexpected how crazy it would get, we're definitely gonna be more prepared for the next themed trivia night, which is star wars. that's gonna be wild.

829,refusal of service leads to being told to rot in hell and a $100 tip,"hi, first time poster (posted under my other account a few days ago but deleted the post because i had to edit it and fix it up). also on mobile so if the formatting isn’t right i’m sorry. 
tl;dr at the bottom. 

so a little background into it before i start the story. i work in a pub in a not so pleasant area it’s a pretty dodgy area but it’s good pay and i love my managers. australia is pretty strict with their alcohol policy and coming everyone wanting to serve alcohol has to undergo training called responsible service of alcohol (rsa) so you have to follow the regulations in place.

key: m= me, cw= coworker, dg= drunk guy, s= security, nc= nice customer

so to set the scene, there was a highly anticipated football match on for these two teams and i remember that it was very busy and at my job the owners are pretty strict as to cleanliness of the venue especially as the part i was working in was the gaming room that allowed smoking so we had to make sure there were no more than 3 cigarette butts in the ashtrays at all times as well as no empty glasses and no ring marks from cups or cigarette ash on the benches as well as other thing so basically once you finish going around to all 30 machines and cleaning them you have to do it again 10 minutes later. 

this day we had a bunch of people watching the game as well as our normal customers playing the poker machines and we were short staffed, so in between cleaning i was running to both bars making sure everyone was fine and didn’t need help. the bar in the gaming room was getting busy so i finished cleaning and went to go help serve, this is what happened:

m: hi, what can i get you today?

dg: can i get a beer

m: sure, here you go

at this point cw pulled me aside and said,

cw: i wouldn’t have served him if i were you, he looks on the verge of intoxication

m: oh crap, i wasn’t paying attention, it’s just really busy and wanted to help clear out the line while the ad break was on

cw: don’t worry about it, if he comes back for another beer just refuse him service as we’ve cut him off as per rsa guidelines

m: ok, sweet i’ll keep an eye on him and let everyone else know

i went back to cleaning and looked up and saw that cw was delivering complementary soft drinks to the people playing the machines and that dg was at the bar. 

dg: can i get another beer? (at this point i noticed that he was slurring his words and swaying on his feet)

m: i’m sorry sir but unfortunately i can’t serve you any more drinks as you have been cut off for today

dg: cut off? cut off? wtf, why am i cut off? im not even drunk

m: i’m sorry sir but there’s nothing i can do, i’m just following the policy put in place and if you want another drink you’ll have to come back tomorrow. (mind you, security are just standing there, not doing anything. they’re pretty hopeless unless you actually ask them to do something) 

dg: no i will not come back tomorrow, i want my drink now and your going to pour it for me and ill pay for it

m: i’m sorry but there’s nothing i can do, once you’re cut off, you’re cut off. you’ll have to come back tomorrow

dg: you! you’re a horrible person and i think you should rot in hell because that is where you belong!

m: oh, thank you sir, i appreciate the feedback. security! (honestly i didn’t care that he just said that, you develop a thick skin in that industry)

s: what seems to be the problem?

m: dg wants another beer however he has been cut off and is not accepting it. i need you to escort him from the venue

s: sure, if you come this way sir. (security escorted him out and told him to come back tomorrow)

i started cleaning the bar and putting glasses away when nc walks up to the bar

nc: i’m sorry, but are you ok?

m: oh yeah i’m fine, thanks for asking

nc: are you sure? i was watching from the side in case it turned violent and wasn’t sure if you needed a witness as the security here is terrible

m: oh thanks, yeah security are too busy watching the game to really care. thanks anyway. what can i get you to drink.

nc: oh no, i’m not drinking tonight. i just wanted to come up and let you know that i’ve been working in this industry for over 40 years and i don’t think i wouldn’t have handled as well as you did

m: wow, 40 years that’s pretty cool

nc: yeah and because i wouldn’t have handled it as well as you did, i wanted to give you this. please don’t share it with your coworkers, this is for you and only you. i remember being your age working these hours and dealing with terrible people

nc handed me $100 

m: oh no, that’s too much. i can’t accept it

nc: just take it and don’t share it

m: ok, thank you so much. enjoy your night

fast forward about a week and dg comes back in

dg: can i get a beer?

m: sure, here you go (i kind of brushed him off and wanted him to go away)

dg: is everything ok? i sense some hostility here

m: yeah, everything’s ok if you count you telling me to go to hell ok?

dg: no i didn’t do that, that must be someone else

m: no it was you, you’re wearing the same hat and have the same backpack. you were intoxicated and i cut you off and you told me i should rot in hell and that i’m a horrible person

dg: oh ok, sorry about that

dg got his beer, drank it and left quickly. he hasn’t returned back to the venue if i’m on shift. i think he’s embarrassed but i don’t really care

831,"my table eats most of their food, pays, and then complains about ""hair"" in their meal???","this happened last weekend.

this family of 4 came in, a mom, dad, teenage daughter, and a toddler. for the most part they were okay, a little needy which got annoying but always thanking me. i checked up on them multiple times, and even though they had me running back and forth bc they were the types that kept realizing they needed something after 30 trips back and forth, my other tables were super nice so i didn't think too much of it.

so they finally ask for the check and some to-go boxes, the daughter is kind of annoying bc she keeps asking for refills of her drink and finally a to-go cup, so i drop everything off. i go into the kitchen to be productive and help out while i wait for them to pay, and when i go back after a few minutes i see that the dad is putting his credit card into the check presenter so that's my cue to go over and ask if they're ready. i close them out, give dad back his card and the receipt that he needs to sign, and then the mom is finishing her food and she goes, ""hey-,"" and she leans closer to read my nametag, ""invisiblespacedog. \[she my name super fake sweet and fake concerned\] i just need to see a manager. i'm just finishing the last of my shrimp and lobster with the rice pilaf, and \[she pushes a grain of rice aside\] i see this thing on my rice...."" she points at a line in the rice with her fork. ""i think it's hair,"" she says. i'm just gobsmacked at this point bc it's so clearly not a hair, it's the natural markings in the rice, and on every other grain of rice on the plate lol. she was calm the whole time and they even put their measly 10% tip in the check book and gave it to me, and by this time i'm done so i just take the book and say with the same fakeness ""ohmygosh i'm so sorry, i'll have my manager come right over!"" i already know what her intentions are, and it disgusts me even though i should be used to it by now since i work in a corporate restaurant.

i'm lowkey fuming at this point bc how do you pay and then complain right after paying like what is that gonna get you? their meal was $80, we can't comp something you already paid for you dumbass, and i'm just like ""wtf"" the entire time i walk into the back to blow off steam. i let my manager know and he goes to talk to them. when he comes back he tells me he's gonna try to return the partial cost on the card, but since the system won't let him, he gives her a gift card for the cost of the individual meal, which is like $30????? they seem happy with this and leave but like.....in the aftermath of it i'm just so tired of managers being total pushovers. anyone with a brain and eyes knows that what she was pointing out wasn't hair. but, sigh, i digress.

832,the creepy new guy,"hi everyone! first time poster :) this story actually happened a couple months ago, but it makes me laugh every time i think about it. (tl/dr at the bottom, it's a long one lol)

&amp;#x200b;

so this new guy gets hired. he's about 23 and on first impression he seems pretty nice, just kind of awkward/strange. let's call him justin.

&amp;#x200b;

he's not a great employee, he's super slow and super awkward with guests and other employees, but we try to train him the best that we can.

&amp;#x200b;

justin has been working for a week or two when some complaints start to come in about him from a few of the high-school-aged girls. most of the complaints are brought right to me; i'm one of the only female managers so i think a lot of the younger girls felt comfortable talking to me about it. basically, i learn that he's gotten at least four of the 15/16/17 year old's snapchats, and he's been talking to them outside of work in a pretty flirty manner. (i saw a couple of the texts, and they were definitely inappropriate for a 23 year old to be sending to teenagers.) they also tell me that he's been making them uncomfortable at work.

&amp;#x200b;

i report this to my gm and another manager right away. they have a talk with him, and they tell me that he was very apologetic, that they're giving him a second chance, and that he knows that he'll be fired right away if anything else happens. alright, i'll give him a second chance too.

&amp;#x200b;

the next week, i'm leading a shift that justin is working. everything is going fine, we're not too busy so i'm giving out breaks. things start to go downhill when justin gets his break.

&amp;#x200b;

our kitchen is set up so that near the prep station, there's a pretty large window overlooking the dining room. if you stand in the prep section, you can easily see the person sitting in the booth right in front of the window. in this case, you can easily see the back of justin's head and what he's doing on his phone.

&amp;#x200b;

two team members come up to me and tell me that they see justin recording people in the dining room with his phone. i walk over and there he is, snapchat open, clearly filming a table full of teenage girls across the dining room. he's in his work uniform being super obvious about it, and this is not even a week after he was talked to about inappropriate behavior.

&amp;#x200b;

i stormed out there immediately. i told him i saw what he was doing and i thought it was extremely inappropriate. he told me that he was ""just focusing his camera!"" i was pissed and told him that i needed to talk to him when he was done with his break. to be honest, i was pretty intimidated by him and not sure what to do. i texted my gm and he told me that it was okay for me to just send justin home for the day and tell him that he would have to have a talk with the gm the next time he worked. i'm comfortable with this, so i tell justin i need to talk to him in the back (away from the guests).

&amp;#x200b;

(m=me, j=justin)

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;m: hey justin, i think it would be best if you just went home for today. the behavior that i saw today was inappropriate and i it's best for you to have a talk with gm.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;j: i told you what i was doing! i thought i knew those girls so i was taking a picture!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;m: uh, you said you were just focusing your camera before.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;j: yeah... i thought i knew them so i was focusing my camera!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;m: okay, well you can talk to gm about that. i would feel most comfortable if you just went home for the day. you're not in trouble, i think this is just what's best right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;j: i knew you had it out for me since i started. you've been trying to get me fired! i could tell that you didn't love me! fuck this bullshit!

&amp;#x200b;

justin proceeds to clock out and storm out of the building. he texts my gm saying that he would like to quit and how we never loved him.

&amp;#x200b;

a couple days later, a coworker tells me that justin texted him after he left calling me a ""bitch who was out for him from the beginning"" and, in all seriousness, that he ""put a voodoo curse on me."" so far i have not experienced any effects of this curse...

&amp;#x200b;

in addition to the voodoo curse, a couple team members had me listen to a diss track that justin sent to them. lucky me, he calls me out in his shitty rap! it goes something like, ""you made up lame excuses to get me fired, you say you're with god but you left me out on the street, etc.""

&amp;#x200b;

tl/dr: new employee gets complaints for being creepy to teenage girls. when i catch him in the act of being a creep, he freaks out, puts a voodoo curse on me, and makes a diss track against me.",lilminch,tfys
833,tip pooling in seattle,"hello! thanks for taking the time to read my post, if this isn't in the right spot please feel free to redirect me!! i just started working at a small restaurant in seattle. everyone in the restaurant including dishwasher, cooks, and servers are paid $12 an hour and tip pool. now that's not a problem with me, except for the fact that the owner includes herself into the pool, she's always at work and sometimes serves tables but continuously sits down chats with customers drinks a couple glasses of wine and takes an hour long breaks all the time to facetime with friends. i'm just wondering if this is legal? i was under the belief that in washington you couldnt use tips to cover the minimum wage if you're tip pooling, just wondering if this is a normal thing! thanks!",EkatarinaMargaret,tfys

836,170° of stupid,"i work at a small chain bakery at the mall and was opening on a weekend. we clean the crathos twice a week and i’m usually the one to do them so after dismantling them i go into the back to clean them. we’re not open at this point, it being a little after 8:00am and the store opening in half an hour. my manager is in the front frosting a tray of cinnamon rolls but goes in the back to grab something once she’s finished, leaving them out in the open. for what couldn’t have been more than 15 seconds, no one is at the front of the shop.

for a little background, our cinnamon rolls have to be at least 170°f to be sure they’re cooked full through, along with a few other tests just in case. the pans themselves ought to be at least 200° but i’ve never check in earnest. we check this before frosting them and although these cinnamon rolls were sitting out it hadn’t been for very long at all (see: “couldn’t have been more than 15 seconds).

my manager goes to the front and then calls back to me: “hey, did you sell a cinnamon roll?”

me: “no why?”
her: “are you sure?”
me: “yeah?”

i walk out to see what the fuss is about and she shows me that a roll is missing from the tray. we question each other for a second before another guest comes up to us.

“i saw a lady go an grab it. she was eating it out of her hand when she walked away.”

if you’ve been to my mall, that’s not hard to believe at all. i’ve actually seen weirder things. the fact that a person could grab a 170° pastry with her bare hand and eat it. it was the temperature that really got me. both my manager and i were dumbfounded. we ended up throwing away the whole tray.

tl;dr a crackhead lady grabbed a 170°f cinnamon roll out of a 200°f tray with her bare hands and ate it out of her hand like a fucking apple.",frannakie,tfys
837,"person orders medium cooked salmon, loses her mind.","i work in a chain restaurant and i was closing one night. i had a party of 4 as one of my last tables and everybody had good vibes...until their friend showed up. the three individuals ordered drinks and waited for the 4th guest to arrive. the 4th person was the main person and were there for a celebration. so, i took their order and got appetizers started then took their main entree order. the 4th modified one of our dishes to the point my manager charged her extra for the modifications. the 4th guest requested a medium temperature salmon on her dish told me specifically it had to be cooked that way otherwise she would send it back. honestly, i knew shit was going to go downhill from here because of the medium temperature salmon. 

twenty minutes later the food arrives and everyone is having a blast except the 4th guest. the lady is not satisfied with how its cooked and demanded it to be taken back and i told her ""i will certainly have another one made for you."". at this time, i got my manager involved as well as the kitchen manager, i told them exactly what was going on and they proceeded to make sure the salmon was cooked medium. now, i don't know why a person would ask for that unless you're asking to get sick. the kitchen manager then brought out the second salmon and right away the 4th guest lost her fucking mind. she cut into the salmon and started screaming ""do you think this is funny!? is your kitchen fucking with me ? do you find this funny? huh do you ? take this back i want another one"" she then proceeded to throw a bitch fit for a few more minutes.  the other guests at the table had to calm her down because she was making a scene. i explained to management yet again what happened and they brought out another one. nope, was not cooked medium and she began to scream even more. 

at the end of the night their bill was about $200 with the other entrees, apps, and bar drinks. she had no alcohol because she also told me that she doesn't drink which is totally fine. my manager comped her meal and the salmons. when it was time to pay, she gave me a nasty look and i asked if she needed change, she said ""nope, let this be a lesson for you"". the amount she gave me was $201. the 4th guest then added ""tipping is an option, don't you ever forget that. "". i walked away because i was somewhat upset and closed out the tab. moments later she then asked me for a to-go drink and i proceeded to add ""serving you is also an option, don't you ever forget that. our transaction is finished."". i proceeded to do my side work, cash out and went home. i believe this was the first time i stood up to a rude guest in a somewhat polite way. 

either way i hope the 4th guest gets knocked off her high horse because she needs it.

840,21 minutes?!,"right so this actually happened a few years ago at the national diner chain i serve at. so a few years ago corporate tried telling us that from the time the customer walked in the door to the time they left the total time elapsed in our restaurant should be 21 minutes. what?! yeah that's ridiculous for a sit down diner. they wanted me to get the drink, appetizer and meal in the very first visit of the table. i understand it's the table turns you want, but damn, people don't want to feel rushed. 

now i've been in multiple customer service jobs my entire working life. and the people that get a temper over the most trivial stuff always makes for a wonderful story.

cue in the guy who comes in by himself. guy in his 50s has major rbf. so with my manager looking over my shoulder from across the dining room to make sure i do this new protocol correctly, i ask him;

server (me)- hi there. what can i get for you to drink tonight? we have (insert drinks salespitch here).

customer- i'll just have a black coffee.

s- absolutely. and would you like to start off with any appetizers?

c- no

now some people come to my restaurant specifically for certain items and don't even need to look at a menu. so i ask him;

s- alright, and do you know what you'd like? or would you like a few minutes to look at the menu?

c- (slams down his menu) now how would i know what i want? i just sat down!

s- oh fair enough. some people don't even need a menu when they come in here. (laughing to try  and recover) i'll give you a few minutes.

now i'd been very light hearted and joking as best i could to make the situation less tense. regardless i left, made his coffee. gave him about another 5 minutes before returning with his coffee.

s- here ya go. still need a few minutes to decide?

c- (looks up condescendingly) just get me another f-ing server. 

s- sounds good!

that guy. he's a good one for seeing how people have such short fuses and don't think about the whole of things. i don't know. that's on of my go to's. thought i'd share cause we've all had a guy like this.

841,”arrest me. arrest me! arrest me!!!”,"this story happened at a brewery that was hosting a concert which serves beer. not sure if this is the perfect spot, but i think it fits.

the brewery i worked at was rather large and put on concerts during the summer months. it was an outdoor venue, which meant that weather conditions significantly impacted attendance. 

usually when it rained people would just head down the street to the local bars and maybe come back to the concert if the weather cleared up. however, for safety reasons, if lightning was seen, the brewery would open up their tasting room and tour center for the guests (no easy feat fitting hundreds of people into this space). 

i was at the brewery for three years and this story takes place on the only day my manager pulls the trigger to start taking the party inside (because of the thunder and lighting).

my assistant manager, myself and a few choice coworkers are running around inside trying to get everything set up when i notice a drunk customer holding up the entrance to the tour center. the two girls at the entrance selling beer tickets (both attractive college aged girls), are doing their best to move him along, but he has no interest in doing anything but talk to them. 

one of the girls catches my eye and mouths “help,” so i come over to intervene. i introduce myself and ask him to kindly move along. he gives some resistance, and i say “sir, if you don’t move out of this entrance way, i’m going to have to ask that police officer *gestures to a nearby officer* to remove you from the area.” 

he backs off and leaves the entrance area, and i got back to managing the chaos to the best of my ability. however, just a few minutes go by and i come back to the area to see that he has creeped back to the front. i approach him again and say “this is your last warning, you really need to get out of here.” he nods and i turn the corner, but assume this guy isn’t going to be cooperative. sure enough he’s back talking to the girls.

i approach him again and let him know it’s time to leave. he responds with “you want to take this outside?” i don’t respond to him and nod to the police officer and let him know it’s time for this gentleman to leave. 

the girls up front thank me for helping them out and i get back to the chaos. a few minutes later i’m taking an empty keg out to the parking lot, and i see that the man is still talking to the officer who escorted him out and another officer who has joined them. 

the man is yelling about why he cannot go back inside and the officers and reminding him that he has overstayed his welcome, but is welcome to go down the street to any of the other bars. 

the drunk man continues to protest and demand that he be allowed back into the brewery. the police officers tell him that he is not allowed on the brewery’s property because he has been asked to leave, and if he persists he will be charged with trespassing. 

the drunk man takes this as an invitation to start yelling “arrest me then! come on, arrest me! arrest me!!” the officers clearly did not want to have to arrest this man, but after the 7th or 8th demand to arrest him, the officers turned him around, handcuffed him, and put him in the back of a patrol car. 

i managed to drag my feet long enough to catch this entire exchange before heading back into the, now indoor, concert. i returned grinning ear to ear, and had an excellent story to share with my coworkers after the concert ended.  

tldr: drunk guy holds up line talking to pretty girls. i intervene three times, and eventually a cop has to escort him out. guy argues with officers so long about not being allowed back into event that they end up arresting him for trespassing.

843,allergic reactions.,"just found this community today and after years of waiting tables i have loads of stories so expect to see me here frequently!
the first one i’m going to mention is going to cover two separate incidents that both revolve around allergic reactions.
the first happened about a decade ago when i was working in a university canteen (or refectory as they called it) we would serve breakfast, lunch and dinner but on weekdays breakfast was limited to cereals and toast but at weekends we had the option of a full english breakfast. (toast, beans, sausage, bacon, eggs,
mushrooms, tomatoes ect) 
we had around 4,000 students on site so everything was bulk buy and cooked in huge quantities.
we had each item labelled individually as to whether it was vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free ect so you were rarely asked these kinds of questions.
well one saturday while serving breakfast i noticed a commotion at one of the tables i went over to see if i could help to see this poor girl going into anaphylactic shock and pointing towards her epi-pen. gave her the jab and called the medical team.
turned out she was allergic to shellfish, which puzzled us all as what on earth contained shellfish in her fry up?!
baked beans apparently.  😂
was from a cheap bulk buy company called 3663 if i remember rightly, they supply places like schools, hospital and prisons. 
anyway second time was about 6 or 7 years ago in a restaurant i worked at.
customer started off well by informing me there daughter had a severe dairy allergy. i went through what was dairy free and what wasn’t despite it being on the menu and we were away.
meal went fine, no issues until dessert hit the table.
now when they prompted me as to what was diary free when ordering starters and mains i made sure they didn’t order the wrong thing but when it came do desserts i completely forgot this was an allergy table.
i know i should have remembered but it was a busy restaurant at peak time and i didn’t think.
anyway customer orders sorbet for the daughters dessert assuming its dairy free.
cue full blown anaphylactic shock and parents going ape sh*t.
sorbet was not marked as dairy free on menu as it contained ‘milk proteins’ but even these proteins were enough to set her off in a big way.
they were angry and upset ‘holiday was ruined’ ‘all your fault’ ect ect 
don’t think they paid a thing towards the bill in the end. 😂

stay tuned for more stories on being hit on, thrown up on, cleaning up kids p*ss and sh*t and generally insulted on a day to day basis! 

edit; missed the ‘not’ in ‘sorbet was (not) marked as dairy free on menu as it contained milk proteins....’ which made it sound like it wasn’t properly labelled. apologies.",ConspiracyBoy87,tfys
844,the night my busser got a bj,"this may be a bit long, but if you read it all the way through, you will get a ""happy ending"".this happened about 10 years ago while i was working at a fine dining seafood restaurant. because it of it's location, we served a lot of the ""desperate housewives"" type. i was waiting on an 8 top of this sort. they were very friendly, and definitely down to have some fun. as, i was getting their drink order they mentioned my busser, a good friend of mine that was a very handsome young man (he was 19 at the time). we will call him a. i laughed, winked, and said i would make sure he would be a strong presence throughout their meal. it worked out well for me because a was flattered and did all the grunt work for their table. their meal went great, they all got a bit tipsy, but one of them was drunk. they were my last table of the night, so they asked my a and i to go next door for a drink with them. the restaurant layout was a bit different as we had banquet facilities upstairs, and a cigar bar attached. neither of them were affiliated with our restaurant, but there were ""employee only"" doors that gave us access to both places. so everyone says they will meet up next store, as i have to cash out and my buddy has to clean their table. they must have been doing shots or their xanax kicked in, because they are all trashed when i get to the bar. as soon as i walk in they are all over me,""we loooossst karen."" blowing it off, thinking she is probably in the bathroom, i go to grab a drink. we are hanging for about 30 minutes, when i realize a should have been here 15-20 minutes ago. i text him, and the realization hit me. oh no, a, what have you done? ten minutes later, karen walks in, with a very strange look on her face, and her and her friends leave almost immediately. a pops up 2 seconds later with a shit-eating grin. apparently they had gone up to the banquet facility, which was empty at this point, and she had given him a beejer. all of the employees used the facility for a place to take a quick break when there weren't any banquets going on, so i was kinda pissed because it happened in my favorite chair. i certainly wouldn't ever be flopping down in that one again.",lrm914,tfys
845,always show your groupons at the beginning of the meal!!,"so i work at a pretty casual but also kinda expensive restaurant by the river in florida. it’s a sunday night and a young four top comes in. they order multiple rounds and a couple appetizers. we also had a bunch of free appetizer coupons out at the time so i let them use them on one check even though we technically aren’t supposed to. my manager doesn’t really care and they seem cool so i let them do it. then they order very expensive entrees in addition. their check is really starting to rack up. i was surprised that they were spending so much money, since usually young people (like myself) are broke and buy the cheapest sandwiches. 
anyway i bring them the check, and wait as they are sorting out between them. i come back and they hand me a groupon and a card. i tell them the groupon is only valid monday-wednesday, it says so on the groupon. they tell me no it doesn’t. so i check it and they are right it doesn’t, and that’s because we have multiple locations and it specifically says this groupon is for the other location, and in bold, not the one they are at right now. i tell them i will ask my manager, but i say he probably won’t be able to use it. and he yea he doesn’t let them use it. so now they have this huge bill they have to pay, when they were thinking they were gonna get $100+ off of it. 
moral of the story, always show your groupons at the beginning. the two things it said right there were 1) show the waiter at beginning of meal 2) not valid at the location they were currently at.

hi, im a 22 year old female and this happened between my 20/21 year of life, so about half a year ago. 
i was working at a zoo store. i sold stuffed animals, shirts, etc... i had an hour lunch break and in ""my"" zoo they provided lunch. so i wen t to the cafeteria/bar, eat my lunch in 10/20 min and help the lunch ladies if it was full (not my obligation, i like to help). i got along with them so i never had a problem until...
so, one day i finish eating and when heading to the kitchen i noticed that one item was missing so i say to one of the ladies this: 

me: hey, this is missing

lady: i know it's missing. you think you can come up here and tell me how to do my job? you think you are my boss? you think i owe you anything? (all of this screaming) 

i was taken back and got really shocked so i just say sorry and leave the kitchen. i then stand in another place of the bar but i could still hear her screaming awful things about me. 

my lunch hour is over so i return to the store. everything goes normal till the end and when in leaving she stops me halfway and starts lecturing me in from of the customers (our exit path was the same as the costumers). 

she is saying how she is going to report me, how i am awful for criticizing her. how in gonna end up without a job not being so stupid and all other awful things. 

i left in tears, still in my work outfit and i had two lovely old ladies stop me and comforting me, saying that she was a disgrace because she shouldn't be talking to me like that out in the open.

847,"""i'm not a foreigner, give me a discount.""","for some context, i work in a cafe inside a historical building in a park that also has a small kiosk cafe outside. the kiosk has a small seating area set up in front of it, and the entrance to the seating area has two signs set up on either side of it with menus. the area customers place orders at has a menu. the place that customers take their drinks to add sugar to them had another copy of the menu. lots of menus, all of which specify our prices and sizes.

so up comes a customer, and the interaction goes something like this.

customer: i'll have a cappuccino. (i start preparing it.) and i'm a local, so don't give me the foreigner's price.

me: ... i'm sorry, what do you mean?

c: you can give it to me for cheaper than whatever price you give to tourists, i'm from (the city this happened in).

me: we don't... actually have different prices for locals and tourists. all our prices are on the menu. sorry. 

needless to say i wasn't actually sorry for not complying with the borderline racist policy he thought we had or should have. nowhere in the city charges tourists a higher price, at least to my knowledge, so where he got the idea he'd get away with this is beyond me.

he's clearly frustrated, gets his coffee and pays. it's then he sees the menu by the place where customers add sugar, where the sizes and prices are listed. as they were in several other places he would have seen by now.

c: i see you charged me for the most expensive cappuccino you have. you didn't tell me there was a cheaper one.

me: you just asked for a cappuccino, sir. it's our policy to give regular sized coffees to people who don't specify they want a small one. 

which it is. i didn't call him out on the fact that he had every opportunity to look at a menu, or the fact that our cups both regular and small are clearly visible to customers when they order.

i will add i accidentally left him, like, a couple of cents short when i was giving him his change because i was a little flustered (confrontation of any kinds gives me bad anxiety) and he called me out on it as if it was intentional and i was trying to steal from him. i apologised and told him i'd just miscounted, an honest mistake, and gave him what he was meant to be owed. 

he continues to huff, and i hear him very loudly telling another customer (a regular who has never complained and who he apparently knows)  of how terrible the service is and how we're trying to cheat him out of money. she didn't seem to really care, i get the feeling she was only listening to be polite.

848,brain surgery - threesomes - and the kitchen. bell?!,"i was a bartender/server at a local craft beer bar about three years ago, and this particular story happened on a monday night. i remember it was a monday because things were particularly slow, which allowed this experience to take place.

three people walk into my nearly empty bar and i greet them with our drink menu. the middle aged woman immediately responds with “i’m getting brain surgery tomorrow, so we’re going to need a lot of these.” after recovering from this exchange, i get them their first round of drinks.

after some more casual conversation (there wasn’t much else to do), i learn that the middle aged woman is the mother of one of the mid twenties boys, and the third guy is the son’s friend. things go normal at first, but after some drinks, and eventually jager bombs, the conversation takes a turn.

the son starts off this story with: “what would you do in my situation,” and i listen as he continues. “so my buddy and his girl come over to hang out, and at one point he asks me if i want to have a threesome with him and his girl” 

*me assuming this is where the ethical dilemma comes in, begins to respond but get quickly cut off*

“so we do it and it was great. but here’s where the tricky part comes in. my boys’ girl comes back to my place a few hours later, and she wants to do it again, but just with me. soooooo, what would you have done.”

i take a moment to collect myself and start stuttering out a bewildered response as he cuts me off again and says, “well i went ahead and did it! i mean come on, we already did it once, what’s the difference.” then mom jumps into the party, “yeah!! he already did it once! what’s the harm!” 

i proceed to give the guy and mumbled response of “yeah, i guess so” while i recover from the story, and try to analyze the mother-son relationship that would allow this story to be told in her presence. 

the rest of the night is no stranger than the already established status quo, and they eventually leave. as i’m closing up i notice that the kitchen bell is missing, and realize the son must have taken it. i’m only confident it was him because as they were leaving i thought i heard a bell from his backpack, but just attributed it to the fact that i hear the thing 50
times a day during food service. it was an extremely inconvenient thing to take because the kitchen staff had to bang a spoon on a pan the whole next day, to signal food was ready, before the manager was able to replace the bell. 

the mother tipped me well for my company and service, and i do genuinely hope that her surgery went well and she recovered nicely. i certainly have gotten good mileage out of this story, and thought it appropriate to share here! ",tramplily,tfys

she said sure and hands me her license. in our state the vertical licenses are usually for someone who is under 18 or just hasnt needed to renew it. horizontal licenses mean you're 21 and over otherwise it's stated at the bottom when you turn 18 and when you turn 21.

851,"""do y'all take food stamps?""","i worked at a family friend's restaurant as a cashier and server. it was a family owned business.
i can see and hear everything from the register, and because i'm a people watcher, it was perfect for me. 
anyway, a three top, a mom(em) and her two daughters(ed1 and ed2), came in one night and i happened to be the cashier/hostess. they seemed sketchy the moment they walked in. i took them to their table and let their server(s) know. it was a slower night than usual so i could hear everything perfectly. they get their drinks and then their server takes their order. the server walks away to go put in the order.
em: *as server walks away* do yall take food stamps?
s: *laughs thinking em is joking* no ma'am. 
em: *obviously angry* oh ok. well, can i get any discounts?
s: you can order our #10 which is our college/senior burger.
em: ugh... no.
s then puts in their order and goes to the drink station and tells another server what just happened. as they're talking ed2 gets up and walks to the wall right behind the drink station and listens thinking no one sees her. (this is important later)
a little later, they're mostly through their appetizer when ed1 calls s over and shows her a hair. s apologizes and takes the plate and shows the rest of us the hair. it obviously doesn't belong to anyone working, but because we didnt technically have proof so we couldnt really do anything.
their food comes out and we make sure everything is good, and it is perfect! so s takes them their food. about 10 minutes later they call over s and says that their food is too burnt and they need another one. it starts getting busy so s gives me their check and asks me to take it to them. i walk over and give them the check.
ed2: *looks at check* are you serious?! we've had horrible service and we still have to pay full price? 
me: i'm sorry. i was just told to give you the check. 
ed2: well our server was gossiping about us(when she got up and was listening. i knew she was lying) and wouldn't give us a new appetizer. our food was burnt and we barely saw her!
me: i'm sorry ma'am. let me go talk to my manager.
i find one of the owners and let him know what was going on. he goes and talks to them and ends up giving them the entire meal for free.
going to the future... the daughters come in a few more times, each time getting a discount or free item. i'm completely done with them. the last time they ever came in was the worst. they ended up cussing at their server, who was new, so i went and told the other owner everything about them and what they've done. she goes and talks to them and they cuss her out too. then my boss makes a face, which i never ever want to see again, and tells them that they are not allowed to come again.",ShrimpyShark,tfys
852,"similar to hollywood, tipped employees receive abundant sexual harassment in the workplace","this was an article that i found and honestly kind of interesting. restaurant work is the only work i’ve ever really known so i just thought this was the norm everywhere. 

[article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/psmag.com/.amp/social-justice/sexual-harassment-at-restaurants-is-sky-high)


edit: interestingly enough as i was reading more, sexual harassment is actually higher in the food and hospitality industries than it is in even hollywood and politics. it’s actually the highest out of all industries. 

edit edit: might as well include my experience of this throughout the years i’ve been in the restaurant industry 

i used to get called jailbait when i was under 18 from guys in the kitchen to the point ( all very much older than me ) where sometimes the kitchen manager would have to tell them to stop. this was when i worked in the kitchen because i wasn’t old enough to serve. 

the rest is now going to be from my experience as a server. 

i’ve had customers say some strange stuff to me. one old guy kept talking about how cute i was and how he wanted to stuff me in a suitcase and take me
home. i tried to avoid him as much as possible because the comments were constant. i had a guy once kept talking about how hot i was and then laughed with his friends saying he was glad he wasn’t at work because he couldn’t get in trouble for sexual harassment. 

i had a manager once who said dirty comments to me at work all the time and to other young girls who worked there. he would make a comment on how he wanted to fuck or make out with one of us and then yell at us later if we made a mistake. he ended up finally getting fired when the one girl took a screenshot of him asking for threesomes. 

i had another manager who would take girls phones under the pretense where he needed to see their work app and then disappear with their open phone for 20-30 min at a time. he did this to me and joked about taking dick pics on there when he had it. 

i’ve seen customers literally ask to be sat in a new section so they could have a “hot server” when they saw they had a male server. 

one time i had a customer refer to me as the girl with the nice tits when he told a busboy he needed another drink. 

i’ve had male servers tell me in the middle of my shift on how they wanted to fuck me without me even bringing such a conversation up. 

there’s plenty others but these are just the ones that really stuck out to me. ",bobluvsburgers,tfys

854,"burn my hand on hot metal, my gm has me keep working","*quick background for this story: this happened about 3.5 years ago, when i had just turned 17. it wasn't my first job in food service, but it* ***was*** *my first job as a server, and i had been working at this high-end restaurant and bar (easily $$$+ rating on google reviews) for about 4 months at this point, and i quit less than a month after this. the restaurant had also switched management shortly before i was hired on, and shit was going downhill hard and fast, losing servers by the week.* 

now on this particular night, i was fucking exhausted.it was the beginning of my senior year of high school and i was holding this job in addition to a fast food job and trying desperately to not fall into depression. i'm only telling you all this so you can get a feel of *exactly* how out of it i was on this night.

in the midst of what was probably my 50th trip back to the dishwashing area to drop off dirty dishes from expo (because we hadn't had any bus people on staff since i started this job, so it was all on the servers), there is suddenly a huge metal pot sitting on a wheely cart partially blocking the small entrance to the area that hadn't been there before. of course, my exhausted teenager brain is like *'nah man, all good. just roll it aside a bit with the back of your hand'* and i fucking did. it was full of grease (which i, of course, had not considered), so it was heavier than i had expected and wound up having to pause to push harder with the back of one hand. it took a split second before the pain started, and my hand was on fucking fire. i almost dropped the dishes i was holding, but somehow managed to put them on a counter before straight up sprinting to the nearest sink. 

i'm standing there, hand under the water, crying (not from the pain, mostly just exhaustion), and the gm fucking walks up and asks why i'm not out with my last table of the night. i'm fucking speechless for a second before telling him, tears still pouring down my face, that i've just burned my hand on a vat of hot grease. and you know what he fucking says?

""squeeze some lemon on it and get your table their tab."" before i can say anything, he walks away to keep helping close down the place. i'm dazed and confused at this point, and desperate to keep this job. so, i take 2 minutes to poorly wrap my hand using our very, very old first aid kit, and take my table their tab.

my hand is shaking as i give them their tab and clear their empty plates, and i'm pretty certain my eyes were red rimmed and my face was red and puffy, as it usually is when i cry even a little. this sweet couple asks if i am ok, apologize when i tell them i've hurt myself, and leaves me a pretty nice tip. 

they leave, and i am desperate to go home and let my dad take care of my burn and my boss literally tells me to *soak my hand in milk* (not fucking kidding) and then continue helping close. it's super late at this point. 

now, i actually have had a full thickness burn before on my right foot, which is still heavily scarred with severe nerve damage, and i know for certain at this point that i'm going to wind up with blisters at the very least. i am so overwhelmed and painful at this point that i seriously just start sobbing, full on, as i get the materials required to start rolling silverware.

after rolling silverware for a half hour, everyone else working is just super disturbed at this tiny teenage girl with snot running down her face as she rolls silverware with one hand. finally, the bartender (that night, a close friend of the gms from high school and a guy who's sort of looked out for me from the out) convinces the gm that i'm not even being helpful anyway and that i should be sent home. when i call my dad, he comes out to pick me up immediately.

i quit less than a month after this, and within 3 months after that, the place was out of business. good riddance, even if i do miss the food.

**tl;dr-** accidentally burned my hand on a metal vat of hot oil, was told to suck it the fuck up, and cried inconsolably as i worked until they finally sent me home.

855,using your eyes: how to tell which restaurant you walked into for beginners,"so i used to work at outback steakhouse and this couple walks in at one of my tables.. they rack up about $100 during the hour they spent there. when i came with the check they hand me a $75 longhorn steakhouse gift card and a credit card. i very awkwardly informed them they were at outback. now looking back on it, when they walked in the owner opened the door and said  “welcome to outback” and the hostess said  “welcome to outback” and the first thing i said to them was “welcome to outback” and they ordered from outback menus with foods like the outback center cut sirloin and there are australian decorations all around the restaurant. i guess what i’m saying is, context clues are important.

update:
 realized everyone wanted to hear the outcome. i told them they were in outback and we all laughed about it. i felt bad and even asked the manager if we could take 10% off or something. they paid in full and tipped 25% in cash (any good server knows cash is key).",silverhammer96,tfys

857,you guys need better customer service! we were nice the entire time,"ok, a little backgrounds story for you all, keep in mind this is my first time posting on this site. i work at a long john silvers in the town that i just moved to for college. its a nice place, food is always good and the staff is always nice and since i know a thing or two about fast food i got the job.

they always pester me about how slow i am and i am working on getting that fixed. now to the story, this about the third month of me starting and i knew what to do very well since i learn a few things very fast, its sunday so we do our all-you-can-eat special that church groups really like, especially since it is pretty cheap and the food is always cook to order. now i work the night shift so i do see some weirdos from time to time so it doesn't surprise me on the people that walk through our doors.

until ""they"" walked in.

it was a couple at least in their late 20's the girl looking pretty skinny and the man looking like trash, dirt and cuts in clothing, along with a scruffy beard.

i ask them how their day was and proceeded with their order

m = man

me=me

w=woman

me: hello how are you?

m = can you tell me about all you can eat?

i tell him on how the all you can eat works and he looks at his girlfriend trying to figure out what they want.

m = is it possible to get both? (we only had fish and chicken all you can eat available)

me: not at the moment but my mangers are trying to push that option

m: are you serious, just give me a #1 then

he ordered a $9 platter all you can eat is a dollar cheaper

he got mad and then the woman orders she orders the fish combo and i gave them their drinks and told them that it was gonna be a bit since the food was cooking, apparently they didn't like that as they had that look of discust on their face.

their food was prepped and i handed it to them, then the lady says this:  
w: hey! this is wrong i ordered the chicken

me: i am so sorry i will fix this right away.

my manager was at the fron and heard this and got me the chicken that the girl wanted and the man comes up

m: miss we can keep the fish if that is alright

mgr: i already took care of the fish. (she threw it away since they touched it)

he sits back down and i can hear them say how shitty our customer service was and how the manager was loud, which she was from time to time, and rude, she isn't rude.

about 20 minutes past the guy comes up asking to speak to my manager. i told him that she was out in the shed at the moment looking for some paper towels since we were out but i will get her as soon as she was done.

she comes in and i told him about the customer up front she goes up there and this is the following conversation.

mgr: hi what can i do for you?

m: yes i just wanted to let you know that you guys need to work on your customer service, it is just downright awful the way you guys treated us and the way you came out and talked to us isn't acceptable at all.

mgr: umm. i never went out into the dining room once.

m: well that kid did and he really needs to work on his stuff, i am a manager at mcdonald's and i would enfore my employees to be more cheerful to customers

mgr: well maybe we will come down and see ya then

at this point he left with his gf, without purposely leaving their stuff on their table for me to clean. i learn from the cook that he use to work for that guy, always done threats, smoke weed, and was an almighty lazy ass. hearing this me and my manager were just laughing about it the entire time, it was such a funny thing to happen and we still joke about it to this day.",FirelordWidik,tfys
858,not understanding allergies,"so this happened a few years ago but it still baffles me that this conversation took place.

i used to work as a night shift team leader at a smoothie shop, basically i was the evening manager. all my coworkers at this time were high school age while i was about 22 so we all looked really young which meant most of our customers were pretty nice to us and we made ok tips. 

one of my newer coworkers was taking orders while i mixed smoothies and handed them out while taking payment. 

this couple who had been staring at our menu board for a solid ten minutes finally went up to her and started asking every question in the book that related to dairy and anything that contained any kind of milk or general dairy product. 

now our store had a strict policy on working with allergies. as soon as we heard the word allergy, we were to freshly and thoroughly clean one of the blenders and we would not touch anything that related to the allergy. it saved the customer any problems and it kept the company clear of any possible scams.

they were the last to order so i went into the back to clean a blender. two minutes away, at the most. i come back out to the couple looking angry and my coworker looking panicked. 

the conversation went like this:

me: hello, what seems to be the problem?

the guy: i have a severe dairy allergy

the lady: he can’t have anything with dairy!

(they ran that circle multiple times telling me ten different ways that he couldn’t have any dairy. basically i couldn’t serve any yogurt, ice cream and half of our health powders.)

me: that’s fine! we use water as a base and can easily avoid that!

now at this point i’m confused and my coworker is just looking exhausted, defeated. i can tell by her face this is going to be good. 

the guy: well then why did she tell me i can’t order the (greek yogurt style smoothie)

me: sir.... while greek yogurt contains less dairy, it is still a dairy product and since you told me of your allergy, we cannot serve you that. we could make something similar but it won’t contain any yogurt

he and his wife then proceeded to yell about how this was horrible service, how they always get yogurt smoothies at other places, and generally berating us and screaming about how he just wanted a greek yogurt smoothie!

by the time they finished, i was done and my poor coworker looked ready to cry.

nothing much came of it. since i was the manager on duty i just kicked them out of my store for harassing my coworker and put a ban on them, though it wasn’t real since i didn’t technically have that authority.

we had cameras so everyone knew what they looked like to make sure to avoid them or just kick them out. 

not sure if they were trying to scam us for a freaking smoothie or if they just didn’t understand our policy or their own allergies but either way, i’m so glad i never have to deal with greek yogurt man again.

859,finally got my wtf moment in serving.,"i often read people’s stories on here of some of the most absolutely absurd things customers do.  while i’ve had many many moments where i just want to shake the shit out of customers.... today was the day where i was like...... all my time reading everyone else’s stories on reddit have prepared me for this type of situation. 

let me try and give you the run down without running on. 

brunch- slow for 3.5 hours, 1table. then in the span of 30 minutes, the bar, the restaurant and the patio all get sat with multiple tables. i’m the only person on. i have a busser and that’s it.  now, i’m a strong server and bartender but even things like this are overwhelming. 

i probably got 10 tables and an 8 top in the span of 20 minutes. in the next 10, i got 6 at the bar. plus i have to make all my own drinks. so yeah...

8 top called earlier to make a res. said it was her husbands birthday. no mention of catching a flight.  they get there at the res. time, i’m already getting busy. i get their drinks. they instantly tried to go into ordering food. i had to stop them and let them know i’m just doing drinks first. i have like 4 other tables i have to get drinks for and i hate that.  i mostly hate it because it’s usually one impatient a-hole whose ready to order but no one else is so you spend 5 mins bouncing around the table because everyone keeps saying “skip me, i’m not ready”.  i don’t have time for that. in 5 minutes, i could do drinks, menus and orders for non douchey people. 

  anywho..... they get their app. they have drinks. they are fine. kitchens backed up. nothing i can do about what’s happening. it’s just getting busier. to highlight how busy it was, my sales were almost $1800in  a little over 2 hours. 
painting a picture yet :)

i knew i was going to get help soon. next person was on their way. 

while this 8 top was now waiting for their food- which yes, it’s taking a while but again, there’s nothing anyone can do but keep going forward. the son decides to ask me how long on the food, i let him know the kitchen got a little backed up but it would be out shortly.  i also now have relief. i’m cranking out drinks in the bar and he comes back again and says that they are in a hurry because some of the people in the group have to catch a flight. a flight!!!! wtf!!!!
why would you make a reservation for 8 people at brunch, in la on a sunday, tell me it’s for a birthday and then wait til after you’ve gotten drinks, ordered and got an app to tell me someone has to catch a flight! ahhh..... how bout fuck you- you should’ve led with that! 

my relief tells me after he left that it was kind of rude of him to say it like that and why is he saying it now. also, we are about an hour away from the airport. so double fuck you.  

anyways, they were becoming impatient, then they finally got their food. the crazy ass mom with a “can i speak to your manager haircut” tells me her eggs aren’t cooked right and became instantly upset. i apologized and say i will have it fixed right away. 
then the daughters food was incorrect. which i get, sucks.  i’m not the kitchen but i sure get blamed for their mistakes. but also the kitchen is just as busy and again.... what can you do besides keep going forward. 

i tell the kitchen, they are fixing it. i go back to the table, she’s now telling me that they don’t want it. i told her it’s almost ready and that if she would like, i can box it up. she doesn’t want that. after she had previously told me she wanted a new sandwich. when i repeat to her that the kitchen is almost done she snaps at me and says “they aren’t making it. i know they are not!” like... b*tch! how the hell do you know what the kitchen is doing? you’re outside, they are inside and your not in the kitchen. don’t tell me what part of our job we are or aren’t doing.  the more irate this woman gets, the more her family thinks it’s acceptable to add on to it. now the daughter wants hers comped, she’s complaining, husband is souring, son is now complaining about some bs. the mom then says all of its unacceptable and terrible and they waited an hour which then turns into 2 hours... and yada yada yada and the whole bill should be comped. seriously wtf! you want me to comp over $250 in food and drink because of a fucking sandwhich! get bent.  i tried my best to remain calm and i said the best i can do is for the food that was not made correctly since not everyone had that problem with their food.  and there was nothing wrong with the drinks. 

everything was a pity party about her inconvenience. she had to so adamantly point that her daughter was pregnant without her food (which they were already remaking) but was such a selfish bitch that she didn’t even care how she was treating me and i’m pregnant! obviously pregnant. 

so let me get this straight..... everyone should stop drop and roll for your pregnant daughter but you don’t give a f* that i’m running my pregnant ass off and having to deal with your sh*tty treatment???!  i’m beginning to see the cracks in this woman’s life.  and she knew i was pregnant. we talked about due dates. her husband was in the day before and asked me about my pregnancy. 

the son chimes in that there is no excuse that it should’ve taken that long and that it’s not even busy. i firmly but nicely pointed out that it in fact very busy. as you can see all these tables outside, there’s more inside plus people at the bar and i’m just one person who is trying to do her best. 

nope. not what they want to hear. 

i took off about $50+ from the bill and told them that was the best i could do since it was just the two meals that were the issue and that i couldn’t comp the drinks since they were already consumed. so while i didn’t comp the whole thing, i took off 3 meals in total. 

it gets better. while i was inside dealing with everything and trying not to let her take me down during all of this, i guess she decided to go off on my co-worker who just got there. she was trying to help me and she herself was getting slammed. right as she walked in the door.  

  i guess the crazy ass lady was so horribly mean to her that a customer had to step in and say enough is enough. you’ve made your point. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
wtf is so wrong in your life that you treat a pregnant woman and someone who isn’t even your f’n server in such a disgusting way?!? 


and she wasn’t done. she yelled at both of us that she was calling the owner. which she did.  which i know has to suck as an owner or manager to get a phone call from some irate lunatic. their first reaction is to assume it’s the servers fault. now you have to retrace your steps to see if you handled it well, if you made the right call, where you overreacting, was she in the wrong? 
but the fact that she dragged my coworker into it, she treated my busser like crap, the customer had to tell her to chill...... reassures me that this is not normal unhappy customer behavior. 


so there you have it reddit- my very first wtf-are you kidding me- is this a medication induced outburst, moment. 

and honestly i’m proud of myself for doing that much in sales in that short of time at 30weeks pregnant and keeping it as cool as i could. if you have ever been pregnant- it’s the greatest thing in the world because you realize you have no more patience for stupid shit so you will call people out on it and not feel bad. it’s part of that self preservation that comes with being a parent. but i just love it because i won’t take crap from anyone anymore.  i just have to make sure that i don’t go full monty on a lunatic customer with a shitty haircut.  why does her attitude have to match her hair. 🤦🏻‍♀️",Mayor2018,tfys
860,selling liquor is no joke,"about a year and a half ago i was doing a volunteer bartending gig for a couple of friends trying to raise money for something or another. the state i live in is very strict on liquor laws with huge fines for serving after 1:00 am. once it hit 12:45 we called for a last call and had a quite a few come up and ask for drinks, we busted as much as we could out and at exactly 1:00 we stopped serving booze even though there was still a line. people were upset and started to complain but all of us behind the bar new we didn’t care because nobody wanted to lose their licenses. after the line of whiny people left around 15 minutes later one last guy came up and says “can i please get one last shot of vodka??” i said absolutely not we are way past the last call mark and i don’t need to lose the ability to serve. he starts saying some stupid shit like “come on nobody is looking i’ll just pound it fast and nobody will even notice”. i leaned and said “i’ll tell you what. you pay the fine for me serving you this shot and i’ll give it to you. after you pay that you’ll also supplement my income until i can get my liquor license back after 2 years. pay my rent, buy my groceries, pay to support my hobbies. you do that and i’ll gladly pour it for you”. he chucked a little not quite sure if i was serious or not. i just gave him a blank stare and watched him go back to his buddies and start talking shit. i don’t give a fuck bud this is my livelihood and i’m not risking it for your 1.5oz of some shitty vodka.

&amp;#x200b;

she came in yesterday during our slow time, around 3pm. over the last week i had thought a lot about how to approach her if she came back. i decided not be confrontational in person as i didn't want her to leave a bad review.

after greeting her, i asked her what i could do for her. 

hun: yeah i left a contest box for a free facial here and i am back to pick it up. if you don't have it anymore, that's ok. (i think she knew how shady she was being and felt bad, which made me feel better about going easy on her)

me: oh, let me look in lost and found (nope, not in there, we threw it away)

me: have you contacted the owner? he might know something about it. (i reach over the counter and grab my own business card and hand it to her. i'm the owner, there's a picture of my and my family on the wall right behind her.

hun: oh no i haven't, i'll be sure to.

me: i hope you have a great day and come back to eat!

if she called me, i was going to be the ""owner"" to her and keep getting confused, asking her if she was wanting to pay me to leave a box, and how much she was offering. i was never going to acknowledge the original box. i figured it would get the point across without attacking her personally. she seemed like she already knew it was a bad idea to stealth drop the ""contest box"".

it's not exciting, but i think i made the right call in how to approach it. i don't think her life would have improved if a random restaurant owner jumped down her throat. the fact that her opening line included ""it's ok if you don't have it anymore"" told me that either her other boxes have been getting thrown away or she has/is coming to terms with how messed up it is to try to market at other's real businesses that we pay out the ass to sustain. restaurants aren't cheap, and our customers trust us to provide great food and service, not be tricked into giving up their contact info to mlms.

865,plz advice me,"so i work for a corporation with multiple restaurants that treats their employees very well. but i had a table on friday i took too long to get them limes (i was triple sat and took orders before getting these damn limes) and the customer told the manager. once i got back he let me know he was a chef for the same corporation and he could tell i was “half assing” my job.  he let me know he’d excuse it for now but i needed to do my job the right way (my blood was absolutely boiling at this point). they only got a few appetizers, but continued complaining to my manager the entire time. once they got to the end of their meal they had the table transferred to another server, and proceeded to let him know they weren’t tipping because he didn’t do anything. 
i continued to stay as professional and composed as possible through all of this and i hope my frustration can be seen. my question is should i contact hr or possibly his restaurant and let them know what happened? if it was any other customer i’d blow it off, but it’s frustrating that someone in the same industry even the same chain of restaurants would walk all over a server like this.  please let me know what a safe play is for me my managers literally did not care.

i work in a pretty well known restaraunt in my city this sunday evening. all is well despite the agonizingly slow flow of customers but it's fine just give me more time to do closing shift side work. 

as i walk out from the kitchen/server area i see a group going into our golf simulators we have in the restaraunt with no drinks in hand so i think ""maybe i can try and squeeze in some last minutes before im cut off the floor?"" so i approach them, brother and 2 sisters have a reunion-ish thing after 4 years. super cool so i chat with them as i ge there drink order and appetizer order, ring it in, and then let them do there thing after a little more chit chat after i drop off drinks.

i bring out the nachos and let them munch for a bit, do my 2 minute check back and then grab another round. when i get back with their drink they decide to play water(beer) pong. no biggie. i help get them set up and all of a sudden they ask me if id like to join them in a game. usually id decline if i had other obligations but i would just be watching espn till my shift was over so i figured why not? better then being bored.

they end up being super cool seattle born folks who just got funnier every drink they had (they were ubering dont wory folks) after me and the brother beat the sisters with one cup them 2 cups us they were ready to head out so i went got their check (s/o to gentlemen brother for picking up the whole tab lol) i come back to get my merchant copy before i see them off and he tips 20% which is cool as heck! especially since i got to hang out with thwm.

then he reaches in his pocket and pulls out a 50 and 10 euro bill and hands em to me. said to take it to my back and they would exchange it which is cool plus sid never felt a euro bill. not much else after that just wanted to share my unique experience(:

tldr; guest returns from france recently and gives me his leftover euros plus a decent tip. then we play beer pong (me and bro beat the sisters btw lol)

edit: can anyone tell me where these bills are from in the europe or iftheyre standard currency. he said he got them in france

867,so i blew up on my manager tonight after she expected 25% of my tips,"gonna keep it short and sweet as possible, but our foh manager that currently makes $13/hr constantly takes tables from myself and the other server/bartender (she believes that we always need to be rotating with her). it does not matter what day of the week and how busy or not busy it is; if i take a table and another table gets sat she will take it because we should rotate with her.  

anyways, tonight, i had a private party i was bartending for about 30 guests. expo was running food so i was obviously going to tip out her, but after the event was finished and i printed out my server report my manager told me i needed to tip her out 25% because she ended up carrying two plates to the event. i basically told her to fuck off and i wasn't giving her shit and that its actually illegal for her to do that. she stormed off and told me that i needed to talk to the owner about it.  

a few minutes later i caught her talking to the owner (very obvious what it was about given her body language) and she left right after. at the end of the night when the owner was giving us our emv tips she mentioned if i was going to tip out anyone, to which i replied i was going to tip out expo. she made no mention of my altercation with the manager nor hinted at any wrongdoing/possible punishment on my end.

868,why i quit my job at boston pizza,"hey everyone, this story happened about a year ago or so but i just recently found this subreddit so i thought i'd share it with all of you. (i'm on mobile so sorry for bad formatting)

i used to work in the kitchen at a boston pizza in my town, i hated every second of it. most of the managers and supervisors were idiots and have more stories about them for another time. 

but let's get to why i quit,

i was working on a tuesday night and it's usually not that busy but it got super busy tonight. i was the only one on the prep line. for about an hour i was doing okay. i messed up on a pizza. one of the supervisors i liked was working. he told me what i did wrong, said don't worry about it and just make sure i do it right, even take a little extra time to make sure. 

20 minutes go by and the supervisor i hated comes to my station and asks what's taking so long for orders. i tell him that i'm doing the best i can and i want to make sure i don't mess up. he tells to go faster than i can. 

i start going faster and fuck up on a couple more things. the same supervisor comes back and tells me to stop fucking up and to go faster. 

at this time there's 20 items on my screen and i'm starting to get really bad anxiety and i'm starting to sweat to get everything done. 

the supervisor comes back for a third time and the conversation goes something like this
a - asshole supervisor
c - co-worker
me - yours truely

a: what are you doing?!?
me: i'm trying to get these orders done
a: why the fuck is it taking you so long?!
me: i'm sorry, i'm doing my best, i don't want to screw up
a: well get these fucking orders done now!
at this point i start crying and hyperventilating and begin to have a panic attack
me: i'm trying to, i need some help
a: for fuck sakes, [co-worker], get back here and help [me] because he obviously can't do this himself.
me: i'm sorry, i'm trying my best
c: hey man, don't worry, let me help you with this
me: thanks

we eventually got everything sorted out without any issues. i took a break in the bathroom after we finished and broke down for about 10 minutes. after my shift i talked to my manager but they didn't really do anything about it.

the next day i called them and told them i quit and i haven't been inside that boston pizza since.",SP3LLICUP,tfys
869,"i don't understand, can i get a coffee?","this happened pretty early into my time spent working at a small kiosk type thing set up next to a popular tourist spot in my town. for context, it was in ireland, where english is the native language. i am irish. i do not have a particularly strong accent and this is the one and only time anyone had trouble understanding me.

i was approached by a customer on a somewhat busy day, and could tell by his accent he was american. i'm not super familiar with american accents but if i had to guess i'd say boston. it went something like this.

customer: hi, can i get a coffee?

me: sure, what kind of coffee would you like? americano, latte, cappuccino, or...?

c: i don't understand, can i get a coffee?

me: uh, sure. do you want just a plain, black coffee? (i intentionally spoke a little more slowly and loudly, as clearly as i was able, since i've been told i talk too fast on occasion by coworkers.)

c: i don't understand what you're saying. can i please get a coffee?

it was at this point my manager basically pushed me out of the way to take over, and since we had other customers to deal with i didn't listen in on how that went. my manager's accent is noticeably closer to the irish stereotype than most people i know, though, so i can't imagine it went well.

blue collar workers tend to be great tippers, from my experience. last night, for example, two guys in blue coveralls and work boots left me $30 on $70. 

at the end of the meal in question, one of the women, the one who'd been the most loud and playful of the bunch, covers the whole check. i'm happy, thinking her friends would be leaving me tips too, since they got a free meal, though that doesn't always happen. 

when i hand her the book back, she crosses through the tip line while i'm still standing there, laughs and says to me, ""you know how it is, girl! money's tight. gotta save where you can.""

are there some dynamics here that i'm missing? this just seems straight illegal while the 2 hour breaks seem to be used as a band aid pr statement. if employees were supposed to be getting 2 hour breaks on overtime shifts why would they even schedule overtime shifts? why not just do 8 hour shifts and avoid the inevitable blowback? it feels like they just mentioned that we ""should,"" be getting 2 hour breaks but in reality you can never take them as the restaurant always gets busy enough where you can't realistically take off for a straight 2 hours.

874,"*advice needed* how do i respond to a 1 star review by a ""we encourage small businesses"" couple","~~sorry for the long post,,~~

a white couple maybe in their 40's came in around 7 on a packed friday night to our small family owned mediterranean restaurant. they seemed fairly normal so i let the newest girl take them. a short order a kabob trio ($15.95 *a sample plate that comes with a chicken, beef, and steak skewer, rice, a choice side, pita and garnish*) for them to split and an additional full order skewer of the chicken kabob ($5.95 *that comes with pita and garnish (however note: all the meat is cooked to order and the chicken kabob most time consuming item to cook on the menu that takes at least 15/20 minutes to cook thoroughly*))

there was about 5 orders ahead of them and they're getting antsy about 15 min after their order they continuously asked her where their food was, she had informed them that it would be another 10 minutes or so, 5 minutes later they told her that they had a soccer game to go to and that they were in a hurry so i went to the kitchen and saw that the kitchen was beginning to plate their order so i told her to tell them another couple minutes or so, as i was walking out of the kitchen with their food they were still nagging on when their order would be out.

when she had given them their plates he looked at his meal with dissatisfaction demanding that there's supposed to be more meat on the steak skewer, she was confused and worried and sent it back to make sure his food was correct, the kitchen was confused as well saying that we only give two cubes on the steak and to tell him that his order was made correctly. she informed him that this was how the plate is made with 5 cubes of chicken 2 cubes of steak and a long kofta (beef) skewer, he told her no that he had gotten 4 pieces last time he was in here and that she was wrong.

i could see that she was uncomfortable so i went to speak to the couple. he said that we had not given him enough steak, when i began to inform him that that the plate was based on weight and everything is pre-weighted and cut accordingly, but he kept cutting me off just repeating ""no"" shaking his head ""no"" not letting me get though a single word. he then said he was supposed to receive 4 cubes and that he had pictures (however he never bothered to show me), i tried to respond with ""i'm sorry sir but this plate has never been served with 4 pieces""  he continued to treat me like a child repeatedly telling me ""no"" in-between all my words and a final ""we're just not coming here ever again""

i went to talk to the kitchen about the situation but what could they do we were slammed with orders and they were just trying to keep up, not having time to talk to these loons. i looked over to them and it had looked like the woman was beginning to eat her meal but the husband had said something to her and she had stopped. they asked their waitress for the bill and when she politely asked them if they would like us to box their meal with which he arrogantly responded ""no i can't eat my meal out of the restaurant,"" and on top of that they then got mad at their bill because they assumed that the full order of the chicken skewer ($5.95 *however we accidentally charged them a $1 less at $4.95*) was the same price as the small order of chicken breast ($3.95) that is an add-on to a large salad, in which their server explained to them that that price was for a small meat addition to a salad and that the chicken breast is different compared to the chicken kabob in which he said he was ""disappointed"" and was ""never coming back in again."" i mistakenly decided to check on them and to see if they would like a togo box or drink not knowing that they had been already asked, he said ""no we're never coming back again,"" again and i said ""alright sir"" and decided it was best to just let this sad couple leave.

they paid. they left. no tip of course, and their plates untouched (except where the woman had tried to eat her meal.)

for people who act like they encourage small businesses they don't seem to understand how hectic and stressful it is to own a small businesses.

now let's dissect,

&gt;returned to the location today for dinner; expecting to enjoy a great meal. floor was filled with young kids serving. service was subpar at best. it took 30 minutes for the food to arrive. my wife and i ordered one plate to share. very simple meal, the kabob trio. rice was stone cold. i only received two small pieces of beef and was told that it was weighed correctly...

1. i know most people assume i'm around 16 but i am not a kid, i am f in my 20's. thank you for discrediting your waitresses because you assumed our ages. and even if your servers are young adults who are you to expect to work at food establishments.
2. 30 minuets is not a long wait time for a packed out restaurant on a friday night especially at a small business, if you were in a hurry why didn't you inform your waitress she would of told you that the kabobs is most time consuming item in the entire menu
3. the kabob trio is not simple it is three different types of meats that are all prepped differently and have different cook times (and you ordered and extra full order of a chicken skewer)
4. and your food was weighed correctly, if you truly had that picture of 4 cubes why isn't it in your review for comparison? also our normal steak plate ($15.95) comes with 6 pieces of steak, how are we going to give you more than half that order that plus a chicken and kofta skewer for the same price of 15.95????
5. and we had zero complaints about the rice that entire day it might of gotten cold from you refusing to eat your meal for 10 minutes and running your plate back and forth, however you never brought it up in house...

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the wife of the owner was sitting right next to us. she saw everything happen; she said and did nothing.

this man loves to make assumptions because this part is frustrating.

that night so happened to be the night that the owners' sister and elderly mother had came to visit the restaurant. they had just come from the middle east about a week or so ago. his sister has nothing to do with the business she is merely a guest and on top of that a guest who has very limited english speaking capabilities!!! he just assumed that it was his wife when his wife was actually in the kitchen the whole time helping the kitchen staff. what would he want her to say! the fuss that they were making probably caught her attention but she was completely confused on what was actually happening.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;we encourage small business and want the small business owner to win. when you give service like this with food quality this poor i fear i might see them on a episode of gordon ramsey kitchen nightmares....

no, no you don't. 

you acted like you owned the place and didn't bother to eat a single bite (except for the rice unless you made that up) you probably knew not to eat it and still pay for the food so you could look good when you write it in your review

the food and service quality is not poor because the last time you were in here, 4 months ago, you had given us 5 stars

you're not cut out for encouraging small businesses if one unfavorable night is enough for you do a complete 180 and say you'll never come in here again

not everything is a reality tv show, this is a family's livelihood their only source of income and it's only a nightmare when people like you come in

&amp;#x200b;

**now heres the oof.** **i've been asked to write feedback to their review since the owners are stumped and worried to say something that could possibly make things worse and are not the most comfortable with writing in english. however i am way too emotionally attached to this instance. what would be the best way to respond to sound professional and not hot headed? i just know how just one negative reviews has a much larger impact than any positive review and i don't want people to scroll by and see that the owner had nothing to say to a ""valued"" customers' complaint.**

**what should i say?**

875,21 year old cries because i couldn’t serve her a drink without her id.,"another long weekend in the books (almost). time to share the most memorable interaction. 

i’m bartending at a family restaurant known for burgers and fries without bottoms. a younger girl and her father take a seat in my section, so i greet them and ask what they want to drink. one sangria for the dad. one margarita for the daughter. i ask for both id’s, which i generally do if one looks young, even if the other is obviously middle aged. they both laugh and i think it’s because i asked for his id, but it’s actually because she doesn’t have hers on her. the conversation goes: 

girl: i left it at the hotel across the street. i guess i can go get it. 

me: yeah, you could do that. i’m sorry. i can’t serve you without it.

girl: *proceeds to show my picture of her passport on her phone* but i have a copy of my passport here!

me: no, i’m sorry. i really need it here. i can’t serve you without it.

she mumbles ok and just asks for a water. i go to get their drink and notice she leaves, so i’m assuming she is walking to the hotel to get her id. great! now i can serve her a drink when she comes back. no problem. wrong i guess. 

she comes back with a sudden attitude change. i greet her again and she shoves her id towards me and said, “here’s my id,” in the most rude tone. everything checks out, and i hand it back and tell her happily that i’ll get it started. she snatches her id back! i honestly didn’t want to serve her anymore and was very close to not getting her a drink, but i did anyways to not cause trouble.

then comes the good part. i hear her dad snip very curtly, “watch the attitude!” he had to say that to his 21 year old adult daughter! she then started bawling. was crying as i set her drink down. was crying when i brought them their food. and she honestly didn’t stop crying until they left. it made for a very awkward rest of the night. 

honestly, i wish i didn’t serve her. someone with that maturity level shouldn’t have a drink in their hand. i know maybe some of it had to do with her dad snipping at her, but the tantrum before that showed that wasn’t the sole cause.

anyway, 18% tip. dad was nice. wish the girl stopped crying. goodnight.

876,to the couple that dined and dashed - a letter.,"shame on you.

&amp;#x200b;

shame on you for trying to find anything and everything to complain about to get your meal and alcohol comped.

&amp;#x200b;

i handled and fixed every single complaint you had, but magically another one would spring up.

&amp;#x200b;

i would not comp your meal because i was onto you. i saw how you stammered as you shifted your eyes around when you tried to complain about your service even though your food was just delivered and i (the manager) just refilled your waters.

&amp;#x200b;

shame on you for saying how much you hate this place and always want to stay away because the service is bad (then why are you here?) don't worry, i pulled the camera footage from your visit tonight. i saw how you swindled me for free alcohol. luckily for me, i had an off the clock server eating in your section and she watched your every move as i went to take care of your complaints. if i was not an active floor manager you might have gotten away with the service comment, but alas, i know what goes on in my restaurant as i am always doing walk-a-rounds for every cycle of customers including drink refills for my customers. this restaurant is my life and my soul.

&amp;#x200b;

shame on you for trying to say your sake wasn't even full and only got 2 shots out of it when i saw the cameras as you happily drank more than 4 shots - the full serving of liquid contents.

&amp;#x200b;

you complained that the sake wasn't out quick enough so i gave you another on the house with no questions because it was the correct thing to do. as i brought your hot sake to your table, i watched you take a sip to ensure your satisfaction. you said it was perfect and began to eat.

&amp;#x200b;

i saw on the camera footage how you discussed amongst yourselves once i left and how you began to throw a scene in my restaurant. how you loudly demanded a manager again while flailing your hands around. i walked back to your table and you slaughtered my server, you shit on her in public saying the is the worst server ever and no server at my restaurant was good? did you know the tables around you actually pulled her aside and said she did nothing wrong and was doing a great job? don't worry, if you were looking for an audience, you had one.

&amp;#x200b;

you said other servers were talking about you - did you know no one knew anything? they were talking because you were yelling in my restaurant acting like a fool. your dining partner even started to cry and said how horrible the service was and it ruined your entire experience here - when i said i would give you a discount and a coupon for next time, her tears dried up instantly.

&amp;#x200b;

don't worry, i heard her little quip she said about ""not being able to afford the food"" (verbatim) as you quickly silenced her by yelling over her voice how awful the service is and how ""fucking shit"" your server was, your words, not mine.

&amp;#x200b;

what i did, young sir and ma'am was give you $5.00 off your meal, two free large hot sakes totaling $9.00, and a $10.00 future voucher because you love doing to-gos at my restaurant because you hate the service. that was a total of $24 and yet when you saw the check, you slammed it on the table and said ""she only gave us $5.00 off"". yeah, my server heard that too. no, what i gave you was a total of $24 in concessions which were clearly outlined on the bill.

&amp;#x200b;

i saw how you stood up, waved your arms around - and walked out of the restaurant without paying your bill when you ate your food. i took pictures of the table, don't worry, i also followed you out the restaurant but you know what, i stopped myself because i had a restaurant full of honest, truthful customers that i needed to take care of, so i let you walk.

&amp;#x200b;

i'll be here if you ever make another to-go order or decided to show your face again. you are going to love when i show up to take your drink order.

877,customer mad over change,"for the first time in the three and a half of serving at this restaurant, a customer made me cry. 

my first table of the night was a couple. i was extremely friendly, got them waters and menus within 30 seconds of them sitting, suggested beers that would pair well with their food, and gave them samples.

their food came out on time, beers were replenished quickly and i checked in on them numerous times. i can easily admit there are times/instances where i am not an a+ server, but this wasn’t the case.

when it was time to close then out, the man gave me $100 bill for a $70.23 tab. 

i brought him back one ten dollar bill, two fives, and nine one dollar bills, along with his 77 cents. 

i dropped off the change, thanked them for coming in, wished them a good night and went about my shift. a minute or so after i dropped the change the man called me back over.  a= asshole. m=me

a: i just wanted to ask you a few things. first off, you shorted me 5 cents. it’s not the money that’s the problem it’s the principle. (it probably slid off the clipboard we use for receipts on accident). also, i wanted to know why you gave me such small bills back as change. it seems to me like you’re fishing for tips that you haven’t earned. 

m: i’m so sorry sir, the nickel might’ve slipped off the clipboard while i walked over. i’ll go grab that right now. also, we typically give small bills back for change so that you have the opportunity to tip whatever you’d like and aren’t forced to leave a large bill if that’s your only cash. i’m happy to get you bigger bills if you’d like.

a: yeah it’s not the money i’m concerned about, it’s the principle. you shorted me 5 cents and then you bring me small bills expecting me to tip you. i’m having this conversation with you so that i can understand why you’re doing that. 

he proceeded to lecture/question me while his girlfriend giggled like it was a funny inside joke. i have never had a customer talk to me in such a condescending way. my face was beet red and customers at my other tables were starting to turn around and look at me. 

after about two minutes on lecturing and me trying to explain and apologize, i realized that nothing i could say would make him happy. i told them to have a good night, walked to the back and started crying. 

it probably seems like such a minor encounter but it really hit me hard to have someone imply that i was trying to “fish for tips” just by bringing small bills. and as a young female college student, having a man condescendingly talk to me like i’m a complete idiot/attempting to swindle money from him was really shitty.  

i keep checking yelp, facebook, and google reviews to see if he writes anything about me ‘fishing for tips’.  thanks for ruining my night asshole. ",elanma,tfys
878,update to the bus boy who makes a tip per hour,"ok so i talked to my manager, and she said that i get 4% of tips and if the servers are feeling generous they’ll give me more, also i’m apparently supposed to get my tips weekly and i’ve been getting them biweekly for the past 2 months, and i get the same amount. also i get paid minimum which is 11

this week i got paid $39 in tips , and i worked 5 nights. atleast it’s now weekly, i’ve already applied to some places but i don’t know if i should follow up still. i’m still extremely jealous of my friends who make my weekly tips in one day. do i stay or look for another job?

879,this one definitely ranked in on my top 10 rudest guests,"warning. this is terribly long. i'm a writer at heart. if no one reads this all, that's okay. just glad i found a safe place to rant about all the nitty gritty details of the server life to people that *really* understand. think of lemony snicket while you're reading and that should help set the tone for this story.


i was triple sat as soon as i clocked in tonight at 6. our wait time was 2 hours. we were **packed**. and the kitchen staff must have been feeling more care-free than usual. ticket times were reaching 50-60min. i walked into total chaos.


the first table that was sat was a family of 3. a man, a woman, and a girl 8-10 years old. they all seemed to be in good moods. my greet was *spot on*. i take their drink orders while my 2nd and 3rd tables are being sat right next to them. i stop by those tables and because tables are so close i'm able to tell both at once, ""my name is ____, and i'll be taking care of you all this evening. check out our drinks on the first page of the menu. $1 off bottled beer tonight. i will be right back to get those drink orders!"" i go grab the drinks for the first table and get their appetizer order. all of this has happened within 2-3 minutes.


i get drinks and appetizer orders for my other tables. take orders for my first table, ring it in, table 2, ring it in. grab table  1 their appetizers. get them drink refills. run to the bar for the man's 3rd beer. everything is going swimmingly until my orders start coming up.


i know here i don't have to explain the wait time for a rack of ribs compared to a salad. but we all know that the population outside of the restaurant business won't understand that no matter how you try to explain it. usually because of *but-i-was-here-first* logic.


although they *were* seated first, table 1 had ordered menu items that take longer to cook than the other tables. so i run food to those other tables. as i was bringing food out i explained to table 1 that their food shouldn't be much longer. i've been checking in with all of my guests. no complaints. table 1 got some more drink refills and enjoyed their appetizer.


at the time, 2/3 of their order was in the window. i was just waiting for that ticket to be sent at this point. i see the 3/3 item hit the window. **unmistakable**. kids mac meal with a side of mac... granted we all love mac n cheese, but this kid was *preeetty* weird, but that's a whole other story.


i ask expo about selling the ticket, start to grab my food and expo tells me not until ticket sells. so i tell expo to tell kitchen to sell the ticket then. we aren't allowed to directly communicate with kitchen staff especially during a rush- only through expo. kitchen tells expo they are looking for the ticket. i'm like what the fuck do you mean **looking for the ticket**. this is a good time to mention that during this dinner rush our kitchen was a chaotic hell fire and our kitchen staff genuinely does not care. at. all. i tell expo to get my damn ticket (***please***) and head out to tell my table that their food is coming right up.


they are visibly irritated. i get it i *really* do, they were here before my other tables, who already had their food, and made a point to throw that in my face. i apologize, promise them their food will be fresh and hot and that i will be right back with it.


run back into kitchen and kitchen starts claiming they had a technical error and my ticket disappeared. bs. i guarantee my ticket got bumped instead of sold like so many others tonight but unlike the others mine went unnoticed. expo finally lets me take my food. the plates are so hot from sitting in the window that i had to layer bev naps under them just to carry them to the table. i'm about to walk out of the kitchen as another server walks in saying ""hey your table ___ is complaining"". *great*. so i grab the manager who is currently on back line. make him carry one of the blistering plates and come explain the issue to my table with me.


we get to the table and the man is irrate. the woman and the girl both stayed quiet. the guy continued to trash me no matter how hard my manager politely tried to protect my great reputation. ""other people were getting their food there's no way it was just *our* table that was affected by a technical issue!!!! it had to have been **her fault**"". that's the pg, long-story-short version of how he dogged on me for about 5 minutes. he also complained about the plate being *too hot* to have been sitting back in the kitchen like we claimed. just wow. although i did agree with him about the technical issue and was frustrated with my manager for using that as a lame excuse, of course i didn't bring that up until closing with said manager. this man clearly had no idea about how a restaurant works behind the scenes. definition of ignorant. i'm sure his plate cooled down by the time he was done verbally abusing me indirectly.


i continued to check on that table like i would any others. i apologized for them waiting and for the complications. he told me he didn't want to hear it. i told them to enjoy their meals and to let me know if they needed anything else. as i walked away the man scoffed at me, ""yeah. the check. now!!!""


i doubt any of you fellow servers have forgotten that **i still have other tables**. i was deep in the weeds. throughout all of this i was still trying to keep my composure and give my best to my other guests.


after an internal pep talk, i bring him his check. i decide that i'm going to try one last time to reason with him. this was a fire burning inside of me. i walked up with a smile and i said, 

""sir, i pride myself on being an honest person. if it was my mistake that caused you to wait so long for your food, i would have admitted that.

i wasn't *hiding* in the kitchen from you.

i was trying to get the ticket sent that i *must have*

to bring you your food that **burnt my hands**

because it had been sitting in the window

and *that's* what caused the plates to be so hot

because they sit under heating coils in that window.

so i apologize about the mistake that was made back in the kitchen, but i respect myself too much to let you slander my character like you did without defending myself.""

it felt better and better with **e v e r y** word. he said nothing and handed me his credit card. i brought him back his card and receipt slips. i left a pen even though i *knew* he wouldn't be using it unless it was to scribble out the tip line all together. he of course left ----$0.00--- in the tip line. no surprise.


my other tables tipped me very well, especially the ones who witnessed this guys behavior. so atleast i didn't have to basically pay for that asshole's meal because of tipshares. the rest of my night ended up being one of the best saturdays i've worked in a long time. but worst of all...

he **took my pen**. i felt *so* victimized over the pen. i know he did it on purpose. the whole situation was just ridiculous. a serious *what. in. the. actual. fuck.* moment. but i think if it hadn't been waiting too long for food, he would have found another reason to complain or not to tip. i don't think i will ever not be frustrated because of that guy and all of the other guests out there like him. the end * takes bow *.",mrsmamaeverhart,tfys
880,why i still hate large tables of women and kids...,"this is from over twenty years ago but i remember it like yesterday. 

i was 18 serving tables at a resort town in central oregon. 

a giant table of women came in with an equal amount of kids. we all groaned. resort women are notoriously the worst. 

i volunteered to take them and vowed to make them happy. i had four younger sisters and got along well with kids, anyway. 

so all is going great. kinda are coloring. moms are chatting. i’m keeping the hot chocolate and wine glasses full. they women compliment me on my service. 

it’s time for the bill and a younger woman takes it. 

before they leave i make one more play for a big tip and package up to-go hot chocolates with extra whipped cream for the kids, who were going ice skating. “you’ll need these to keep your hands warm!”

they thank me profusely and leave. 

so i open the tab and there’s nothing inside. mind you the bill was $200. 

after clearing the table i find a crumpled up $5 amongst the plates. so a 2.5% tip. i’m pretty bummed but figure something good will surely come of it. 

later that afternoon i’m having my shift meal outside on the heated patio. 

i see the woman from earlier approaching me. fuck. 

“hi,” she says. “we were here earlier...?”

“i remember you.” [keeps eating]

“oh...okay well when everyone was dividing the bill my mom tried to give me some money for hers and i think i left it on the table...”

[silence]

“...you may have thought it was a tip...”

[awestruck silence]

“so.....”

[finally pick my jaw up off the floor] 

“are you asking me to get up from my meal, go into my personal wallet and give you $5 of my money?”

“yes...”

“and you’re comfortable with that?”

“i mean, we don’t believe in tipping...”

i grabbed my purse, plucked a crisp $5 from it and handed it to her, with the sweetest smile i’ve ever plastered on my face. 

and then i whispered “go fuck yourself, lady.” and walked back inside to finish my meal in peace. ",Lourdez01,tfys
881,people....,"i've been working in restaurants for my entire life. i'm 30 now and a manager. which for the lurkers out there that don't work in restaurants means i took about a 20 thousand dollar pay cut, because i wanted more responsibility. 

but with all my years in the service industry, it's amazing how i am still surprised by how vile, obnoxious, aloof, and down right dumb people can be. 

fast forward to saturday night service. started slow everything picked up around 8 pm though, so staff was in good spirits. kitchen was flowing great. guests were drinking and being merry blah blah blah. 

get flagged down by a gentleman at a 6 top (all in their 50s or so). and he says to me (guy is g, i am m)

g: hey, i just want to say everything was really good. food was great, the atmosphere is great, service was good. but the food took a little long. 

m: thank you, i understand. it was one of those nights when everything kind of all happened at once. 

guys awful wife: we were here before everyone else.

(quick aside. i have a solid understanding of the pulse of the restaurant always. i was a server for 12 years. so i look at tables constantly, this includes checking in on the pos system to gauge where they are at and communicating with my server team. the whole nine yards.) 

m: i understand that but you had you starters and ordered food around the same time as the other guests. (knowing full well that this was true and that there was a whole fish with the entrees. which is a guaranteed 30 minutes or so...even if no one is here.) 

g: i understand it happens. 

m: thank you so much, we always appreciate feedback. and the goal is to always make sure that everyones needs and are met in a timely fashion

so i leave this interaction feeling mostly positive. i can definitely help control the vibe and the level of service. sometimes things take some time...nbd.

walk by the table 30 seconds later. and a different gentleman flags me down. he will be d.

d: so are you going to edit the bill?

m: i'm sorry sir, what do you mean 

d: because of the terrible service we received?

m: (gesturing towards g) we just had a conversation about this. i thought the service was great and the food was great.

d: well things took a while

m: i understand that, i just apologized or that. 

g: (being a bitch) i was just speaking for myself

m: i'm sorry, i just don't understand. i know things took some time but i was under the impression that it was mostly positive 

d: (literally flicking his wrist to shoo me away) ok. fine. bye. 

m: sir, i'm happy to have a conversation with you about this.

d: well most managers....nevermind bye. 

like a fucking toddler. they were 6 people that sat at 7:30. ordered their apps at 8. entrees at 8:30 (when the restaurant was full). then dessert after being fully cleared. this conversation happened at 10. 

and to be honest, the only i wish was different was that he finished that most managers comment. because i would have replied ""most adults pay for their food"". 

and just so everyone knows, i take great pride in not being one of the most managers in a restaurant. these simple minded cheapskates, don't know how it goes. that yes man manager gave you a discount and then reamed out a 22 year old. fucking people

882,i want the order i payed for!,"so this happened last night on a mcdonald's night shift. we are the largest and busiest restaurant in the city and over the weekend we get all of the people going out.  

so, it's around 1am, we are super busy with the orders, when two girls, visibly drunk come to me at the till and demand completely new food (a huge order i mind you), since one of them dropped 1 of the burgers on the floor. i tell her that we can get the burger replaced, but not the whole order. she gets instantly angry and demands to speak to the manager in charge, so i call him over. 
 
he proceeds to speak to her, but it was useless as she suddenly got very violent. 

screaming ""i want the order i payed for!"" she threw her whole, gigantic takeaway bag in our direction, it hit the ceiling and the food drinks and especially the damn slushie went literally everywhere. the fries, most of the foh staff, my shirt was all covered in coke. 

she walked off, struggling to keep her balance.

883,most children made the job worth it.,"i have so many fond memories of children in my sections. one in particular was a young boy who was maybe ten year old. i was serving him, along with his parents, grandparents, and his three other younger siblings. i served them during a more slow time at the restaurant, so i was able to interact with the family a little more. i loved this sweet family. 

when i brought them the check, i said my goodbyes. as they left i noticed not only did the parents and grandparents tip me 10$ each, but the young boy had written me a note, saying he had a bad day of school. but that i had made it all better, so he wanted to give me him allowance. now it was only three dollars, but i had to take a moment in the back to compose myself. the kindness of that one little boy will forever stay with me.",wantallthedogs,tfys
884,10 years as a server and i got my first allergic reaction tonight.,"i am usually quite serious about allergies, to the point that even though our menu is nut-free and soy-free i always verbal, write it on the ticket, double check, mention cross contamination for gluten, etc. after 10 years i’ve dealt with every allergy imaginable and never had an issue. 

tonight my head wasn’t fully in the game and i had someone come up to me (i work at a food window at a bar, so no table service) and order wings, fries, a salad we had as a special and pasta. we don’t do pre shift meetings so the specials are usually just printed on the menu with their ingredients and we do a cursory glance when we come in because it’s a really laid back neighborhood bar. as he ordered the pasta he mentions there is a nut allergy and i reply that the pasta has some nutmeg, which he says is fine. i wrote it on the ticket, gave the cooks a verbal and didn’t think anything of it because our menu is nut free. i bring the food out and a few minutes later the same guy comes up, concerned, and asks if the salad has nuts. the color drains from my face because i realize it has walnuts, which is the first time in 2 years i’ve worked here an item has them. the cooks look at me and go “we thought the allergy was only for the pasta”. he asks us if we can remake the salad, that says it’s fine, but he’s obviously pissed. 


apparently his wife (with the allergy) had some but was able to take some medication and when i came over profusely apologizing and explaining i refunded them their money they were extremely nice about the whole thing and thanked me for being so professional because they had seen me tell the cooks about the allergy and knew it wasn’t my fault. i, however, still went back to the walk in and cried about it while googling if you can have a delayed allergic reaction.

i’m still in shock i made such a serious mistake, and i’m so grateful they were so nice about it. ugh, i feel terrible. ",Allergyfuckerupper,tfys

886,"""oh, you thought you were about to lock the door! hahahaha""","it's about 4am, and i just got home from working late night at my biscuit shop. i'm so fed up with obnoxious drunk people and am seriously beginning to hate my job. honestly, tonight was good overall. customers were nicer than last night...until the final customers. 

we close at 2am but can't officially close until everyone has left. the store cleared out at 2:05, so i went to lock the door when this guy runs in with his friends (two girls and 3 guys, i think) and says something along the lines of ""oh, you thought you were about to lock the door! hahahaha."" we were sold out of some things, but they ordered whatever we had left and hung around being their stupid drunk selves. i had been stamping coffee sleeves at the register, and one of the guys grabbed my little stamp from the counter and stamped his chest with it. i asked him to please give me the stamp back, but he wanted to be funny and stamped his friend's chest while refusing to give it back. i continued sweeping around them and working on what closing duties i could do with customers still in my way. they left at 2:15.

i wish i could focus on all the good customer interactions that i had, but i'm so frustrated. not just from tonight, but all the shit i've been putting up with. i cleaned up a stranger's vomit two weeks ago. last night, i had to deal with an obnoxious guy chasing one of my employees to ask him about steroids (???). these people are assholes, and alcohol only exacerbates the problem. as a 21-year-old woman (working late night usually with two other 21-year-old women), i don't want to deal with this.

i know there's more to my frustration than just the drunk people. my superiors are being difficult for multiple reasons. i'm not getting the hours i need. i'm trying to move but can't save money right now as i'm only making enough to get by. i'm meeting next week with the owner of a new restaurant that is opening, hoping to pick up some hostess or server shifts. i'm excited about that but know it's going to be hard on me as i'm finishing up my last semester of college while already working full time. sorry for being so depressing. life is just kinda shitty right now, and i wish i enjoyed my job as much as i used to.",NerdBird49,tfys

i work at a restaurant that turns into a nightclub at 10pm. tonight we had a comedy show, so setup was going a bit different as we had to clear the whole floor before putting chairs out. as we are in the process of setting up a visibly drunk woman (maybe 40ish) comes up and asks where all the chairs are. i explain that we're doing the set up at this moment and there will be chairs shortly. in the meantime i invite her to sit at a table towards the back. 

as i am saying this, she yells at me ""why does everyone here look underage"" and then proceeds to run both hands over my cheeks while telling me how young i look. i immediately stop my sentence and say ""please dont touch my face"" as seriously as i can. her friend quickly pulled her away. 

everyone i told at work seemed surprised that i asked her not to touch my face and i told my manager who made sure she wasnt served any more drinks but didn't kick her out.  i'm not sure i have an end to this post other than that, i was more writing just to share it. any thoughts are welcome.

it was about mid morning, or around 10:30-11:00. a group of three girls (who appear to be 20-22, and are wearing t shirts from one of our local colleges) pay and are sat in my section. now all three are buried into their phones when i go to greet them, and therefore have no idea what i look like. (to keep it brief on my appearance, i’m 5’5, caucasian, and with a so called “dad” body due to a slight gut i have, this is important)

i go to greet them, and the following interaction happens. m: me, cg: college girl

m: hello! i’m mcdubstep21 and ill be..

(all three raise their head, with cg smiling and suddenly stops smiling as she turns her eyes and looks at me)

cg: (cuts me off, while giving me a look over at the same time) can we head on to the buffet? 

m: absolutely! i’ll have y’all’s drinks ready by the time you three get back! enjoy!

(i had noticed her looking over me, but didn’t think much of it at the time)

now the rest of their meal goes fine, but as time went on, i noticed they seem to be discussing about me, every time i went to serve or greet another table, all three were either looking at me and back to each other, or were outright staring. however as soon as i came by to check on them, they would be fine or ask for refills, with typical thank you, etc. but with some odd looks that got more odd the more they ate.

now they are finishing up and are gathering their purses....when cg calls me over

m: was everything good? does anyone need a to go cup for drinks?

cg: no, we’re fine....but can we ask you something?

m: sure! what’s up?

cg: how much do you make in tips?

m: that depends to be honest, on a four hour shift, maybe $50-$75, and on a eight hour shift around $125-$140, but serving isn’t my main job, i actually host here most times.

cg: really? you make that much? well that’s not surprising considering how you look

(the vibe immediately changes like grease lightning)

m: how..i look?

cg: yes, don’t you see?

m: what’s wrong with how i..

(cuts me off for the second time)

cg: that! (pointing to my slight gut)

(i’m completely shocked)

m: excuse you?

cg: i don’t meant to offend but you would probably make more tips with a better built body than what you have, i have friends that work out like crazy and all they have to do is slightly flex and all the girls tip like crazy! 

(now all three are smiling, and nodding in agreement)

m: (in my head) are your friends strippers?

m: i.......will....consider....that....thank you (i feel my face get red as a beet and am flustered as can be)

cg: i’m sorry, just trying to help you, since you seem to be struggling making money here! have a good one!

they stiffed me on a $75 bill, wasn’t surprised after that stupid show they put on.

i, for the first time since i’ve started working here, was left very embarrassed, if not slightly upset. though i quickly composed myself and went on with my day, i remembered that the joke was on them and i make good money regardless of how i look. come to think of it, i think they were trying to find an excuse not to tip..oh well.

oh, i ended up making $75 on that four hour shift ☺️☺️☺️☺️ ‘tis was a good day in the end!

889,"screaming doesn’t work, let’s try sexual harassment!","not my table. but hoooolllleeeee poop. 

work at a chain. last night was uncharacteristically slow. as in, our late night happy hour was practically nonexistent. at the time this happened, there were 5-6 other tables, a handful of bar regulars, most servers had just been cut and were eating or doing side work, and down to a single manager. right now, our kitchen is so, so fucking green and our the usual guy who knows wtf he’s doing took the night off because it’s his birthday. 

server will be dawn, because that’s her name. dawn is an older woman. kind of crazy, like older servers often are. she has a table of 3- a couple, and their teenage daughter. guy gets shithammered or came in drunk. not really sure which. they get apps, and while waiting on their food, dawn notices they’re trying to leave. being the crazy bitch she is, dawn confronts, threatening with the police. guy starts getting loud, manager intervenes. 

manager is ally. it’s her first night closing. baptism in fire time, i guess. 

they are at the computer, and guy is still loud, to the point where i’m sizing up my few male coworkers and send one over. he’s saying he should only have to pay $35, when his bill is around $70. he’s claiming they’ve been waiting an hour for food, but when detailed, the food has been ordered for 47 minutes, and it’s been at least 15 minutes of arguing. plus apps. he’s trying to talk ally in circles, trying to get more and more free shit. 

when screaming at her doesn’t work out, he starts rubbing the small of her back, saying, “i bet your boyfriend doesn’t touch you like this.” mind you, his wife or whatever and kid are right the fuck there. his wife just calmly is like, “don’t do that” 

eventually, their bill is comped to their liking, and they leave. on their way out the door, the wife grabs the cheeseburger dawn abandoned on a halfwall while stopping them from eating. just big, messy burger, in hand, out the door. while muttering under her breath about how we’re all talking shit about them. 

ally goes and cries in the office. 


aside- police should have been called. like, immediately. where the family and manager were arguing is where all the damn phones are, and i think everyone was just kind of in shock at all of this.

890,"don’t wait to be seated, enjoy the hot coffee in your crotch","i worked at a really busy breakfast place.  we had the normal “please wait to be seated” process most breakfast places have.
part of my job was to go around every couple of minutes and make sure everyone’s coffee was full.  
right in the middle of our rush, i see a guy in his mid 30’s with a young baby in his arms just walk right past the hostess and sit at a two top.  the guy just had the baby, no bag of baby gear, no seat for the baby, just a rookie unprepared dad and his one year old kid.  seating himself messes things up, and cuts in front of someone that’s probably been waiting for 30 minutes.  in this case though it was a bigger problem because the guy didn’t have any seat or carrier for his baby.  part of the hostess job was to make sure kids and babies had appropriate seats, but this guy skipped that part.  his plan was just to hold the wiggly baby in his left arm, while eating with his right hand.  good luck.  it wasn’t my job to police the customers, and to me a table was a table.  so i go over to the guy and he says he wants coffee, good news i have an extra hot fresh pot in my hand. so i pick up his mug, fill it up and put it far enough away so wiggly baby can’t reach it.  then i tell him i’ll be back in a couple minutes to take his order.  i walk two tables over to fill someone else’s coffee and end up facing the unprepared dad and baby just in time to see the dad take a sip of coffee and set down the mug right in front of him on the edge of the table.  in the same motion wiggly baby also puts his hand in the coffee and jerks back, dumping the full cup right in the guys lap.  i’m just stuck there in shock watching this unfold. the baby didn’t scream, the guy didn’t make a noise. he just got up and walked out. 
looking back, the weirdest part is that no one but me saw this whole thing unfold, and the whole chain of events probably took 45 seconds to unfold.  he walked in, i filled his coffee, he set the cup down, and he got a lap full of lava and walked out, so fast that the 3 of us are the only people that knew it even happened. i told my boss about it just in case the guy came back, but he never did.",hemlock57,tfys

my two other servers quit with me and it was beautiful. the place was awful to their employees and expect more of them even though they paid basic minimum wage. seriously the one sushi chef they had was there around 12 hours a day 7 days a week. poor thing he's only 23. 

i wouldn't take any of my cash tips home, and i noticed on my time card they miscalculated my hours on one or 2 days.

they treated their employees like shit and i was doing above and beyond and to always be threatened to be fired. i have more to say, but it felt good to quit. my only worry is i need a new serving job.

any tips for finding a new job? how should i report them as well?",waluigismistress,tfys

895,"“i wanna talk to the owner, where can i write a review?!” “i’d recommend yelp.”","watched my owner shut down a table yesterday and tell them to leave. so nice. 

so i’m covering a hosting shift at a tequila bar on national margarita day, and there’s like a 45/hour long wait for deuces starting at 6 pm, and even longer for big parties. 

a lot of tables were staying for a longggg time. i’d tell guests they could get drinks at the bar while they waited for their table, which is what most guests ended up doing. 

there’s a two top right near the host stand that’s closed out that’s been there for two hours. their friends at the bar, who were not waiting to get a table, run into them and decide to join them. so they become a 4. now these other two decide they want food. mind you they decide the best way to do this is to complain to anyone near them within earshot, “be nice to see a *server* around here.” my you the server has not been by this table in 20 minutes because they’ve been closed out and we’re waiting for them to leave so we can flip the table. 

eventually their server figured out what was going on and so my assistant manager walks over and pulls up a chair and sits down with them and very politely explains how many other guests are waiting to eat and how if they want food they can go order at the bar. 

well they did not like this. the one woman storms up to me at the host stand and goes “who do i talk to about a review? i wanna write a review i’ve got a few thoughts about how we were treated.” i smile and go “we’re on yelp, check us out there.” she huffed off. 

like fuck off lady, you and your friends. i get it, it’s a restaurant, you want service. but have a little awareness of your surroundings, sheesh.

897,i don't understand people who fill out receipt surverys with great remarks and then tip badly.,"our restaurant has a section at the bottom of the credit receipt for you to assign a value between 1 and 5 for food and service(separately). many time i will get all 5's or a written in 10+ awesome service and then they leave 10%. or the opposite, they act super nice, tell me food was delicious and have no issues to only go and circle a 3. i wish we just had a blank spot for a comment instead of a score because when i have to explain anything less than a 4, i look stupid telling my boss, ""uh i have no idea, they said it was great and it seemed like they enjoyed everything"".

i think it would be more helpful to the restaurant of they are too afraid to say something negative to me, to write out a complaint rather than a numerical value.

900,teenagers,"i (18) host at a chain breakfast place, i started at this location about three weeks ago but was have been with the company for about two years. there have been only two other instances that have made me as angry as these kids did. 

we had a group of five teenagers come in during the middle of our lunch rush on our ‘get a free slice of pie when you buy something day’. i sat them at the only available table big enough which also happened to be in one of our most experienced servers sections. i get them drinks and she serves them. they say everything is great when both she and our gm check on them. she even split their check when they asked which the servers don’t normally do since they got other things to do and it’s a lot easier for me as the host to do it. cue the two girls coming up. cg= cash girl dg= debit card girl gm= my gm and me will be me 

me: asks how their meal was and if they got their free pies

dg: we needed the checks split so me and him (points around the corner behind me) and her and the other guys were together but our server messed it up. 

me: oh let me fix that for you what did you need on each check?

cg: i’m paying for the *restaurant special that is basically a choose your own four things* with the crepes on itand the burger and two hot chocolates

dg: i have the skillet, the *other restaurant special which doesn’t have crepes on it* and all the side orders

me: okay if you could just look these over for me and make sure they are correct 

both of them: yeah these are perfect 

i ring them up and they go on their way, easy least right. they seemed happy, albeit a little surprised it cost more than fast food. and i covered my ass by getting confirmation right? wrong

not two minutes later they come back up 

dg: i was charged for this side order of crepes but cg was supposed to pay it. 

me: i don’t have access to change any of that but let me get my manager 

gm who happens to be walking over to us cause he has some sort of spider sense: what seems to be wrong. 

dg: both your server and she messed up our tickets and charged me with the wrong food, cg was supposed to pay for the side of crepes. i only have $15 in my bank account now because she overcharged me 

me: (thinking if $5 makes so much of a difference that day after you say you got paid you have other issues) explains that when cg told me the special with crepes i put the special that had crepes in it on her ticket and when dg said she had all the side orders i put the side order of crepes on her ticket. 

gm: i’m sorry but since you paid with card, company security regulations don’t actually allow me to change any card info once it’s been processed so we can’t do anything for you. 

dg: this is ridiculous 
she storms back to the table 

cg to me before following dg: thanks for trying to help 

dg left her receipt on the table and scratched this place sucks into it and subsequently our table with i’m assuming her keys. no tip for my server, who said high schoolers are always a 50/50. i was pissed but figured kids will be kids. 

but wait there’s more 

this 14 year old diva decided to call corporate and complain that we charged them an extra entree, and demanded she be reimbursed the entire check.  my gm and district manager laughed that case out of existence quickly but still, if anything else, she confirmed the ticket before she paid and the amount while she was paying, as did cash girl. there were at least three instances they could’ve said wait this isn’t right before the card was processed,  but they didn’t.

902,"""what would you do?""","it was 3:00 pm on a tuesday. i'd just been cut, it was slow as anything, and i had one last table. my targets? four middle aged ladies. when i came over to introduce myself, they giggled the whole time. yeah, a little off, but it was a pretty standard interaction otherwise. i got some drinks and brought them out to the table. they ordered a few appetizers... everything was going great. that is, until i got the food order. i took it all down, said, ""i'll get that started for you."" and a particularly chatty woman said, ""make sure it's right.""

i thought that was a little weird, but i shrugged it off and assured her i would make sure the food came out perfect. i checked on the table a few times through their stay, and they kept giggling like crazy and looking around the restaurant wildly. it was weird, but you see a lot of weird stuff serving. no big deal.

i brought the food out on my shoulder, and oh my word, the women looked so nervous. one told me to be careful as i set the tray down. older women do that sometimes, and it's kind of cute... a lady once tipped me extra because she was so amazed i could carry ten drinks on my tray without spilling them. but these ladies weren't amazed, they were scared. i laughed it off and made a joke that their food was in good hands, passing it out accordingly. i asked if they needed anything else, and there were four things. mustard, ranch, napkins, and a glass of water. i said that i'd be right back with it, but the same lady stopped me. ""are you sure you can remember that?"" she asked. ""you should probably write it down, honey."" 

okay, at this point i started getting annoyed. i forced a smile and assured her i would be able to remember it all. i went to the back and told my coworker how annoyed i was. like this table thought i didn't know how to perform the basic functions of my job??? he thought it was hilarious. 

anyway, i brought everything back and they all acted so freaking amazed i remembered everything. ""wow!"" one lady even exclaimed. alright, whatever. ya'll enjoy your food and stuff. i went to the back and finished up my cut work while they ate.

when it came time to pay, they asked if they could split the check, then the one chatty lady told her party, ""oh, no, that's probably too complicated for her...""  

""it's not too complicated. i split checks all the time, it's honestly no trouble."" i swear i was trying so hard to be polite. in any case, the woman told me how to split the check, and again, they were amazed i could manage the feat. 

i cashed them all out, brought back their books, and wished them a very nice day. the looks on their faces were so strange. i tried not to be awkward, but one lady stopped me from walking away and asked, ""wait... where's the camera?""

context: i've been told a lot that i look like taylor swift. i don't personally think so, but i guess if the lighting is right and i throw on some winged eyeliner, some people can find me strikingly similar. so these women explained to me that they thought i was taylor swift and they were on that show ""what would you do?""

905,quick rant about tipping out management,"so i work in a mid-high end restaurant as a server. every once in a while, our bartender may not be in, so the owner or the manager will sub-in. we work on a 1% tip out for the bartender usually (we add 1% or 2% if we have a runner and/or busser). at every other place i've worked, the manager and owner are not given a tip out if they do this (because, you know, it's illegal...).

last night, the owner was bartending. he's a generally cool guy, but at the end of the night, i was tipping out, and after i did, he goes ""oh and i just need that 3% from you."" this was a day where we had no runner or busser. i was shocked. like, it almost felt like he was demanding money from me. if i said no or protested, i'd have probably been fired.

i already know the recourse for the event, just wanted to rant. it definitely discolored my opinion of him. after talking to other servers, that is apparently a common occurrence when they bartend. like, i am paid to peddal his shit, and he's demanding my tips? girl. messy.",do_meth,tfys

907,thanks for the tip,"
i used to work with a catering company specialising in outdoor marquee weddings. one wedding i remember in particular was in the grounds of a mansion overlooking miles of countryside. the wedding attendees were obviously loaded and most of them spoke like they had a plum in their mouth.
anyway, i was serving from arrival of guests all the way to the bitter end. a particular group of women were demanding extras from me throughout the day, despite me telling them there were strict allocations for the amount of food and drink they could have. this went on all day and after we’d finished coffee and put the equipment away, they asked me to bring some more out just for them.
i was monumentally pissed off with them at this point but i went above and beyond to please. one of the women in the group ushered me over after i’d given them their extra coffees. she asked me to hold out my hand, i thought; “ oh great a well deserved tip for these bullshit incessant demands”
she then put an old cigarette end in my hand. “could you get rid of that dear”

908,"why yes please, complain about my coworker while i'm right there","i'm a server at a diner-esque chain restaurant known for our burgers and milkshakes. 

since we don't serve alcohol, it opens the door for some of us young 'uns to serve for tips. 

i was finishing out my shift today. i was off the floor at this time and just bussing and wiping off my tables. 

my coworker tiana (changed name) is a fellow minor server in my same grade. she actually got really excited today because she had sat a five top that included her cousin that she hadn't seen in awhile. 

everything seemed alright, tiana was managing her several tables quite well and the shakes come out alright.

when she brought out the food, however, i overheard that one of the patrons (not her cousin) had ordered chili cheese fries and there was neither chili nor cheese on the fries. 

upon seeing this, tiana does the natural thing to do in service and telling him that she knows he was supposed to have chili cheese fries and that she'd be right back with the corrected plate. 

she runs off to not only fix the problem but to go on the line and personally ensure this is done. as i'm wiping my table in front of the five top, i heard the guy who had the messed up order loudly complain about the mistake.

""she knew that order was wrong before she when brought it. if she knows and relays the order, then it's not the cook's fault if they mess it up. it's her job to check before running the food.""

should tiana have double and triple checked the food before running it? certainly. but she did rush off to immediately correct the mistake. 

i was tempted to say something to them about being aware of who's nearby or to outright defend tiana, but i decided to hold my tongue in case i were to dash whatevers hopes of a tip she had for that party left. 

i told tiana afterwards as a semi heads-up, but other than that there really wasn't a resolution. i had left before the party had so i'm not even sure if or how much she got tipped.

909,worst financial restaurant you've worked for,"how have you been screwed over through a restaurants stupid policy when receiving your paycheck?

&amp;#x200b;

i once worked at a korean bbq place and they had the regular state/federal taxes (i believe the taxes together came out to be around like 24% or something, based in ga). on top of that the restaurant instilled a 4% tip out (1% hostess, bartenders, bus boys, and head servers). what's dumb is the fact that the 1% tip out to busboys was 'fake'. every restaurant i work for, i make an effort to get to know the dishwashers and busboys. i had asked this one busboy, alex, if he was still receiving $500 a week working 6 days/12-14hour shifts, and he said he was still getting the $500 a week. needless to say, that 1% went to either the owner who averages \~$1.5m a year on this one location or to the manager.

on top of that, head servers were exempt from the 4% tip out, but they received 1% from every server working. 

tip out as a whole was reflected on total sales rather than e.g. bar only receives 1% from alcohol sales. 

i had a paycheck that came out to be $12xx before taxes and i was only able to deposit \~$6xx.

called out today of the place i've been bartending + serving for about 3-4 months. the manager first gave me crap for calling in day-of and not finding anyone to work for me yet, and then 2 demanded i bring in a doctor's note (which is not illegal it is just ridiculous imo for trying to crack down on ""fake callouts"" vs. demanding it for anyone ever to miss a day, let alone for customer safety). i work 1 night a week and every third sunday. the place is medium-upscale, a real townie place, but i haven't liked working there at all. i'm in grad school and this is supplemental income but i've just about had it and was going to give my notice in a few weeks anyway. perhaps i am just bitter about having to go to a doc to justify taking a couple days off, but i am really tempted to just call it a career.

concerns: i always give notice. i've worked professional jobs as well as short-term restaurant and retail jobs and i always give notice. not doing it feels awful, as i know it will be a burden on the other staff in the meantime.  i also am concerned this will have repucussions in the future, even though the intersection with this restaurant and my future career won't ever meet.

finally, since i believe this is the flu, i dont expect to be non-contagious for a few days. so i'll have to call out tomorrow as well. it also feels like if i dont produce a doctor's note regardless, they'll fire me. i'm whether thats legal but thats the sense i got, nothing explicit was said.

one couple calls after they receive their food and it apparently arrived to them cold. i apologized and asked if they would like me to send them a whole new order. they declined because it was late for them. they were very nice and understanding and said they would just warm up the food. so i said i would send them coupons in the mail for two free medium pizzas anyways. she agreed to and was happy with this and thanked me for them. 

later on, as i was closing, i look at our email and we had received an unsatisfied survey response. i opened it up to read and it turns out it was the people that i had promised free coupons for! she stated ""while they offered to replace our order, we declined and nothing was done to resolve the issue."" bitch what......... so she spoke to me on the phone, was apologized too, is getting two free pizzas (with a value of more than her whole order) and she's gunna come up in here to fuck up my survey numbers???? bitch i don't think so. i was going to drop the coupons off in the mail box on my way home but i decided they can wait a bit for their nothing coupons.

913,"crazy old man lies about the tip he gave me, twice","okay so i work in a shitty little sushi place that is more known for all you can eat then exceptional food or service. i'm the server that's been there the longest and the closest thing to a manager besides our actual ""manager"" that's never there, plus the sushi chefs which act as managers when ours is absent. it's a funky dynamic, but it pretty much works for us. so essentially when someone asks for a manager i am the one they answer to, because the chefs don't speak a lot of english. 

i had this weird old man come in for to-go. he immediately asks for a server i'll call a. 

me: ""a isn't working tonight, but i can help you!""

crazy: ""it's your lucky day then.""

me, internally: oh boy. 

he makes his order, pays with an $8 tip (still generous for a to-go, but i am now wondering why it's my lucky day), then says this:
""i'll be out in my car. a usually takes care of me."" 

okay bro. whatever. 
his order gets made and bagged and sits in the pickup area for a while. 10 minutes go by and i'm wondering where this dude is. we get a little busier and i forget about him for a bit, guess he went to do some errands or something. 

20ish minutes since his order had been sitting, he comes back into the restaurant looking pissed. he was giving me a narrowed-eyed, pouty bottom lip sort of look, very obviously. with his eyes locked on me. i said something along the lines of ""your order has been ready for awhile!""

he was flabbergasted and said ""then why didn't you bring it out to my car?? i gave you a $28 tip!""

we don't bring orders out to cars. especially when it's busy and i have a lot of other things to worry about. i told him he never asked me to. 

crazy: ""a is going to hear about this. he will not be happy when he hears how you treated me today.""

(a is just another server and i have seniority so this was funny to me.)

 he didn't even break his freaky ass gaze as he left the door; he turned around to keep glaring at me as he shut it. my friend and fellow server was like wtf is his problem? 

a few minutes later, he called the restaurant. i picked up. 

crazy, extremely angry: ""i was just there and got the worst service of my life. i gave a $28 tip and they never brought the food to my car, it was cold, (etc). you guys have no idea what you are doing.""

me, customer service mode off: ""i am the one who helped you. first off, it was an $8 tip, so that's a lie. second of all, we don't bring orders out to cars, and you never asked me to do so. i'm sorry you had a bad experience, but the way you are speaking to me is rude and uncalled for, and i'm hanging up now.""

i was stoked on being able to stand up for myself knowing i had done my job and nothing less, and did nothing wrong. i shared my victory with the other servers who congratulated me for standing up to someone (which i never never do, in real life or at work lol). 

an hour later he calls back and i recognize the number, so i don't pick up. i did have a weird gut feeling that he called back to apologize, though, i just thought ""nah, no way.""

the next day i'm working the same shift. he came in and stood halfway between me and the door. there was remorse on his face. he asked if i was there the night before. i said yes, i was the one he spoke to.

crazy: ""i am so sorry for the way i behaved last night my behavior was inexcusable.""

he's looking down and seriously looks like he is about to cry or something. i said i appreciated that he came to apologize, and that i forgave him. he just kinda left still looking really ashamed. 

it gave me some faith in humanity that people can have bad days without being terrible people. if he never came back to apologize, i would have just assumed he was a total piece of shit. i say this a lot but i don't come across all that many people that are irredeemably assholes. most people can own up to their shit and view us as humans, when they see what their bad behavior can do to others. at least in the area i live.


tl;dr: crazy old dude comes into my restaurant, lies about giving me a $28 tip when it was $8, calls to tell me off again, gets owned by me then apologizes.

914,"an ""attempted murder""","hey since you guys really enjoyed my first story working at a casino restaurant, have 3 stories involving murder because those are apparently work stories i unfortunately have and wish i was making up. here's the first.

an ""attempted murder""

so this takes time during an ordinary slow day. these two ladies walk into the restaurant and have a seat. while looking at the menu, they call over the nearest staff member to ask questions and that person happened to be our manager. so they play 20 questions with him and eventually lets them go. the server comes along and takes their order. food comes out for lady b. 15 minutes pass and lady b is like halfway done with her food while lady a is sitting there not doing shit and i am assuming was still waiting for her order to come out. lady a flags the server and interrogates her for the location of her meal that she actually never ordered. so lady a is claiming she ordered with the manager, who says that lady a was only asking about ingredients (she has a peanut allergy). 
our manager comes over to explain the misunderstanding but this bitch was not gonna have some man telling her she was wrong oh no. this bitch was gonna argue saying she did fucking order with big tie wearing suit man. after like 20 minutes, my manager gives up trying to use logic and compromise/compensation (offering a discount and rushing the ticket) and decides ""fuck it, i got a mountain of paperwork to do in the office and i am already behind."" and while this shitfest goes on, lady b is just sitting there like a background character hoping they get to live until the end of the movie. so manager offers a comped and rushed meal if the bitch finally shuts the fuck up. you know what this lady's response was? ""no, you're gonna poison me."" this fucking bitch argued with the manager, won through attrition, and then fucking denied her reward in favor of perpetuating this shit show. what. she tells my manager that because she got into an argument with him, that in retaliation, he is going to plant peanuts in her food to trigger her food allergy and apparently murder her. they start battling it out like they're in a courtroom drama and eventually lady a runs out of the restaurant to grab the head of security and drags him back to the table screaming bloody murder. again, lady b is just trying to stay alive in the background and understandably not getting involved in this escalating bootleg crime drama. the crime was attempted murder, the weapon was a peanut, and the witness was lady b nervously drinking from her martini mentally screaming ""why."" at some point when lady a was telling her near death experience to security, it took a turn towards also being a hate crime apparently. as she said this, lady b's eyes screamed, ""oh no."" we're an hour into this crime drama already and the ""surviving victim of a heinous hate crime"" is actually demanding to have the casino call the god damn police. then what i can only describe as god holding up one finger and blurting, ""bitch, hold the fuck right there,"" some random guy who was listening at some point walks over to one of our servers and orders carry out of what lady a originally wanted without peanuts. he comes over to the dramatic bitch and hands it to her saying, ""there, that easy,"" and flies back to neverland. this bitch didn't even questioned it. she finally shut the fuck up and walked out like the last hour was nothing. yea, it could have been that fucking easy if there wasn't an ""attempted murder"" going on. but the biggest miracle today, lady b made it to the end of the movie alive.",PrincessPotoo,tfys
915,need advice for a unique problem,"so this one is going to be a little odd. i need to start off by saying that i am a male. i do not grow facial hair really well. i'm a soft-spoken individual. i don't have a deep voice, but it's not flamboyant either. on the surface everything about me screams androgynous. this includes my name. think robin, sidney, payton... i'm not trans. i'm not gender-queer. i'm fairly certain most strangers confuse me for being a lesbian. none of this has ever bothered me as an adult.

however, this has led to situations at work where i've been mistaken for being female. my coworkers think it's baffling, yet hysterical. i'm in the same boat honestly. i've been serving and bartending for 3 years. my approach has always been the same. i don't correct people. i'm uncomfortable with awkward confrontations. the fuck do i care if my tables think i'm a guy or a girl? i'm not interested in crawling into bed with them. i'm just there to give them friendly service, they pay their bill, and hopefully at the end of it all they leave me money too.

99% of my encounters have nothing to do with my gender. i've had a few experiences where a creepy old man has made the creepy old man comments at me. i gray rock them. i'm there to wait on them. i'm not a stripper. i'm not a prostitute. i don't acknowledge the behavior. i don't encourage the behavior. and my heart sincerely goes out to females that put up with this on a regular basis.

this has never caused anything serious until recently. two incidents specifically.

first, bartending at a restaurant, i'm the only bartender on staff during a bartending shift. i had yet another creepy old man come in. he was calling me sweetie, and sweetheart. i did my thing. i paid no attention. no encouragement. no correction. he tipped normal. nothing outrageous. he seems a bit off. another female bartender actually told me that he had been in the previous day going on about how he was going to beat the living shit out of his female roommate with a baseball bat. a real winner.

well at some point, someone corrected him. he stopped tipping. whatever. however, he's been getting progressively shittier and aggressive towards me, but hasn't crossed a line yet. i don't care about the tip. i just wish he'd go away and leave me the hell alone. i don't need my safety or my job put at risk.

so this had me rethinking how i approach situations like this. and sure enough, today i have three obnoxious younger guys come in, and they are back and forth between calling me a guy and calling me a girl. i correct them. they proceed to ignore me and call me female anyways. actually, i think they settled on me being a trans man. it was awkward, horrible, and above all humiliating. i have nothing against the lgbt community. i have something against being harassed.

what do i do? i just want to bring their food and drinks to the table. i want people to eat, drink, have a good time, enjoy my service, pay, and go. saying nothing comes with risk, and so does saying something. i can't fucking win. i don't want to be harassed at work. i don't want to be jumped in the parking lot. but i don't feel comfortable or even safe anymore.",Olffrick,tfys

just had this lovely interaction with a guest. i work at a driving range of sorts and we have hourly rates depending on when you start your game time. these rates go up at noon, and go up again later at night, when we’re more popular. 


i hate working at rate change because guests always think their rate is based on when they walked in the door rather than when they’re seated at their hitting bay, *starting their time*. it blows their mind every time that they can’t walk in at 11:55, have some drinks at the bar, and go to a bay and get started at 12:15 at the pre-noon rate. 


lo and behold, a bay gets seated at 12:02 on the dot, and i get notified so i can sign them in. i make my way over to check them in, beating them to the bay and wasting no time as i explain rules and have them sign in. cool guest excuses himself to the bathroom but explain he wants me to go over the rules before they start, problem guest (pg) starts trying to sign in and gets frustrated when our system doesn’t recognise his number. i ask him to type his email instead and it works, we progress normally until i ask him how long he’d like to play. he looks at the screen where it shows the rate per hour and frowns. 



pg, using the disgruntled voice: i remember it being cheaper. 


me: yes, well the rate does go up $10 at noon. 


pg: *stares, then reaches for his phone*


me, looking on the clock on screen: it’s currently 12:04, you just missed the morning rates, sorry about that. 


pg: but we walked in before noon. 


me: unfortunately rates are based on when we start your time, not when you enter the building. 


pg: so you’re gonna make me pay $35?


me: *shrugs awkwardly as confrontation makes me uncomfortable* i’m sorry sir, that’s how the system works. we can’t manually change the rate. 


pg: *grunts*


we wait for maybe 15 seconds for his friend to get back before he reaches past me and clicks start time on the console. 


pg: whatever, just fuck off, i don’t need any more help


me: *shuffles outta there*


i felt bad because i wanted to explain the rules for cool guest but i wasn’t about to deal with pg any longer. i did find their waitress and explained what happened so she knew what she was walking into when pg inevitably complained about the bill. 


the funny thing is it’s actually not very hard to comp people $10 on gameplay and i find ways to help groups that are nice to me. some managers can be convinced to comp them the money, sometimes a $10 off coupon mysteriously finds its way to the group in question, but i’m not about to help you out if you treat me or my associates like that.

919,woman took 20 minutes to order and the gm let 3 customers walk out because he doesn’t know how to do his job.,"i was working boh today, but watch this happen through the expo window. a woman in the lobby on her phone the whole time, asking a lot of questions. finally she starts to order and i notice she’s taking a really long time. like long enough for *three* customers to walk out. 

she was on her phone trying to figure out what the person she was talking to wanted. according to my manager this person on the phone couldn’t make up her mind. so she ordered three pancake meals with soft scrambled eggs made with spinach and peppers. but one with green onions. plus a regular scrambled egg plate and 5 orders of potatoes. big order, no big deal it was almost all the same across the board so i could make it all at once. 


the stupid part was my manager let this happen. he is the gm and he is the one who was taking the orders. he said “she wouldn’t let him save her order and help people behind her”. why he wouldn’t just assert himself as the manger and instruct her to move aside and get her ordered figured out while she was on the phone is beyond me. he doesn’t like confrontation to the point he was willing to let three customers leave just to serve one rude lady. i know she had a big order so we still made a decent sale, but she apparently does this every time which, to me, makes it more frustrating. she has been shown this behavior is okay and acceptable at our establishment. 

i know it was 20 min because she wanted all those potatoes and i had to bake more. she was willing to wait, and my estimated time was 20 min. by the time her order went through the potatoes were done. and they go in frozen so it’s not like the cook fast.

 now, i never ask for the children's pricing because i understand that the littles meals are significantly less. i specifically ask if i can get a kids size hamburger and have it rung up as an adult hamburger. i'm also typically ordering one or two adult beverages with dinner so that helps to pad the tab.

 i just don't want to take the other half of a full sized hamburger home with me or leave it at the restaurant uneaten and waste the food.

922,woman tries to kill her son for a free meal,"so to start this is my first post so i apologize if anything is off format,  i only discovered these exist thanks to the overflow of reddit videos on youtube.

&amp;#x200b;

a little back story, when i was 22 i had bounced around several jobs not really knowing where i wanted to end up, and after being unemployed for about month i finally found a decent job as a server at a brand new olive garden that had been built in my neighborhood. it was great, after a week of onsite training in the empty restaurant we had our grand opening. the local community, as well as all the staff, were super excited (it can be incredibly fun to open a restaurant that everyone has been eagerly waiting for).

&amp;#x200b;

fast forward 6 months, everything has been going great, we are constantly busy as the nearest olive garden before ours opened was a good 30 minutes away and didn't have a great reputation. i have received a few raises in that time, some of my friends/coworkers have gotten promoted to trainers and everything, overall, just seems to be going great.  until this family comes in.

it was a saturday evening and i was on the closing shift. if you're a server you already know saturday evening is busy af, and we were no exception. there had been a 45 minute wait (minimum) all day and i had been working 6 tables since the start of my shift.

halfway into my shift i get an 8 top in my section, which is fine by me as it means a.) more tips for me and b.) two of my six tables would be pushed together (less work on an already crazy busy night). i see my table being sat by the hostess as i'm getting refills for another table, she hands out menus and then walks back to the drink area to let me know she had sat my 8 top that she had previously warned me was coming.  the family consists of an older couple (mid 50's-ish) their 3 adult sons (the youngest being in his mid 20's) and the two older sons so/gfs. there is a worrisome look on her face as she lets me know ""they are going to be a handful"" (i found out later that they had been incredibly loud/rude because they had been expected to wait, and had decided to take out much of their frustrations on the poor teenage girl hosting).

&amp;#x200b;

no worries, this isn't the first hangry customers i've served.

&amp;#x200b;

i deliver the refills and immediately head to the table. i make my usual greetings offer a wine sample (no takers), and ask if i can bring them some drinks. the mother looks at me with flaming daggers spewing from her eyes, ""that would be great, since that idiot up front left us waited for almost an hour"" she says. i apologize for their long wait and take all of their drink orders and promise i will get everything on the fly. i rush to the back grab every one of their drinks (even convince the bartenders to bump their drink to the front of the line, i usually tip them out pretty well so they aren't above doing me a favor every now and then), and i'm back within 2 minutes with 7 sodas, 8 waters, and two margaritas.

&amp;#x200b;

the mom is now impressed and the air around the table has begun to get a little lighter, or so i though. after delivering everyone their drinks i begin asking if everyone is ready to order, most are but the mom and the youngest son (who is sitting next to her) have some questions about the food. no worries i know this menu like the back of my hand at this point. i'm casually talking with them both trying to get a feel for what type of dish they are looking for which basically amounts to ""we want lots of pasta and lots... i mean lots of cheese, and none of that weird alfredo with spinach in it"".

&amp;#x200b;

i completely understand, i hate the soggy spinach at the bottom of the alfredo, it's just gross.

&amp;#x200b;

after hearing them out i recommend the 5 cheese baked ziti, as anyone who has eaten it can tell you it is definitely the most pasta filled/cheese filled dish on the menu, and honestly my personal favorite. ""yes"" the mom proclaims ""that is definitely what we are looking for, you are such an attentive waiter"". i'm blushing at this point, i thank her for the compliment and let them know their food will be out quickly.  i don't handle open praise well, not that its not welcome i just get super embarrassed and am never really sure how to respond.

i bring out their salads, get refills, and my nightmare table is happy... like happiness if bubbling from this table. in my mind i'm like, ""boom, i'm a rockstar, i turned the entire mood of this table around just by being my usual helpful self, who's awesome? this guy, that's who"" until the entrees arrive.

&amp;#x200b;

i bring out everyone's food (at this point i have another server helping me as it's a ton of food), everyone is still beaming but i notice the younger son has this sh\*teating grin on his face. i'm like ""ok that's weird"" but the tables still doing good so i don't really put much into it, i ask if everyone is good (they are) and i head to the kitchen to pick up an order for one of my other tables. i'm back there for about 3 minutes when i hear a commotion coming from the dining area. i rush out to find the youngest son gagging and clutching his throat as big pink hives start to appear on his neck.

&amp;#x200b;

h\*ly sh\*t

&amp;#x200b;

the mom is behind his patting him on the back trying to get him to hack up whatever it is that he ate, while the rest of the table looks horrified. i rush to the table pull out my phone and begin calling 911.

before i can hit send the mother stops (her son magically stops coughing) turns to me and vomiting hellfire says ""what do you think you are doing?!?!?"". i tell her i'm calling an ambulance as her son is clearly not ok. she's pissed. ""you think i can afford an ambulance just because you're incompetent?"" she screams, ""go get your manager this instant"". i run to the managers office, at this point i have no idea wtf is going on but i'm not going to start questioning things now (i'm 22 and not the brightest in this regard). the store manager and assistant manager are both in the office going over schedules for the next week, i explain there is an emergency but the woman doesn't want to call 911 and instead is demanding to speak to the manager. they ask me to stay there and rush to the dining room.

&amp;#x200b;

i waited in that office for what seemed like hours, having a panic attack because i literally could not figure out what had just happened. was he allergic to something and just not know about it? what could it be? the oregano? idk. the store manager comes back in and she is f\*cking livid.

""why would you recommend the ziti to somebody with a sever allergy to pasta and cheese?!?!?!?!?"" she screams at me. ""wait... what?"" i say, my mind still trying to wrap my head around the bullshit hurricane that i'm now facing. ""the ziti, they said they told you their son had a sever allergy to pasta and cheese and asked you for a recommendation to accommodate him, and you suggest f\*cking ziti????""

at this point i'm like ""whoa b\*tch calm the f\*ck down"". i take a deep, deep breath and begin to explain what happened.

""they never said any of that, in fact they asked specifically for which dish had the most cheese and pasta"" (bingo it clicks they want free food) ""i'm pretty sure they are just doing this for a free meal, why would a person who is deathly allergic to pasta and cheese come to an oliver garden?"" i say, attempting to reason with my manager who is now red faced (i swear you could almost see the steam escaping her nostrils)

&amp;#x200b;

""i don't care"" she screams, ""even if they didn't say it you should've known better""

""how would i have known, i'm not a mind reader"" i yell back (bad idea)

she takes a deep breath ""you are going to be paying for their meal from your tips, and after your shift you will be let go with a formal reprimand"". oh hell no. this table had rung up a bill well over $200 and i currently made $3 an hour plus tips (this was the early 2000's, when it was still legal to pay servers well under the federal minimum wage because ""they make it up it tips"") i look her dead in the eyes and muster every ounce of courage i possibly could (plus i was mostly running on adrenaline and anger at this point so, yeah that probably helped) i say ""go f\*ck yourself"" and leave her office.

i grab a handful of ande's mints from the bucket we kept them in (they're good, sue me) and walk out. on my way out i see the family laughing their asses off, the son's hives have completely disappeared and they are all reveling in the fact that their stupid f\*cking plan worked. they see me and shoot me the most smug smiles i have ever seen. i smile, wave, and flip them off on my way out the door. i have no idea what happened after that and honestly i don't care. in one night i went from have the best most supportive job i'd ever had to having my entire world turned upside down. the pay was sh\*t but i genuinely enjoyed my work and it sucked to have a boss who had been so cool before completely turn her back on me in favor of these con artists.

924,i tried to burn the place down accidentally..,"tl;dr: whoops. i almost burned the place down accidentally says enough. also, please know english isn't my first language. so grammatical errors will occur.

&amp;#x200b;

this was a few years ago. i recently started working in a bar in a small town with around 10000 people. there were a few bars around, and the bar i started working at was one of them. small, and the only people who would come in were regulars that came for a drink after work. usually around 12pm the place would have died out and we would close. however, you were not allowed to close the bar until you had less than 5 people at the bar after 12pm.

it was custom for these small bars to be ran by one person alone. this meant you were manning the bar, kitchen &amp; would do all the clean up by yourself. this normally was no issue as there was always regular keeping an eye on the bar and there would be maximum 10 people. i think i worked around 3 shifts when i was given the key to the place, the code to the safe &amp; instructions on how to lock everything down.

the day shit broke down probably was my 5th shift at the bar, and i knew i had to lock down and close up all by myself. it was around 11pm, and i wasn't expecting any more customers so i slowly started to clean up. but then it came.. the people in town heard there was a new barmaid, and even more interesting, one that wasn't born in the city where the bar was.

as soon as the clock rang 12pm the bar was crowded. everything that i had been told seemed to be a lie. i had around 60 people in the bar, and i was alone. alone, my first time as a bartender and running my ass off as if there was no tomorrow. around 8 am i finally got the last customer out and i was able to start cleaning. by this time, i had worked a 14 hour shift and i was feeling exhausted. i cleaned the bar, balanced the register, put the money in the safe and had a revenue around 10 times the normal. by the time i was done cleaning the worst mess, it was around 10am. i cleaned all the glasses, the bar, knew my register was ok and had just worked a 16 hour shift. so i decided it was enough. i couldn't stand on my legs anymore, and seeing i had to work again 10 hours later i hoped my manager would understand the place was not spotless.

&amp;#x200b;

and so i went home. 9 hours later, i made my way back to the bar. greeted my colleague that was there and my boss who immediately pulled me aside. she told me she was not angry at me, as she could see by the revenue that i had a crazy busy night, but to try and leave the place spotless that evening. i agreed that the place wasn't looking perfect in the morning for my colleague and promised her i would leave it spotless for the next day.

oooh boy, was that a mistake. after my short talk with my boss, i manned the bar, and started the shift. apparently after people had so much fun the night before, and told everyone how hard i had worked that night people got curious about this new barmaid. so around 10pm people started pouring in. they became more and more, until there was literally no spot left in the bar for people to stand. i tried calling my boss, to explain her i needed help but there was no answer as she had a little bit too much to drink before she went home after i started manning the bar.

i ran, and ran, and did everything i could for the customers. we joked, we had fun and i worked hard. at some point i felt like i was dancing behind the bar. i was making twist and circles, brought out perfect beers and everyone told me how satisfied they were about this complete stranger, and that i was a cool chick and handling things well.

eventually, finally things settled down. at this point it was 9am. a 15 hour shift, after the 16 hour shift i ran the day before. i heard the words from my boss from the day before ringing in my ear ""leave the bar spotless"" so i decided that was what i was going to do. i cleaned like a madman, and i managed to up my revenue from 10 times the normal to around 15 times. i felt proud. eventually it was almost 12am. i looked around the bar and it was looking spotless. everything was shining as if it came out of a magazine.

but there came my fatal error. 19 year old me decided to go the extra mile and also clean up the smoking area. by this point i was apparently so numbed by the lack of sleep and exhaustion that i didn't notice there was still some hot ash in the ashtrays (i am a smoker, so it was mine..) and went down to the bar and emptied the ashtray to finally go up to the door and close the bar.

that afternoon i got a call around 2pm. it was my boss... i immediately knew something was wrong, and was expecting i fucked up something with the register or something. i wanted to ignore it, but i needed this job. so i picked up. i remember it so vividly. the first thing she asked me is if i had a nice sleep. i told her yeah.. but a bit short.. but then asked her to tell me what's going on.

and there she goes.. she explained to me i put the bar on fire with that last ashtray.. they send out 3 firetrucks to stop the fire. luckily i left the bar so late, the neighbour noticed the smoke coming from the bar, and there was no big damage besides the door being kicked in, some scorch marks on the bar and a melted trashbin. when i heard it i just wanted to sink into the ground. i was confused (maybe due to the lack of sleep) and said; what?! i did no such thing! after which she explained me again what had happened with the ashtray.

before she could say anything else, i told her i was coming. threw on some clothes and ran to the bar as fast as i could. i helped with the aftermath of the ashes everywhere and then it hit me.. i started another shift as people came running in from all over the city to see what had happened and i had to stand there behind the bar with maybe 2 hours of sleep until (luckily only) 3pm explaining that i was the one putting the bar on fire.

all bad luck, lack of sleep and stupid actions aside. it got me immediately accepted into the small village as everyone knew about ""the girl that tried to burn the bar down"". and till this day everyone there calls me little pyromaniac everytime i come to visit. i didn't get fired either and worked there for 3 more years. i have many more stories about this bar, but my introduction as ""little pyromaniac"" will probably always be the best one.

i might write up some other stories from this bar later on if you guys are interested.

i love my job, but i hate having people sent into the pits for heavy contact and arguing that they're having to spend their time listening to me. at the end of the day, we're here to keep you safe. though we understand you're here to have fun, we've seen some nasty shit, and you need to take this seriously. 

i've had people scream at me, swear at me and attack members of staff. some people don't realise that they can and will be held accountable for their actions (in court, or blacklisting). 

if you guys ever go karting, please remember, the staff are there to keep you safe. it's a high pressure work environment and we also often accommodate those with disabilities. safety is our main concern. so be kind to your marshals, you may not agree with them, but honestly, they just don't want anyone to die.

927,food delivery app hell,"we’ve recently gotten more and more food delivery app orders who do not tip the servers putting together the to-go. i get $2.13 an hour plus tips. spending half my night doing these orders is killing my wallet. i spent some time on the postmates/doordash subreddits and looked through folks’ feelings regarding tipping the restaurant on a to-go. the general feeling was “fuck them, i never tip on a to-go, they don’t deserve it. the front of the house is literally just taking a bag of food from the back to the front” and “i don’t get why they’re so pissy when we show up.” yea, i do get pissy when i don’t get tipped from a to-go. it’s pulling me away from my tables. i’m the one making the specialty coffees, desserts, and soups. i’m checking everything in the order and labeling it all. i’m grabbing the extra shit your customer asked for, putting it in containers and bagging it. in other restaurants i’ve worked, the servers were even making the damn salads. we do a lot and i want to be paid for it. these services not giving an option to tip the restaurant is bs. i know of some other places being anti food delivery apps altogether, not even fulfilling the orders. some add an automatic gratuity. how are you guys dealing with these services? sorry for the rant but i see this as the future of restaurants and wonder how servers will survive.",sharethispoison1,tfys
928,more chicken!!?,"so, i work takeout for a popular restaurant. i take orders, pack them up and hand them out. no problem. except when it’s 20 mins after closing time.

at 10:40, i get a call from a woman and she asked for a simple order. she specifically asks her bread to be separated (keep this in mind). as i’m getting the order ready, she calls back and asks for something else. my manager takes the call because i was in the back getting her original order ready. cool. so i gather her food and i wait. we close at 11 and it’s 11:05. so i’m waiting because i can’t close my register if i have any open tickets.

she finally arrives at 11:20 and she goes “oh, when do you close” and i say “oh.. 11pm” no apology or anything was given lol i’m going over everything with her and she makes a face. when i asked the problem, she goes on about her chicken alfredo and garlic bread touching. i explain that whoever took her additional order (my manager) didn’t know you wanted them separate and i apologized.

as i’m about to cash her out when suddenly she goes..”i’m sorry, i forgot to ask for another salad.” i freeze. and i say, let me see if there’s any salads left in the fridge so that i can get someone to make you one. it was a house salad so my manager made it because it was easy to make. i give her the salad (with extra balsamic like she asked).

as i’m about to ring her out she goes... “wait, i want more chicken. there’s not enough.” i look at her and say “ma’am, we closed at 11. the cooks went home. i apologize for the inconvenience but there are literally no chefs here.” she gives me a glare and pays for her food and leaves a fat ass 0 on the tip line despite us accommodating her even after we closed. i hate people.",unicornpissandmagic,tfys
929,needy people,"i hope you all had a great one today, or will have a great day today! 

sorry for punctuation or any errors in advance! 

so today was a rather slow day according to our ipad that displayed open table for reservations, 27 covers (head count) consisting of a 9, 8, 4, 4, and 2 (part sizes that add up to 27). 
turns out we had a lot of walk-ins. yes, it should have been a given that since it was a friday many people were going to come in. but we initially thought it’d be a slow day due to weather (raining a lot). and yes, our restaurant fluctuates heavily depending on the weather. 

well anyways, since we had a full staff on the floor (4 servers including myself) i was the opener willing to take any walk-ins and letting the closers take the resos + additional walk-ins that i couldn’t take. 

i had this one table, a 2 top, that was super needy. now, let me tell you some background info about this table as well as my other tables i had (5 tables not including this 2 top). put to simple, i was in the weeds. i had 2 tables that finished oysters and i needed to clear&amp;crumb their table and set up for appetizers. i had another table that i also needed to clear to set up for entres, and another to reset for desserts. the other table was my ‘oh shit, i just got double sat” table. so the problem comes because someone stole my 2 desserts i fired for a table that wanted. both. desserts. not a huge issue, but the issue was that some other server stole my desserts. 

so anywho, i had that going on and we sort of had a vip table (regulars and friend of our owners) and obviously the chiefs were prioritizing their meals and placing everyone else’s as ‘not a priority’ situation. 

so i’m getting this needy tables orders which thankfully they ordered everything all at once. they requested water with lemons, for their oysters they wanted the whole deal (cocktail, horseradish, and tobacco.. which we don’t give customers unless they ask). i didn’t have a problem getting any of this, but they just kept asking for more after i had already asked, “could i get you guys anything else”. 

i racked their bill to be $157 (i do my best to get all 2 tops at $150 to be profitable for me). they only tipped $10. beyond frustrated after getting them everything they needed and more. 

so yeah, that was my day- my rant for tonight. it’s annoying when your busting ass for a table and going beyond their expectations and they don’t tip well. still, they tipped and that’s all that matters, but at the end of the day. . if you can’t tip the norm 18-20% then you shouldn’t be dining at that restaurant. 


also, i understand that tip is something that we work for. i understand that certain places don’t require tip and so forth. but still, it sucks.

you tipped me 2.60 on a 47 dollar bill and your other party tipped me 4.40 on a 60$ bill....you had full drinks all night, you had your food come out correctly. you had great service. you had 3 beers and a bloodmary, which i have to tip the bartender for..... i even gave you free drinks, free “soda”. 
you saw how tired i am, you see how malnourished and hungry i am; you can tell i’m a struggling, depressed college student. i can’t hide those things and you must understand....
you stared me in the eyes as you walked by me and i saw so much pain, i saw how unhappy you are because you had the same look i see in my own eyes.
you have money, i can tell you are well off, you were wearing a watch that must have cost a few hundred and you are from a town and school that takes pride in how much wealth is accumulated here, and yet you went out tonight with your family to make another person as miserable as you are..... and for that i feel bad for you.
i’m not saying i deserve more of a tip because of how much i’m struggling, but finding ways to validate your actions and not have any courage to even talk to me like another person does make me angry...i won’t lie. but, more than anything, it makes me sad. you are as miserable as i am, and for that you have my sympathy....

i work at a corporate restaurant and have worked there since about july. i started off as a server and have moved into doing cocktail and to-go serving. all the managers have told me i am great and i have never received anything bad from anyone about my workmanship. i am always at work and give them literally my life as my schedule is pretty much an open book before i return to school. so with the to-go position is supposed to be a pay raise from 2.13 to 3-4 even 5 dollars. i was promised this upon accepting the offer and every other to-go server makes that amount but now corporate, even the owner of the entire company told my managers i don't deserve it and he doesn't believe i should be getting paid that much to do my job -\_\_- do i have a right to be annoyed?",Ecolixed,tfys

933,i turtle shelled into my shirt in front of a customer when he said i didn't have big enough tits.,"background- i am a male server with a beard (important later) in a truckstop in the middle of mo. truckers are predominantly men. truckers dont really socialize for 3/4 of their day. most truckers in my missouri truckstop are loud, obnoxious, sexist, racist braggarts.

&amp;#x200b;

as a male server in this world, i have to rely on my charm and abrasive sense of humor. when truckers are used to oogling the girlys and talking down to them because they think they can bully the waitresses; i can't bat my eyelashes and expect a 10% tip from them. but when i serve over 50 people in 8 hours with average tips between 2-5 bucks, i suck it up.

&amp;#x200b;

since i am no nonsense and back everything i say up with what i do, i also get away with a lot more than i normally should. in a normal restaurant, hell no. in an establishment when a guest can go to the bathroom for 10 minutes and return to tell on of the female waitress ""you are just so sexy i had to go to the bathroom and rub one off."", i am allowed to clapback when i can.  


last sat i was running a 50 seat section by myself, 9 booths, 3 tables, and 25+ single seats at the bar. i hustle and bustle to keep everything clear and moving and wont stop to entertain your wild conversations because you think your the next eddie murphy raw. one guy wouldnt let it up though. every chance he got when i came by, he would say something to try to be edgy and funny; which i brush off by asking if that was a result of his food or not. at the end of his meal, trucker and me went through this bit of dialogue-  


**me**\- so is there anything else i can do for you today?

&amp;#x200b;

**trucker**\- i just have one complaint about the service. my waitress didn't have big enough tits and to much hair on her face.

&amp;#x200b;

at this point i had had enough. i don't condone sexist comments if i can help it, and i will go out of my way to make you as mad or uncomfortable as i can if you are a bother to me or my coworkers; tip be damned. only enough seconds go by for me to see the smug look on his face before i start.

934,thoughts on the show sweetbitter?,"i just watched it and as a new york city server i was intrigued but it also annoyed me lol.

intrigued because there was some pretty spot on representation to how things are, annoyed because the characters and that type of restaurant are literally everything i hate about that type of restaurant lmaooo. 

honestly i trained at a place like that not that long ago (except the food quality was so terrible it didnt need to be like that at all), and i shit you not it was spot on to the way ppl dressed and acted that worked there, and also that doe eyed transplant bullshit of the main character was grating af...

so i guess in all honesty it annoyed me because of its accuracy for overly pretentious and romanticized nyc fine dining lol. 

the way everyone hangs out and fucks each other and is super casual and in your face with each other and about their own personalities in the industry was pretty on it though as well as the ruthlessness.

wondering any other ppls thoughts on this?  also post what city/state you work in cause i'm curious regionally how opinions on it might differ ??

i would love a show that was similar but less like romanticized, and about like, a more lowkey place with less pretentious ppl working there..and maybe not with a transplant lol.

also, what do you think a server at a place like that makes annually? let's say pt/20 hours a week, or full time?

(also if anyone wants a bonus on my quit email after training at that place that was just like this let me know lmao it was pretty savage. i was annoyed cause they were not transparent on my interview about the training and shit at all, and told me repeatedly it wasnt fine dining and that it was a cool low key place, when it in fact, was not)

he did have this wide eyed look on his face and seemed stressed like maybe the gm botched him out about something unrelated and the restaurant wasn't even open yet.

friday night i was the closing server. i came in and was informed i would be taking a 30 top at the back of the restaurant. cool. i'm really good at big tops, and that took up my entire section so i wasn't going to have to deal with other tables at the same time. i'm good with this.

first of all, the table was really needy. which again, was fine because they were my only table, but basically every time i grabbed them something by the time i came back they wanted something else. they were also incredibly slow. their reservation was for 6  and by 730 they had only ordered drinks and apps because they were waiting on some people still. my manager then tells me he wants to cut a few servers and move me to the front of the restaurant, which is normal at around 730-8. i tell him okay, but only if he's okay with supporting me because my 30 top hasn't ordered yet. he agrees to this.

start serving my new section. i told the host to try and minimize seating me as best she can because i still have that 30 top and she says she'll try, but that section is entirely booths so people request it all the time. i get triple sat pretty fast. get their orders, put them in, and tell my manager that i'm heading to the 30 top because the last couple of people finally showed up so i'm going to get their order and will probably be back there for 10-15 minutes (which turned out to be a pretty accurate guess). he told me he would watch my section, but i think all he did was run my food when it came up because i have two new tables that haven't been greeted and nobody has refills. okay. i greet my new tables, get everyone refills, and check on the food to make sure it is all correct. everyone seems happy. 

i then see my 30 top flagging me down, so i go back there. a few people have changed their mind on what they want to order and half the table needs refills. i do this. when i'm done, i go and check on my front tables. most need refills again, i have another two tables, and two of my first three tables are done eating. i drop off dessert menus, get drinks and refills and now the food for my 30 top is up. so i ask my manager to watch my front tables again while i run that and give him a quick run down of where everyone is at. 

so i run the 30 top's food. half of them can't remember what they ordered because they changed it, everyone needs refills, and a few people want dipping sauces they didn't order when they ordered their food. so i get all this, and it's probably been 15-20 minutes by now since i was at my other tables, but no worries because my manager is watching them, right? wrong. as far as i can tell he didn't do anything. so now most of the first tables i got are pissed because they've been sitting so long, other tables are pissed because they haven't gotten their food yet, and the newish tables are pissed because they haven't been able to order yet. 

i run around, apologize profusely to all of them, get refills, orders, and drop off cheques. i also get another two new tables and get their orders as well. at this point, someone from the 30 top comes to find me because they want refills and haven't seen me in a while. so i again ask my manager to take payments for me and watch my section while i go to the back. at this point i want to ask someone else, but he had cut the rest of the servers so it was just me and him so my options were limited.

i go get their refills and they want their bill's. separate, of course. so before i do this i go find my manager and inform him that i will be separating the cheque and will be longer in the back than i had originally thought and will need him to continue watching my section. i separate the bill's. two couples have coupons which they give me after i drop the bills so i go and apply those. most of them tip pretty average, except for the two people with the highest bills ($70ish and $150ish) who leave me nothing. thanks assholes. anyway, go back to my section, and a few tables are gone and my manager hands me some slips so i guess he took those payments. the tables still sitting are pissed again because he didn't check on them at all so they've been sitting forever. i apologize again and offer them free dessert.

the rest of the night went smoothly, but most of my tables that i had at the same time as the 30 top didn't tip, so i made less than 10% that night. and one of them left the review. i don't entirely blame them because i know the service wasn't great, but i really did do my best and it would have been nice if they had either kept on one more server or he had done a better job of helping.

941,the shirtless guy,"for disclosure, this is from a fast food resturant but this seemed like the most appropriate subreddit for it. 

i was about 3 weeks into working at a popular fast food joint and worked with my twin sister who mentioned some of the stories of customers the year she worked there before i joined, she mentioned one at a point that was just bizarre and i brushed it off. it was about this homeless man who would walk in and demand to see the manager, and he would never have his shirt on.

it was around 9pm, my shift was over in an hour and it was fairly calm. the store is in a part of town that was exceptionally comfortable for the homeless community especially since we are in the northern u.s. we are accomodating to them of course, not just because we are a customer is always right kind of resturant, but the homeless population is large. but let me say, 1/4 of them i fully understood why they were there.

a man that, to me seemed like he was in his 70s from how unclean he was, but considering the lack of gray hair i'd imagine he was younger. he carried a hiking bag on him and a large sleeping bag in his arm. he looked at me with wide eyes as i stood at the counter and walked to the restrooms which were immediately out of site. [sg] a my assistant manager came up to me. [am]

am: hey, i got to do some work in the back, but come get me when that guy comes out. 

i looked at him quizzically, a bit confused but agreed, my mind immediately went to the shirtless guy as i have seen plenty of weird guys come in. i distinctly remember thinking how hilarious it would be if he came out without a shirt. well, it wasnt to my amusement when that happened.

he came up and immediately tried to get behind the counter, he still had his hiking bag on him but his shirt dissappeared along with his sleeping bag. he had no shoes on either but i can't remember if he came in with them.

i blocked his way, although as someone with aspergers and only 3 weeks into my first job was nervous as hell.

me: ""i'm sorry, only staff members are allowed back here.""

sg: ""i need to see your manager!"" he said demandingly, not really shouting but almost alarmingly.

me: stumbling over my words a bit, ""just give me a moment.""

another coworker was up here, she was here for only about 2 or 3 days confused as hell, i asked her to wait for a minute as i went and got the am

me: ""he came out and..."" i try to play off some of the nervousness, ""i think he lost his shirt in the bathroom."" 

am looked at me with a mix of disbelief and the despair that humanity has fallen ever further from gods light. looking back at it, since he recognized the man it was probably just the latter. 

am stomps to the front and i follow behind. i shit you not, the man immediately said as he saw am with his distinct shirt, ""i lost my shirt in the bathroom. "" 

am not wanting to deal with sg's shit walks to completely block entrance to the employee only area  and says, ""you are not allowed in here without a shirt. go and leave or we will call the police, we have told you this multiple times."" and surprisingly sg leaves without issue. am begins to walk back, just annoyed to all hell, i talk to him.

me: ""let me check the restroom real quick, that is where he had went."" am nodded, just frustrated and i went.

in the stall i could find only a single thing, the god damn sleeping bag. the shirt had dissappeared and the shoes might never have existed. we never found out about the shirt, i threw the bag away and was just in disbelief there are people this damn strange.

a few hours later i had a family of four, two very shy girls (who if i had to guess were younger than ten) and their parents. awesome table, super nice and although they tried to have the girls order for themselves, they didn’t push it and ordered for them when it was clear they were uncomfortable ordering for themselves. the youngest one looked at me and said “you’re really pretty” and i melted into a puddle because i’ve never ever heard that from a kid, especially a shy one, and we all know how brutally honest kids are. i’ve worked as a server for almost four years now and today was a day i won’t forget. hearing feedback you hoped to earn but worried to your core that you didn’t, and then hearing something like that from a child who could barely say “mac and cheese” to you before..it’s just a day that i won’t forget. 

i want to hear your stories, tell me about that “day” for you ",ReginaFilange21,tfys
944,tomorrow's breakfast: shit soup.,"i open and close the restaurant every day with no complaints, but today i really need to complain about my waitress. i'm the foh manager, and tonite we had on 3 employees. the chef was feeling ill, and left early. the sous did the job of three people, prep, cooking and dishwashing. the waitress was left to clean up by herself and entertain the last guests.

the last guests were talkative, gave opinions on every dish. european folks, lovely gentleman, who sucked the waitress in to a half hour conversation (they were the only guests left and i encourage as much interaction with the guests as possible) and while she smiled and listened to their input (which was great input by the way, we so rarely have the time to interact with guests like this) and joked, the clock ticked on. 

suddenly, it is 11:10, and the waitress needs to put on her tennis shoes and book it to the last bus to take her home. gentleman number 1 leaves. gentleman number 2 leaves a number 2 in our only bathroom, clogs the toilet, and waitress slowly realizes that, because she is also the foh manager, i can either choose to miss my bus and sleep in the restaurant or i can leave it to become my morning problem. i frantically try to fix the toilet while changing into my tennis shoes to run to the bus...

and this is how i realized i desperately need to hire a waitress.

946,give me money. i'm wearing a bomb.,"there are some things you just cannot make up. while working a night shift at a corporate steakhouse, this wonderous event happened. we had a small take-away nook where the to-go people worked. it had its own door and everything. i was standing nearby watching the dining room when a small woman came in the door and whispered too the take-away server ""help me, he strapped a bomb to me. if i don't rob you, he will blow us all up."" i, of course, am invested in this ridiculous drama now. the take-away guy is only 18 at most, but he doesn't freak out or anything. he just studies her for a moment, and we all see she has a random wire draped around her neck but not much else. he excuses himself to get the manager.

now, this manager was a great, funny guy. he comes up, sees her and just points at the door. ""go away.""

947,conflict theory in highly corporate restaurants [discussion],"i recently got to thinking, the more i work in restaurants with a very corporate structure, how conflict theory plays into the management/server dynamic. this is a long post, but it was something i felt like typing up because i think it's interesting to discuss and be conscious of. feel free to call me out if you disagree

&amp;#x200b;

conflict theory has a lot of different applications, but the way i'm applying it here is: there is an innate conflict of interest between the corporation management and the employees serving tables in a tip-based system. in corporate restaurants, the management want what's best for the finances of the company, whereas servers want what it best for their personal finances. oftentimes, these two can't coexist, and by default this conflict is the major factor in a system which basically sets servers up to fail. 

the most glaring example of conflict theory is the clear fact of management overloading employees with more customers than they can reasonably serve, then making them to believe that if they can't manage properly then they aren't fit. in fact, in any late capitalist society this is common in pretty much every workforce. this demonstrates conflict theory because the corporation benefits from getting more revenue with less paid labor, but the server suffers because their tips can be impacted by the poor service they have to give. 

&amp;#x200b;

another example in some cases can be the ""hot food hot"" policy, that is: management encourages servers to run other servers' food whenever possible. some management can become overbearing and shame employees into running other servers' food.  ""i saw you walk through the kitchen and look at all that food and you didn't run any of it."" this benefits the corporation because turning and burning produces more revenue within the store's hours of operation, and ultimately as long as the customer pays for their food, the company wins. however this can negatively impact the servers for 2 reasons.  

\- for one, focusing on another coworker's food can detract from focusing on your tables, plain and simple. of course it's always good to help coworkers, and you should when able to. however (as in my case), management assumes just because they saw you walk by food empty handed that you're available to help others. a server is responsible for their tables only because that is their direct revenue, not anyone else's.

\- it could be argued that a table is likely to tip better if they have more direct contact with one consistent server. i don't have a source for this, but from my experience it seems like common knowledge. that table can wait the extra 30 seconds for their food if it means having their server-- who's been assigned to that table-- deliver the food. it makes a better impression and can benefit tips.

sorry for grammatical and punctuation errors in advance!

&amp;#x200b;

i work at a steak &amp; oyster house that has a couple of korean dishes that we sell  (not super fine dining, but just a level up from casual dining if that makes sense). just little facts, i am korean, and our main demographic of customers we get in make minimum \~60k/yr. 

&amp;#x200b;

this actually happened last summer and i was serving to an older white gentleman with his wife. during the summer our restaurant goes through hundreds of oysters during our happy hour rush. so as this couple sat in my section right after oyster happy hour, we ran through all of our beausoleil oysters which are freaking bomb! so anyways, i was explaining the menu's (meal, oyster, and alcohol) and the gentleman seemed very impatient. he would cut me off from my spiel every time. \*i also informed the couple of what we were 86 of (out of). 

after the spiel, i gave them a couple minutes to look at the menu. when i came back, they had ordered roughly 2 dozen oysters as an appetizer but the thing was they had ordered 2 dozen beausoleil's- which we were out of. the dude was pissed. he did the whole hand motion stuff and asked if i went to high school and college in america, to which i replied, ""yes"". he then asked for a manager, who could actually speak english. funny enough, both of the owners are asian-american including our manager. our manager was running the expo line as our owners like to be on the forefront of the restaurant hosting and greeting everyone.

i told the owner, m, everything about my challenging table. so i went with m to that challenging table and man the look that older gentleman had lol. 

after the conversation, the older gentleman apologized to me and started using 'please &amp; thank you' . i was hustling that table like with any other table and got their bill to be around $520ish (sold them 4 bottles of wine) 

tip? i guess the wife felt bad for me or something, but i remember them tipping me $120 with a little note on the top! on the top it said ""sorry for being rude"" !!

949,guy demands to use our phones then calls our managers cunts,"buckle up guys, this is a long one. btw, sorry for any bad grammar. english is my first language so i really don’t have any excuse, i’m just kinda dumb. i won’t be doing as much direct dialogue as most people do just because i don’t remember who said what, i just remember that they were said at some point. if i do it might not be 100% correct, as i don’t remember who said what, but it won’t really matter as we all end up saying pretty much the same thing. sorry for the length also.

just some background info. so i’m 17 and i work in a restaurant, and have for about a year and a half. not especially pertinent just some background info. it was sunday morning which is our busiest time of the week. people come in for breakfast and brunch, and sometimes there is a waiting list that can reach up to an hour long, and stay like that for hours. i’m one of four hosts, and we each have a different position kinda. one of us is the greeter, one of us the seater, etc. oh also the host stand is right in front of the door (obviously.)

sorry for so much info! it just kinda adds to the understanding of the story. so anyways. one day a couple came in, got put on the waitlist, eventually got seated, etc. they didn’t stay too long, probably about an hour, which is normal. then i see the girl leave, without the guy. i didn’t really think about it much as i figured she was maybe going to get something from her car or maybe she was on a tight schedule and had to go while her boyfriend paid the check. 
about 5 minutes later the guy comes up to the stand, asking if we had seen his girlfriend. i responded that she had left about five minutes ago. he seemed slightly shocked and asked to use a phone to contact her. i’ll put some dialogue in now.

i pointed at our restaurant phones next to the host stand, saying, “yeah no problem, you can use one of these!” our restaurant phones are, of course, not smartphones. the only thing you can really do is dial numbers and receive calls. hell, the call history doesn’t even work.

he frowned, and replied, “no, i can’t use that, i need to use one of your guys’ phones. i don’t have her number, i only have her instagram

we were all confused. this man claims this girl is his girlfriend and he only had her instagram ?? at this point we were all 100% sure that she was not actually his girlfriend, and that this was probably just a really bad first or second date. so bad that she ended up leaving him behind. once you finish reading this story, it won’t be hard to understand why. 

at this point, one of us told him, “we can’t do that, sorry. we are not allowed to have our phones with us and they are in the back, and we are not allowed to go get them or have them out at all.” 

now, to be honest, at least two of us had our phones in the drawers of the stand. but none of us comfortable giving our phone to a stranger with the doors wide open, plus it was a kind of weird request and we didn’t want our managers seeing us with our phones out.

he was not having that, oh no. he started arguing. “no no its ok, it’ll just be for a minute. i just want to log into my instagram and dm her.”

none of us said what we were really thinking, which is that if she was really his girlfriend, then why the hell did he not have her number.

we all exchanged glances. even the scouter noticed what was going on and came back to the host stand, confused. another host replied, “no, i’m sorry sir, but we really can’t. it is against company protocol to have our phones with us and out. we are also extremely busy right now.”

now, i’ll be honest, although i normally hate confrontation, and am a people pleaser, i have a quick temper against customers, although i’m good at hiding it. i hate the whole ‘the customer is always right’ nonsense, because that gets taken advantage of so much. now, don’t get me wrong, i love nice customers, and i will go out of my way to make them smile and to make them happy. but for the straight up rude ones? not gonna lie, i get lots of satisfaction from being firm and putting entitled and rude people in their place. i’m never rude back, i just say what needs to be said. sorry for the rant guys. 

nobody seemed to know what to do or what to say to him, so i decided to give it a try. i told him as firmly as i could while still being polite, “i’m very sorry, we have other customers to attend to. the only phone you are allowed to use is the restaurant phone, we are not allowed to give you our phones.”

surprise surprise, this did not work. “yes you are, i’ll be super quick i promise. please please let me use it. she is my ride home.” 

another host repeated to him, “we really can’t, we’ll get in trouble; it is literally against our company policy.”

this goes on for minutes, as we basically repeated what was said above over and over again. 

eventually one of us goes to get our manager.

my manager is really great- she is super fun and friendly, and normally is able to deescalate a situation, so we had confidence she could convince him to leave. 
she walked over, and in her usual bright and friendly way, greets him, and asks how she can help him. i think we all know how he responded. 

“i need to use one of your phones, please. i have to contact my girlfriend, she just left and she is my ride home.”
with a smile still on her face, she started to tell him, “sure, here are our restaurant phones, you can-“

he interrupted her. he literally interrupted one of the managers. again, i like her a lot so that mildly pissed me off, but the whole thing was kinda funny. 

“no i need to use instagram to dm her!”

her smile faltered, and she glanced at us in slight confusion. “i’m sorry, we cannot help you with that.” her words came out slow and unsure. 

“yes you can,” he insists, “just give me one of your phones so i can log into instagram and dm her.” 

“we are not allowed to do that, i’m sorry. the hosts are not allowed to even keep their phones with them, and the managers are only to use it for work related things. none of us can give you our phone, i’m sorry! i’m going to have to ask you to leave now.” she had the same tone i did- firm, but polite. 

he still didn’t get it. “you don’t understand, my girlfriend is my ride home. i have to get in contact with her. please!!! i’m not going to go until you let me talk to her!

by this point people are obviously staring, and me and the rest of the hosts are looking at the scene and at each other in disbelief at how incredulous and bizarre the whole situation was. 

this also went on for a couple of minutes, with both sides basically repeating themselves back and forth. at this point we were trying to resume seating to try and, you know, keep the damn restaurant going, but we’re continuously distracted by the slightly heated argument. eventually my general manager left the food window (where the cooks put the food when it’s done) to try and help the situation, so because of this guy there were no managers to help man the window at our busiest time of the week. she was there for a few minutes, but i don’t remember what was said exactly so i’ll just skip to the juicy part.

my general manager is also really great, but by this time, i didn’t think he would leave even if the damn corporate manager called and told him to. 

“look sir, i’ve heard both the hosts and m tell you many times that they can’t give you their phones. you have to leave now. we have to continue working with our other customers.”

now obviously he refused, arguing, “no let me use one of your guys’ phones please!! i literally have to talk to her.”

my general manager decided to try a more tactical planning, telling him, “there are public buses that cost $2 that can talk you home i’m sure.” makes sense, right? apparently not. 

“moshe is my ride i have to talk to her and get home. give. me. your. phone!!”

he was getting really angry at this point. 

the general manager, unsurprisingly, looked shocked. “no, none of us are going to give you our property. not only is it against company policy, but even if it were not, we do not have to. it is time for you to leave. now.” 

now, again, my general manager is really great, but obviously as the general manager, has the air of authority. she can downright scary when she’s angry, as with most managers. maybe this is what finally made him give up. 

he glares at her, before turning his angry gaze to each one of us as we stared at him slightly. even the other customers were quiet and also staring. “fine,” he spit out- and w thought that would be it, that this ridiculous and wacky experience was over. however, before he turned and walked out, he said in mock ‘trying to be quiet’ kinda voice, “fuck you stupid cunts!”

we were all in shock and disbelief, and most of the hosts are trying not to laugh. we’ve never had anyone like that again (at least not that i’ve seen) and we still laugh about this story to this day.

i’ve talked to a lot of my friends who also work as bus boys and food runners and they say they take home $30-$80 a night! so idk it’s a small restaurant with the most servers on fridays and saturdays with 5 servers and they don’t pool in the tips.

952,man sends me into a massive panic-attack,"first of, i'm not a native english speaker so i apologize for any errors in my spelling.

so a little backstory, this all happened a few months back when i work at a french themed restaurant. the owners themselves didn't really see me as a co-worker or anything like that, so i was overworked daily, and i was often the only waitress working, the only days i had any help was on fridays and saturdays where one of the older waitresses would help me, but she is quite lazy and mainly stood behind the bar and made me drinks. now on most days the place would be kinda busy, and i would do everything on my own, and i worked every day monday to sunday. and i'm not even a strong person, i'm a 5,4 ft tall, 19 year old and kinda skinny girl. plus they stole all of my tips and paid under minimum wage. so needless to say i was already stressed, but i could not find another job at the time so i just sucked it up.

now on the day this happened it was a friday, and i was kinda busy, but not too much. throughout the evening everything had been chill and everyone had been super nice. so when a table of four walks in slightly drunk the older waitress greats them and takes them to a table to be seated as i was taking orders at another table. now that evening we had had a couple complain about the entrecote steaks (they were very thin and overcooked) so we had tried recommending other cuts of steak to avoid any more complaints as the chef/owner can't take any criticism without blaming something or someone else. 

now as i didn't take the order for the new table i wasn't supposed to walk with it when it was time to serve, but the older waitress had decided to hide behind the bar and clean up, so i had to walk and surprise surprise, they had ordered entrecote steaks for the whole table, so i just knew something would be up with this table, but i smile and serve the food and they seem happy. 

i walked back to the kitchen and prayed that the other waitress would take care of it when bam! the door to the kitchen was kicked open and a 7 ft tall and heavy build large man is standing with a plate looking very angry. i make eye contact and see that its one of the men from the table of four i just served.

chef: excuse me? sir you cant be in here

big man: \*pointing at me\* hey you, come here right now and tell me what the f\*\*\* kind of s\*\*\* this is!!!

now after this is very much a blur, because i went into the biggest panic attack i have ever had, but the man apparently threw food everywhere and cursed everyone out until my boss calmly took him to his table and told them their drinks where all free. now i was in such a bad state at that point that they almost called the hospital, but i pulled myself together enough to ask for permission to go home, which i got but just barely. i stopped working there shortly after this happened and i luckily found a job a couple weeks after leaving, but i will never step foot in that place ever again.",Hailstanallmighty,tfys
953,“you look like you’ve had a hard day”,"i just found this sub- but this happened in december. i work at a pretty nice restaurant, and have had some pretty terrible days. this was a particularly terrible one. the manager had been in an awful mood and was taking it out on me, customers had been very rude because we were slammed and very short staffed, so food was taking longer. it was finals week. all in all, just the worst day. i had probably been yelled at over 15 times at this point and was about to lose it. 

we had a reservation for a 10 top coming in, and i was so stressed about how we could manage it. they walk in, and it was about 3 older couples. i didn’t take their table, but was in the section next to them. it had been an hour, and the other four people never showed up. they were getting up to leave and i went over to say “thanks for coming.” the older lady explained that they had some gifts left over because some of their friends hadn’t shown up (it was christmas time) and she said i should have it because it looked like i’d had a hard day. 

i almost started crying. it was a really pretty bag with some kitchen towels, hot chocolate mix, and a mug. it made my day. i remember that woman every time i feel like i’m drowning at work- and that there are good people who know how hard you’re trying.

954,how crazy was the customer? she nearly sent us to the hospital!!,"i work as a manager in a rather big restaurant in copenhaguen. this night we had a huge party for 200 guests, and all had been going rather smoothly. we were almost done serving desserts.

then i noticed a waiter standing by a table, and i noticed the guest’s big angry eyes and wide open mouth as if yelling over something. and as we do, i got over in my manager jacket and took over the situation. i got in between them and took my standard “how can i help?”-stance with my hands together palms up, and body bend a little forward. she turned her head towards me, with eyes as big as ever, and before i could say a thing, her hand jumped out at me, and i felt two cuts at my palm. i had no clue what was going on! i looked down in complete disbelief as she was holding what appeared to be a piece of glass. and she had just attempted to stab my hand with it. i turned my head to the waiter who was still standing next to me, and she was holding on to her own hands as well and i could see in her eyes that she was about to cry.

the guest had no idea what the isomalt sugar flake was on top of her dessert. she hadn’t taken the time to check out all the other desserts on the table that had the same thing. she immediately thought it was broken glass on her plate, and now she was furious and apparently her brain had switched off completely. i have never experienced such a thing in my life. this is a fancy restaurant, and one of our guests had actually attempted extreme physical assault. she had attempted to cut the hands of two working waiters on the floor. regardless even if it was glass, you don’t bloody engage in attempted and intended physical assault and cut the hands of the nearest random working waiters to you! i have never experienced such a thing in my life! she could have sent us to the hospital!

i made a head gesture to the waiter that she should just run out and get away from the situation. and i knew that i had to talk to this crazy woman as if she was a kindergarten child. so i looked her straight in the eyes and said slowly in a booming voice “it’s sugar”. and i just kept repeating that until she got it. no long words or explanations could calm her down, no, just two simple words she could understand.  and she got it. and she could have eaten herself. turning into the smallest mouse of a person i’ve ever seen. completely unable to say a word. looking around at her fellow guests who were as stunned as i was. and so i left her and went out to compose myself as my waiter had done. we hadn’t been hurt, but we were just so overwhelmed by the idea that someone actually had the intent to do such a thing.

i gave the guest about ten minutes and then i came back to check up how things were. not only was it satisfying enough to see this mouse of a lady unable to look me in the eye. but what happened then was priceless. the guy who had been sitting across from her had been saving his piece of isomalt on the side of his plate. and now that i was there checking up, he grabbed it and waved it in front of himself with the biggest smile, saying loudly “oh everything is just wonderful, and especially this delicious isomalt sugar!” and then he took a huge bite of it and ate it in complete self satisfaction as he looked over to the mouse lade and smiled as big as he could. i could barely contain myself, as the rest of the table was screaming in laughter! i could have made a huge case out of it. but it was clear that she had been completely humiliated by the staff and the rest of the guests. and the mood had been lifted and all the guests were happy. she had had her punishment. and i have my story.",Jillum89,tfys
955,guy in wheelchair tries to kick the police.,"long time lurker. first time poster.

i work at a corporate breakfast restaurant and have since i was 16. we mostly get older guests in, but i'm not sure if its the area or what but i have some of the most ridiculous stories from the 5 years i've been there. this one in particular always stands out to me. 

at the time i was still 16, maaaaybe 17. i don't really remember.  every sunday religiously we had these two regulars come in for lunch. an older man, probably in his 60s, and his son probably mid 40s.the dad was quiet, didnt bother you, just wanted his food. the son on the other hand who (relevant to the story) was confined to a wheel chair, (my guess is he had a stroke, or possibly brain damage judging by his slurred speech.) was a huge creep. 

they always requested a particular table, one of maybe 5 that were wheelchair accessible, so they didnt request me that often, but i did happen to get that section a lot. the creep would keep me there talking for any reason under the sun as long as he could. saying inappropriate things and asking inappropriate questions. im cute, my hair was beautiful, he loved blondes, did i have a boyfriend, how old was i ? (yes he knew), i looked old for my age, did i have a boyfriend? the list goes on. 

i deal with my fair share of creeps, so at first i could deal. smile, nod, get away asap. then it just got worse and worse over time. he would stop before being seated to talk to me (if i hadn't already ran to the back), then after ordering would follow me anywhere he could throughout the restaurant. i tried my best to stay in the boh when he was there without neglecting tables. everyone noticed his behavior, my coworkers told me he used to do the same thing to another girl that used to work there before me. i dealt with this for far too long until this one particular sunday afternoon.

i was in a section, quite literally on the opposite side of the restaurant from where he was seated, doing fills and closing it down since we were considerably less busy at night. the closing manager, my agm, (who i really got a long with and wasnt usually at the store in time to witness creeps behavior) was seated at one of the tables doing paperwork. creep comes all the way over to my section to do what he does and be creepy. this time he gives me a piece of paper with his address and phone number on it, and goes on this whole rant about how hes just lonely and wants to go out with me some times, just as friends tho. i do my usual, smile, nod, tell him thanks or whatever the hell i could manage as a response. we go to part ways (i go to hide) and as i turn around my agm is looking quite irritated and asks me what creep was saying. i show him the piece of paper and tell him what he said. i explain how he constantly is creepy towards me. i almost kind of laugh it off as it's a constant occurrence for me. he tells me if creep keeps bothering me, let him know. i agree. 

i hide in the back for awhile before deciding i should probably go finish what i was doing. i go back to the same section i was closing where my agm was sitting. i start doing my thing, and here comes creep again.  he starts saying something about making sure i can read the address and number. i don't remember exactly what was said. as he goes back to his table i look at my agm with an 'are you seeing this shit' type look. he asks me again what he said, i reiterate, and he says hes going to talk to him. 

i am not one for confrontation. so i am very nervous and hide back on dish as my agm walks over to him. i wasnt out there to hear but was told my agm said (as politely and stern as possible) that he can not keep bothering/ harassing his servers like this, making us uncomfortable. that i am underage and simply here to do my job. the creep started going off on my agm, saying he was just talking to me whatever, whatever. my agm repeats himself and walks away. 

my agm is back on the server line, behind the counter seats when creep apparently decides he had more to say. he comes up and starts screaming at my agm. i dont remember exactly what was said but he was causing a huge scene. at this point me and the dishwasher hear the commotion and he walks up front with me to see what was going on. my agm basically tells him he needs to go sit down &amp; he will not tolerate him talking to him that way. creep is still yelling when my agm just turns around and goes to the back. i follow, he tells me hes going to call the cops and i continue to hide out til they arrive. i eventually have to go out for one reason or another and at this point the police are there asking creep to leave. he starts screaming at the police and trying  his fucking hardest to kick them from his fucking wheel chair. up until this point i didnt even think dude could lift his legs and here he is kicking and screaming at the police. i was blown. 

i run to the back again, they eventually arrest him, his dad says not a word and pays their bill and leaves. they're obviously not allowed back and i haven't seen them in years thankfully. 

what really fucking gets me is another one of my managers at the time (who i also love and continue to see on occasion) calls me into the office about an hour later and has google maps on the computer screen. this bored motherfucker, looked up creeps address on the paper he gave me on google maps. in the street view picture theres a fucking cop car outside of his house. we both fucking lost it. clearly this guy gets into shit pretty often. who knows when that picture was taken and what are the fucking odds. 

so happy ending, all in all. still haven't seen creep to this day and now have added this to my collection of stories working there.

957,customer told my co-worker that i suck,"i work in a small family owned restaurant in my small town. wednesday's is one of our busiest nights because we have half price beer all night long. all the servers choose to split on this night to make it ""easier"" so getting tables is a free-for-all rather than having everyone stay in sections and actually making it easier. everyone feels like they have to take every table they can so that they don't wind up being the ""low man"" in tips. i had a 10 top and about four other tables, one being regulars that come in every single wednesday night like clockwork. i had a guy walk in to eat alone, no problem. i sat him immediately and got him a drink, he said he needed some time to look at the menu so i went to roll some silverware and got lost in the zone. i was admittedly having an off night, i didn't feel on my game at all. i went over to the guy and apologized for taking a little longer, letting him know i got distracted rolling silverware. he said no problem and ordered. his food came out quickly and the runner ran his food over to him. i checked on him a little bit later to see if he needed another drink and he said everything was perfect. i started talking to the couple who are wednesday night regulars, i'm pretty close with them but they're an older couple and the man had fallen two days prior and had to get stitches. they were telling me the story about their time spent in the er and i got held up is this conversation because i felt it would be rude to them to pull away mid story. so my co-worker offered to drop the check off for the guy dining alone and i was super grateful. she ran his card and brought the ticket back over for him to sign and he asked for her name. she told him and he responded by saying ""alright, next time i come in here i am asking for you, because she (talking about me) sucks!!!"" 

it bothered me. because i was nominated for best server in my state this past year, so i know i don't suck. but again, i was having an off night. and this guy, felt the need to make a rude comment to my co-worker instead of giving me the benefit of the doubt. i felt like he could have just said he would prefer to have my co-worker next time and left out the part that he thinks i suck. especially after realizing who he was and knowing he actually owns a restaurant down the street. of all people you would think that someone else in the same business would be a little understanding. 

  
my co-worker only told me what he said thinking i would get a chuckle out of it, but it actually did hurt my feelings. i'm a sensitive person, i realize that, but still... his comments were not necessary in my opinion.

i’ve talked to all my friends about this and they say they can pull in $30-$80 a night! which to me is insane. they are making minimum wage just like me as well

959,customer gave 1-star review because she doesn't understand what last call is,"the purpose of last call isn't to tell you you have x amounts of minutes to eat before we kick you out, you ignoramus, it's to inform you that the kitchen is going to close and we are giving you the fucking chance to order additional items before the kitchen officially turns everything off and all kitchen staff goes home for the night. i don't know if this is her first time ever eating at a restaurant close to close but doing last call is standard in all restaurants. we've done last call all. the. time and no customer has ever complained about this before because they know that just because we are doing last call, it doesn't mean we literally force everyone to pay up and get out by our posted closing time. we're also not pressuring you to hurry up because again, it's just to let you order anything from the kitchen last minute, including desserts, before they close up. 

edit: btw this wasnt during my shift but during my sister's shift and she wasnt the one the review was complaining about since she wasn't the one going around doing last call, and from what i learned from the people who were working that shift, the server who went around doing last call apologized to the customer if she felt rushed and it wasn't their intention since they do last call all the time, but she still decided to bitch about it.

960,“but it’s my birthday!!!”,"so backstory i’m a server at an upscale japanese hibachi restaurant, which means the chefs cook on the table in front of the customers. on the weekends, all the servers usually have 2 tables at a time, which each table has 8 people so it can be a lot to deal with. well i was incredibly busy already, and i had an elderly couple at one of the tables. they were incredibly rude and needy the entire time but oh well, it happens. well the rest of their table leaves, and they just stay there not saying anything. eventually, i go over and get the check from them, kinda like a cue that they need to leave bc we have people waiting to sit. well they didn’t get the memo, and continued to sit. to make it worse, they stiffed me. but it gets better. about 5 minutes after i realized they stiffed me, the old man calls me over and has the audacity to say “it’s my birthday, id like my free dessert now.” ru kidding me? worst table ever

962,loves ordering from a host.,"so i’m a frequent reader of this sub but have never posted but a recent read got me thinking and surfaced a memory from valentines last week.

i had the joyous opportunity to be the maître d/host on valentine’s day at a pretty decently sized restaurant here in nz (by our standards.) for the first half an hour after i started it was pretty uneventful and i didn’t need a float so i would sit people myself and open their tabs. as time progresses i glue myself to the door and refused to leave as any md will understand. 

at some point someone calls me over to take my order and i look around like deer in headlights trying to find wait staff to swap out with. unfortunately there were none in sight so i resign myself to this order. once i sheepishly scurry back to front i vow to never leave again. 

later on to my dismay this lady rocks up. i give her the spiel about the wait and to grab drinks from the bar and i’ll get them a table as soon as it’s their turn. now lovey lady (ll) comes up moments later to check the wait time, again, and again. eventually she asks me if she can eat  asap despite being a obvious line out the door. 

i stick to my guns and tell her my lines, but now the ll has had a brilliant idea! she wants to eat in what i’ll call the holding pen for the night, where there are no waitstaff on. i tell her this, and almost cry as look down to my notebook full with pages of the particulars of the tables to be sat. 

again i decline, saying i can’t leave the door, but again she has a solution! she knows what she wants to order. i give in. in hushed tones so as to not cause outrage at the queue jumping i take order, nip to a pos to order and get someone to run her a cutlery box. 

i hope she enjoyed the extra twenty minutes on valentine’s day!

963,crazy salad lady,"long time lurker first time poster.

  i've been in the pizza biz for ten years and i have seen a lot of insane people come through my small town location.  we run a popular buffet with a salad bar and many characters.  one in particular is known as crazy salad lady.  she would come in twice a month.  eat her entire salad then refuse to  pay.  in this particular instance i had set up the salad bar with all fresh produce and stock that was received in the morning so i know that was a kick ass salad bar.  i take pride in it.  sad. 

 so crazy salad lady comes in.  my server and i exchange glances and roll our eyes.  after she eats her salad she asks for the manager.  knowing full well that i am the manager.  she screams at me, ""you call this a carrot?!"". while sticking the carrot in my face.  super rude.  at this point the dining room is full of regulars and families and i just was done with her.  i asked her calmly if she hates the salad bar so much, why does she continues to come here?  she loses her mind at this point.  screaming about a soggy onion.  i tell her she doesn't have to pay, please leave and don't return.  she proceeded to scream at me, ""well you're a big fat pig!"". whole dining room is quite and starting at this point.  she exits.  one of the regulars comes up to ask what i did to her laughing at the absurdity.  i said i gave her a free salad.  the dining room laughed awkwardly and continued to eat.  

 it was actually pretty funny once i got over the embarrassment of it all.  four years later, crazy salad lady now only orders for delivery and never complains.  a win?

i have been serving for 5 years now, so i’ve seen a lot. food allergies? no problem. communication is key. but i’ve had this older lady come in a couple times now- and when she orders she tells me she has allergies. both times i say, “that’ll be fine, what are your allergies” this freakin bat proceeds to tell me “everything. i am allergic to everything.” 

both times i’m in my head like ok why are you here trying to eat then if you’re allergic to everything. turns out she’s not, though. just orders a plain burger, no bun no seasoning, and requests 3 fruits that are only served during breakfast so i go back in the cooler and cut them myself. like cool i get allergies, but if you really wanna keep yourself safe, print out an effing list, keep it in your wallet, and give it to me so i can give it to the chef, so we dont kill you.

967,fake outrage for free food can have consequences for your servers. i ultimately quit because of a customers lie.,"i was a newbie. i had hosted for 2 years at this point but i finally got a job as a server at a semi-corporate place. i was so very excited. i loved serving and even the busiest of nights never bothered me. attention to detail is important to me, and instantly the gm liked me because of how well i did as a rookie. she was notorious for being crazy and strict and no one liked her. but, she liked me. 

up until this night i had absolutely no issues ever. it had only been a couple of weeks but i never had a complaint and any problems that occurred were fixable and from what i could tell all my customers were happy when they left. i even got a few regulars tell me i was the best service they got there. which really meant the world to me. as time went on i started getting really good shifts. and, i was making good money. i loved the job, and the customers. 

until one lady came in. she was with her parents and two of her children. the parents were extremely nice, and i love kid so i had no issue buddying up with them. she was off from the bringing though. she was maybe in her 30s. she did not look up to me when she ordered her drink. she told her mother to shut up when she was trying to ask me about a deal we had. when i started explaining the deal anyway she snapped again “you can see the deal on the menu, i don’t know what your asking her!” i did not want to upset her anymore, so i point to where it said the deal and the mother nodded. 

i bring back the drinks and admittedly i did make a small mistake. she has originally ordered a lemonade but before i walked away she changed her mind to a water. i nodded, but the interaction previously kinda threw me off and i brought her the lemonade by mistake. she was the last drink i put down and instantly when i reach down to give it to her i realize the mistake. i go to pick it up and apologize but before i can she huffs in disgust “i told you i wanted a water not a lemonade!” she yelled aggressively. i nervously laughed it off and blamed myself, i told her i must have been in autopilot and i would fix this right away. she asks if she will be charged for the lemonade, i have not rung in drinks yet so i assure her that no she will not. 

all else is calm and i’m taking care of other tables before their food comes out. her and her mother ordered burgers. i hand out all the plates and they all begin eating. after a couple minutes i check back and ask how everything is. the daughter is completely silent. the mother looks kind of worried and hesitantly says her burger is over cooked, she wanted medium but it was well done. i profusely apologize and take a look, it was a little more on the brown side. i tell her i will have her another made and i will get my manager. then the daughter pipes up and says hers is wrong also. i repeat my apologies and tell them the manager will fix the problem (aka take the burgers off the order) while i get them new burgers. the mother insisted i don’t do that, she would just eat her burger there was no issue. to my surprise the daughter says nothing. i ask again is she sure she does not want a new burger, she once again repeats that no neither of them do. 

i still go to my manager and explain the situation. she comps the meals and gives them a free desert. i happily tell them this news and the mother seems really thankful. still, nothing from the daughter. 

the mother tips me 20% and all else seems well. the daughter did not look at me for the rest of the meal, but she also didn’t snap or yell at me. she did yell at her children a few times for minor things, rather loudly and aggressively. but, she seemed calmer. 

the next day i come onto work i get called into the back by a manager and my gm. they ask me if i know what it’s about. i confusingly say no, i don’t. they stare at me sternly, not believing me. i ask them what happened, and if i did something wrong. i had never seen my gm mad at me about anything before. 

“explain what happened last night with that table with the burgers” she tells me. it took me a couple seconds to remember what she meant. it hadn’t been something that stood out to me because it was a rather minuscule situation. but, i tell her what happened about the burgers being overcooked and me getting a manager to comp them. she then pulls out a paper with a really long paragraph. she hands it to me and tells me to read it out loud. 

basically it was the biggest character assassination i ever knew possible. it was all written by the daughter. she said i was rude, called me a bitch, and said i acted like they were a nuisance and a waste of my time. i talked down on her when i said “excuse me honey” when she spoke. the only time i had said that was to her son when i reached over to hand her her water after the lemonade situation. not to her, and not condescending. she told them her burger was burnt and she couldn’t eat it. dispute her finishing it. she told them i rolled my eyes when she complained. and i took 30 minutes to give them a check, which was also not true. all i had to do was get the manager to comp the meals, and her mother was given the check before their meal was completely finished and desert was brought out. she also said i charged her for a lemonade she never ordered. i know i didn’t, but even if i had why wouldn’t she have said something then?

apparently my gm had called her the next morning and they were on the phone for an hour. and, my gm couldn’t even get a word in because the lady was so angered she was screaming the whole conversation. by this time i was crying, i hate to admit that but i had no defense. i had no proof none of this was true. and, despite all my good reviews they believed her. maybe not fully, but they said there was no one someone was that mad if i had done nothing wrong. they made me read a paper on their policy of treating customers. they told me i am not allowed to call anyone honey. and, what hurt the most was, they told me they might have overestimated my abilities on handling myself. and, that i would be put back in the smallest 3 table section. 

ultimately my hours dropped. and, the gm no longer liked me. no matter how good i did after that my reputation never recovered. i was forced to find another job. without them as a reference i had no documentable serving experience, so i had to work my way up and a different place now. i make significantly less money, even a year later, than i would have there. all because she complained and got another free meal. she practically ruined my life over burgers. 



edit: thank you for the support!!! it’s so encouraging read kind comments and it feels like at least reddit has my back on this situation... lol. i no longer work at this place. and i have never had a situation this bad ever happen to me since. i genuinely love serving and i really do not get overwhelmed or angry about much. this place has other locations that have shut down at a high rate over the last couple years, and that should have been a warning sign before i began working at this location.

edit 2: also i kinda realize that i think this was a little bit more of an elaborate scam than i thought at the time. the fact she didn’t speak up in front of her parents makes me believe she wanted to cause a scene after the fact. the mother was pretty insistent that she did not want to get free food and i was actually the one who asked the manager to comp it, the mother never asked me to do that. makes me think that since the daughter remained quite up until they left means she wanted to take more advantage of the situation behind everyone else’s back.

973,called the cops over 9 dollars," (cross posted from /r/choosingbeggars at the suggestion of a commenter.)

when i was in high school, i worked at a restaurant. at the restaurant, if you ordered a dinner, you normally got a free salad bar, and at our establishment, this also included the vegetables on the hot bar.

one night, a couple came in late and ordered drinks and steak dinners (well done). i explained that the salad bar was at their disposal and brought out their drinks. they were both rude to me, but i was used to this behavior at the time. when you serve tables, getting treated like shit just comes with the job.

they had two plates each off the bar by the time their steaks came out. keep in mind this was late at night and they were the only ones there. they didnt have to wait very long for their dinners. as soon as i put the steaks down, the wife cut it with her steak knife and said that the steaks were too tough.

i asked if they wanted the kitchen to recook them, but they said no, they just wanted to cancel the order. i took the plates back to the kitchen and told the manager, who proceeded to pull apart the steak with her hands. it wasn't tough at all. customers did this sometimes. our district manager was notorious for giving free stuff away. most customers would run you to death and then when they got up to the register, they would demand discounts.

as was our policy, i changed the ticket to charge them for only salad bars and removed the steaks. when i brought the check to the table, they said no, we arent paying anything tonight. i explained the policy and said since you ate off the salad bar, i have to charge you for it.

they made the biggest ruckus ever over that check. it was only eight or nine dollars but they acted like we were doing them so wrong. everyone on staff was upset. the restaurant was empty, and we were all there after close dealing with these people. the manager tried to explain it to them but they said they were not paying and that was final.

the manager was done. she said if they left without paying she would call the police.

they left. the manager told me to follow them out and get their license plate number. i made a busboy go out with me because i was only 17 and scared of everyone. the manager called the police. the cbs heard the manager and walked past their car in the lot. i guess they were just going to leave it behind and come back later.

but here's the thing... we were in a small town and i guess the police didn't have a lot going on. because i had only stepped a few steps into the parking lot when three cop cars pulled in and surrounded them. it was like a scene out of a movie and i'm so happy i got to witness it.

they marched the cbs right back in and made them pay their bill. the whole time the wife was crying and saying ""called the cops over 9 dollars! who does that?!""

and the manager stood there smug and said they were not welcome back.

as soon as i turn down the music, the construction people working on the ramp leading up to the bar start power-sawing the metal railings which is much louder and obnoxious than any music. i laughed to myself and hoped they would be sawing for the rest of the shift. ",omfgdeb,tfys
977,some people just really need that beer,"so excuse my formatting or spelling, or basically anything else i might do annoyingly in this post as this is the first time posting!  


alright, so. i work as a bartender in norway. in the city i work in, there are laws regarding when we're allowed to serve a customer from the bar. the sale ends at 2 am, done, and we're not allowed to announce ""last call"" because it's illegal to promote alcohol purchase in any setting.  there is absolutely no way around it. naturally, every night we do then get  at least a couple of customers asking ""just oooone more beer?"", but when you say no, they usually just move on.   


this past weekend the 2 am mark hit and i started cleaning the bar, and up walks an extreme case.   
i will call him s for sober. 

&amp;#x200b;

s: ""hey, can i have a pint?""  
me: ""no, i'm sorry, we just closed the sale a couple of minutes ago.""  
s: ""seriously? how was i supposed to know that? i've been here for 10 minutes and just now got around to the bar thinking i had time. you don't close for another half an hour, just let me buy a beer!""  
me: ""the pub closes in half an hour, indeed, but we're not allowed to sell you anything after 2 am. that's just unfortunately how the laws are here. i'm sorry for the inconvenience.""  
s: ""well, that's no fair, you can't stop selling without giving me a chance to buy something first! it's just a beer! can't you let it slip this one time? i've had a very long day, and just wanted to have a beer instead of sitting at home, it's not my fault it's late!""  
me: ""i'm afraid it's not up to me-""  
s: ""of course it is, just bend the law one time! it's not like the police are here!""  


at this point he's getting louder and louder, and so my manager comes over.   


m: "" is everything okay here?""  
s: ""this b\*tch won't just sell me a simple beer! it's not my fault that i f\*cking walked up to the bar like 2 minutes too late!""  
m: ""sir, we've got laws that's out of our control. we simply can not. but you can have a glass of water.""  
s: ""if i wanted a f\*cking glass of water, i could have gotten it myself!""  


s is now getting up in my managers face, and so he decides to escort him out while i watch. s wouldn't have none of that, and proceeded to conveniently attempt to tackle my manager to run back to me. just then the security guards get a hold of this, and run over. with some resistance from s, they manage to get him out.   
my manager then walks back to me and just goes ""some people just really need that beer...""",Theodosiah,tfys
978,the worlds dumbest manager has sent me over the edge,"okay, so i work at this little german restaurant in small-town texas. this place isn't the worst place, most of the managers range from awesome to tolerable, which is a lot better than some. the only one i can't freaking stand is one, who is the literal dumbest person i've ever met. he's an owner and that is the only reason he hasn't been fired because nobody else can stand him. for the sake of this story well call him nitwit.

alright so at my restaurant i work as a hostess most days and a server only when they need one and have no other options. on the days when i'm hosting nitwit runs me ragged, constantly making me do stupid thing when they're not even my job all the while people are getting tired of waiting for me at the podium and seating themselves because i'm helping him unload a beer shipment. 

now don't get me wrong, i'm a great hostess. i keep track of rotation, i always tell the servers when i seat them, and anytime i have a chance i’ll help bus tables, roll silverware, and when it gets busy i’ll fill drinks, great guests, and do quilty checks for them. but when i'm busy running around trying to do everything i can to help while doing my own job, and nitwit comes up to me and orders me to separate tables, expo an order, roll silverware, or ask me some dumb question he should already know the answer to, i get pissed. but i never do anything because he's the owner and virtually untouchable. yesterday almost broke me though.

like i said i only serve when the restaurant needs me which is maybe once or twice a month and almost always in the morning. this place i work at is almost always dead so i don't have much experience when it comes to being busy and weeded. this morning though was so extremely busy for no reason and we were unprepared. me and this one other girl were on the floor and she was an amazing server. shes got almost ten years of serving experience and could handle 10 tables before even letting on she was weeded. well call her ace

this day she had a 14 top in our party room along with about 5 other tables and i had around 9. we were so deep in the weeds it wasn't even funny. both of us were running around all over the place when the host comes up to me and tells me there is going to be an 8 top in about 30 minutes. well shit. at that point, i had just been sat and i still needed to make a salad for an order that was almost up, so i stop nitwit as he's the only one whos not busy and ask him to please make it for me. this dumb ass looks me in the eye and tells me he doesn't know how to make the salad. he's the freaking owner/manager and he doesn't know how to make our basic salad. the recipe was literally on the wall next to the salad bar. our freaking dishwasher knew how to make it and offered to do it for me.

i'm running around trying to get caught up when nitwit starts to chat me up near the dish pit.

nitwit- wow i guess it turned into a pretty decent lunch.

me- haha yeah but i kinda hope it slows down before this 8 top comes in.

nitwit- did you really just say that. are you really gonna be like that right now?

me- i just don't think me and ace can really handle it right now.

nitwit- ace is our best server she could handle this whole restaurant if she wanted to. 

me- maybe but she's in the weeds right now too because of that big party.

nitwit- look just give it to ace if you don't think you can handle it.

me- i honestly think she could handle it less than me right now.

nitwit walks away at this point and i go about my business. i was pretty frustrated by then because nitwit had never been rude to me like that before, just annoying, but whatever. i kept saying stuff like “i'm not a good enough server to deal with a day like this” or “someone needs to teach me to handle more than 1 table” throughout the day but i meant them mostly as jokes.

so at one point, this girls card got declined. this is my first time with a declined card so i'm not entirely sure how to handle it. so i simply run it one more time, and when it declines again i ask for another form of payment. that one goes through so i take the check, ask her to sign, and tell her to have a great day. when she leaves i go to close out her payment on the computer and it's telling me i can't close it out because the payment is unapproved despite the fact it's showing the balance is zero. i tell nitwit about this and ask what's up. he says he has no idea and to give him a moment and he’d ask around for me. he should already know but it's fine, he's gonna find out for me, no big deal.

he comes back like 20 minutes later and tells me that that card was also declined and i’d need to ask for another one. i tell him that it wasn't declined and that the balanced owed was zero and showed him on the computer. he insisted i needed to ask for another card. i told him that she already left because her card was approved and her meal was paid for. he said i was wrong and that i would need to cover it since i let her leave without paying. i freaking knew he was wrong because like i said he is the dumbest person i know. so i walk over to ace and ask her. she says all i have to do is highlight the declined charges and press delete on the screen. again, hes the freaking owner and should know that. whatever i guess we all know he's dumb so i just go tell him i fixed it, explained it, and moved on.

tables stop coming in and its starting to slow down. i’m in the server station trying to get drinks when ace walks up to me and asks if i could take the newest table because she just got triple sat with one of them being the 8 top. i walked up to the host to ask him why he triple sat ace and didn't seat me at all, and he said that nitwit asked him to stop seating me and to only seat ace. alright wtf. i tell ace and she is pissed because she was already in the weeds and only took the tables because she thought i needed her to and because that's just a crapy thing to do.

at this point i'm pretty pissed but like i said he's the owner so what is anyone going to do. it dies pretty quick after that so i’m doing my side work and starting to input my credit card tips. when i get cut i run my checkout and organize my receipts. now our tipout always includes 2 people, the busser and the bartender. we didn't have a busser that day so i had to divide the tipout by 2 and subtract it from the money i owed the restaurant, which took the money i owed them from 5 bucks down to like 17 cents. suuuuper basic math that all of our managers should know how to do.

i go into our manager's office, hand in my receipts, my signed checkout, and my 17 cents. this dumb bitch tries to tell me i still owe 5. i literally have to go through and explain the whole process to him of why i divided and subtracted. once that's done he tries to tell me i did my math wrong. i tell him that i used a calculator to double check and that it wasn't. after like 5 minutes of me explaining to him we figure out he was confused because me owing the restaurant 5 dollars was listed as -$5.00 on the checkout and wanted to know why i added the $4.43 if that money belonged to me and i should have subtracted it. i had to explain basic integers to this 55-year-old man. basic 8th-grade math and this idiot didn't get that you had to add in order to subtract. he still didn't get it in the end but accepted i was probably right and took my 17 cents.

now, here's the kicker. after all of this nitwit has the nerve to tell me “look from now on when you serve you need to tell the host to seat you once and the other server twice until you get the hang of serving. i’d much rather you take 2-3 tables and do a good job then take 6-7 and embarrass the restaurant. youll get the hang of it but you need more practice.”

i. was. furious. all but one of my tips that day had been between 18-26 percent. one table told me they would ask for me by name next time. another told me they could tell i was busy and thought i was handling everything very well and tipped me110 percent. i was serving my tables fine. people liked me and my service. i was stressed out and weeded not a bad employee or an embarrassment. i was so embarrassed and pissed off. i had never wanted to yell at my superiors so badly before, and i almost did. until i remembered. 

he was the owner and there's nothing anyone could do about it.

so i counted my money, declared my tips, clocked out, and went to apologize to ace for not being a good partner. ace said she thought i did just fine, she only suggest i pay more attention to refilling drinks and said i balanced everything pretty well for that being one of my first busy serving shifts.

i went thanked her, i went out to my car, and as much as i hate to admit it, i cried. because i was embarrassed that i wasn't better and sad that i ran my ass off for 4 hours and was told it wasn't enough by some rich incompetent asshole who should even have a job. i went in today and made sure my gm (who i love) knew what happened, from him not knowing basic things like how to make a salad or the procedure of a declined card, to him actually cheating me out of tips by telling the host to not seat me and then trying to cheat me again by not understanding how our tip share works, and then straight up calling me a bad server. he said he would talk to him and i told him there was no point and to just make sure the other managers know so they don't believe him if he tries to slander me to them.

i typical really like my job when nitwit isn't there but idk yesterday was kind of the last straw. i'm currently looking for a new job out of the restaurant industry and in the one is currently in school for so wish me luck i guess.",ProjectRelic,tfys

980,"the time (this morning) when the confused old racist guy let everyone know he was racist, is given facts, yet is still confused.","i serve breakfast at a popular local joint, and the owner hosts a veterans breakfast every tuesday morning.  it's free coffee and half price, sometimes free, breakfast for anyone who has served in the us military.  it's very popular; we usually fill the 90 seat side dining room with vets from all walks of life and all branches of the military.  there are always announcements and visits from dignitaries and service organizations, and this morning, one of the guys gave a brief presentation, in costume, about the buffalo soldiers.

&amp;#x200b;

confused old racist guy (corg) was sitting at a front table that i walk by every trip into the dining room and he sat there apparently fuming during the whole presentation.  near the end, the very large black marine who gave the presentation asked if there were any questions, and corg raised his hand and hollered out ""i gotta question: why do i get in trouble every time i say the word 'black'? why can't we say black anymore?""  i watched the marine (a vietnam vet) pause, shake his head, and reply ""i'll have to get back to you on that one"" and move on to a germane question.  at least 30% of the folks there were people of color, and there was a bunch of head shaking going on, but everyone could see that he was just a corg and didn't really mean any harm, so he was left to finish his gross bacon and chicken liver omelet in peace.

&amp;#x200b;

later, the marine told me he went and sat with corg after breakfast and assured him that it wasn't his use of the word 'black' about black folks that was a problem, it was his attitude.  corg continued to assert that he was being oppressed because he just got in trouble the other day for calling someone a chinaman.  the marine told him, too bad, you're wrong and you have to learn the new way of being respectful, which is calling people what they want to be called.  corg stomped out angrily and we hope he doesn't come back, but if he does, we'll still be nice to him because he's just confused and old and racism is a ~~mental disability.~~  

edit: i really don't know why i said mental disability, i usually know better than that.  racism is a chosen, asshole behavior and not a disability.  this customer, however, does seem to suffer from dementia and i in-artfully and insensitively conflated the two.  ",grannybubbles,tfys
981,last table makes a huge mess and leaves a shit tip.,"so this happened on sunday, i opened the restaurant and therefore was first off after the lunch rush. ever since football ended we've been getting fairly busy on sundays but not until like 1:45 or so. so come noon it's been a standard ""constant trickle"" kind of day, four servers on and no one is having to move too fast. manager is hesitant to cut me because she's waiting on the late rush.




turns out that was a smart move, because we got really busy really fast. all my tables were great! i was happy to have stayed around because i was making great tips and everyone was super easy. as the rush is slowing down, a younger couple and their baby are sat at my big table, and i'm told they're expecting more people to arrive. no worries! they order some drinks and settle in. but now all my other tables are starting to close out and it's looking like i'm going to be stuck with this one last big top. my manager notices and seats me with another 4 top to keep me busy. they know what they want and order food and drinks all at the same time- perfect. 




right around when this 4 top's food comes out the rest of my big table arrives. it's another mom with two toddlers and an older woman who turns out to be grandma. total of seven people at a table for 12, this happens sometimes, no worries. the toddlers kinda spread their wings and begin to do their thing doodling on the kids menus. 




i go and greet the rest of my big top, they seem like super nice people, it's all family catching up over lunch, very pleasant. at this point i'm basically just bussing my older tables and finishing up any side work. i've been cut so they're my only table and i'm super attentive. i help then with bloody mary's and lemonades for the kids. they're appetizers come out super fast, and they even order their food pretty quick and since lunch is over now the kitchen isn't busy and their entree's come out quick as well. 




we do a little snack plate for young kids and the second mom had ordered one for her younger kid. she opted not to get the black olives and instead more turkey because since she doesn't like black olives she doesn't think her daughter will. when i bring out the snack plate i brought along a small ramekin with a few black olives as well. when i sat the plate down in front of the mom i gave her the olives too ""for science!"" she giggled at that, and later when i came by the little girl was going at those olives like there was no tomorrow! the mom thanked me for bringing them out so the girl could try them. 




so overall, great service. brought out boxes when they  were slowing down. pre bussed all their plated. grandma leans in and says she'll take the whole check. dope. so i bring it to her and thank them for coming in, blah blah you know the rest. 




so now i'm just doing busy work waiting for them to leave. it's around 3:30 at this point which is pretty late for me, as the day's opener, to still be there. but hey, they had a large bill, i should make some money off them, whatever.




they finally get up to leave and say goodbye on their way out. grandma gives me a big smile and thank you, both moms apologize for the ""huge mess."" i tell them no worries, we have brooms! it's all fine and dandy.




now i go to bus their table and good god they are right about the ""huge mess."" i mean it's typical kid shit- food on the floor, kid menus shredded and tossed like confetti, one spilled kids drink- nothing out of the ordinary. just a lot of it.  then i go to pick up the check. 




five percent. grandma tipped me five percent. on an almost $200 check. we do a six percent tip out, so basically i just paid to take care of these people. cool. 




a co-worker of mine helps me bus the table it so it's a quick enough clean up and i'm almost off, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. i'm mostly bummed because it had been such a good lunch and i felt like i was rocking it and this was just a sudden and complete stop to my good roll. 




but wait! as i'm bringing back a tray full of their glasses in one hand and a stack of their plates in the other, mom number two comes running back in the restaurant. i'm right near the front door so she sees me instantly and says, ""hey! we just realized we left you a shit tip!"" she's holding some rolled up cash but my hands are completely full. so she just reaches on over and tucks it into my apron- right in the middle pocket. ""thanks for the great service!"" she yells as she runs back out the front door. it all happened so quick i barely had the sense to yell thank you back at her as she left. 




she ended up leaving me with a 20% tip so in total they gave me 25% which is dope, but i couldn't help feeling a little like a stripper when she tucked the money right into my crotch area. it was sweet though, and the way she did it so quickly and confidently made me laugh to myself later. 




anyway, thanks random mom lady for not only showing me tip appreciation but also for the funny moment. it's nice when you can end your day with a good one.

982,two guys try to pull a fast one on me and it fails miserably,"so i work at a tavern that attracts some lowly people because of our location and atmosphere. makes no difference to me, i’ve learned how to deal with shitty low life’s while keeping my good customers happy. 

yesterday afternoon 2 guys and a girl come in, the guys order 2 double shots of jameson while the girl just got a root beer. the guys were obviously over 21 but they looked sketchy so i carded them thinking one of them wouldn’t have their ids on them. turns out i was right! i let the guy without the id know that i can’t serve him, no problem. i turn around to pour the shot for the one with the id and then the one without said he found his id. great! i asked for it and he holds it out to me with his thumb over the picture. i grabbed it out of his hand and he actually handed me the id from the other guy.. who i had just carded.. and who was not of the same skin color in the slightest. i then asked them if they really thought i’m that stupid. they played the innocence card. i turned around to ignore them and in doing so i heard the guy that was served his double shot take a drink and set the glass back down. he had taken half of the double shot and then had the balls to try to tell me i only poured a single shot! after that i told them that they could now leave. the one with the id throws a fit and asked if i would still serve him. i said absolutely not, i’m not putting up with that shit. they continued their fit, whatever i ignored their whines and cries. after that they were in and out, in and out and had asked me to call a cab for them. in that time they made multiple remarks under their breath cursing me and calling me names. i ignored it until i couldn’t anymore and told them to walk out the door and not come back in. this ensued an outrage! how dare i ask them to leave and not come back, surely i don’t have this power! one of the guys tries to challenge me and asked how i (a 100 some pound girl) planned to make him leave. at this point my 3 cooks in the kitchen, 2 guys at a table, 1 guy sitting at the bar, and another guy from the back area all prepare to get involved. i informed the stubborn, now unwelcome guest that i have about 7 guys ready to kick his ass and that i would either have them remove him or i could call the cops. at the mention of cops they scurried out the door.

fast forward about 15 minutes and guess who pops in the door again! i yelled out “absolutely not!” and picked up the phone to start dialing the cops, at this point i got a prompt “fuck you!” and an obnoxious door slam. what a start to my week. ",thefredwest,tfys

984,entitled 10-top.,"ok. ok. i’m kind of cheating i’m actually a host but there’s no r/talesfromyourhost. also sorry for the format i’m on mobile.

so i work at a chain-steakhouse restaurant that has a call ahead feature instead of reservations so we can know what parties to get ready for. we have a very small party section and we get a lot of large parties on saturdays which can get a long wait especially if you do not call ahead (upwards of 2 hours if you don’t call ahead on a saturday) 

so on a busy saturday night that had all the party sections filled and a lot of call-aheads of large parties, so a 10-top comes in and i ask if they called ahead and they said no, so i tell them it’s going to be a long wait probably around 1 1/2 hours and obviously i got the “what the hell why so long?” and i explained the situation and they finally backed off and said that they’ll wait. 

30 minutes later they came up to the host stand and said that they have been waiting way too long and they needed to be seated immediately, again i explained the situation to them.

15 minutes later they saw that a dirty table that could accommodate them and they came up to the host stand and yelled at us that “we are getting that table or else.” again i explained that a party that was waiting longer than them that was getting that table and the wait shouldn’t be too much longer of a wait. 

i look over to see if that table was ready for our next table to be sat and i see that they sat themselves at that table. i was pissed i went to get a manager to tell them to get the hell up but instead of telling them to get up he got them free apps for their wait. ",JiggleyWafflez,tfys
985,i caught a couple dining and dashing on me!!,"our restaurant has two parts, the full restaurant, and the “waiting bar” that’s in a different room.  if you’re bartending in the waiting room, you’re your own busser/server/bartender. people can order a couple of apps and drinks while they wait for their buzzer to go off. last nights dinner rush was about a 2 hour wait. i was bartending in the waiting room. 

the couple comes in and sits at a table, off the bat they’re weird because it was pulling teeth getting their order.  i finally get it and continue with my busy ass night.  everything is going as smooth as can be until they start their plan.

i notice that she pulls her wallet from her purse and goes out the door presumably to the bathroom. (it’s located around the corner from the building) no big deal. i’m still wheeln’ and deeln’, bussing tables, making drinks and deliver food.  

that’s when i notice dude is no longer at the table but the purse is still on a chair. hmmmm. i do a thing or two more and then print their ticket, put it in a book, and then go to the purse. it’s empty. like just an empty bag. i pick it up and go to find one of them around the corner thinking maybe dude just went to the restroom. (it’s been about 5-10 minutes since the chick was in the restaurant)

when i round the corner he’s a good 50-60 yards past the restroom on the way to the parking lot. not wanting to accuse them i shout out, “hey man, you guys forgot your purse, and tab”.

that’s when the guy takes off so i start sprinting after him. we get to the parking lot and he’s running to a car that i can now see she’s waiting in. still running i pull my phone out and start snapping picks of the car. we both get there and i say, “go ahead and take off on your tab, it’ll be worse for you once the cops show up to your house!” 

they don’t leave, she walks back and pays her $63 dollar tab, stiffs me on the tip and leaves. fuck them, i still consider that a win.  decoy purse....holy shit.  scumbags. 


edit:  i get it, it can be dangerous to chase someone for a tab. i need to clarify though, my gm and place of work would of ate the tab.  this isn’t about the tab/tip, and i’m trying to grasp how a couple of you are giving me shit for it. i’ll repeat what i responded to someone,  fuck this job and fuck their tab! ..... these people live a life off of mooching off of hard working people, and who knows what other industries they con.  all i know is that with the chance given, i fucking refuse to to be considered a win in their fucked up con book on this night.  i mean, to each their own, right?",Another_libation,tfys
986,explaining an academic gap in employment in a way that doesn't automatically ding me in interviews?,"long time reader, first time poster. i need some job help. if this is ot/inappropriate, please let me know. 

so, looking to get back into the industry, looking for advice. 

i had a period of time (~2 years) where i was in grad school full time and not working at all except for summer internships in my field. there's no way to explain that gap in my employment outside of grad school. some probably relevant facts: its a top 20-25 university in the country overall and in the same city, so people know its super prestigious. due to medical stuff, i have had to take some delays in finishing up and starting my career so i only work very part time (m-t mornings) at a part time job (edited for clarification) related to my field. so, i need money badly, and want to get back into serving since i liked it, and it fits well with my availability and goals. i have the current licensure in my state. 

however, i feel like i'm running into the problem of people immediately seeing the degree/time in school and thinking ""oh, she's going to leave soon.""  i've tried putting it on the bottom of my resume and removing any academic honors/achievements outside of ""well, i attended xyz university for x program"".  some people have suggested that the reason i'm having trouble finding a serving job is because of that, the whole ""she's going to leave once she finds something better""/""she's overqualified"" nonsense which is complete horseshit anyway. 

i have over a year of catering server/fancy event staff experience. i left on good terms (i left because i had to go to the hospital, and was unable to work after that). i could most likely return, but i'd rather not due to not really getting steady hours/enough hours there. i last worked there in early december 2018 before the hospitalization. 

do i just leave the school stuff off my resume (put my undergrad degree on there) and bring it up in interviews if people ask about the gap in employment?  alternatively, is there another reason i might be getting dinged that i don't know about? i show up to interviews well dressed but not in a full-out suit (usually like nicer side of business casual, definitely well-groomed).
